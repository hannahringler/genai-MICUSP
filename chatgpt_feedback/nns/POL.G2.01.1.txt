Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, clarity, structure, and other relevant aspects:

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Understanding of Wilson’s Argument:**  
   You demonstrate a solid grasp of William Julius Wilson’s thesis in *When Work Disappears*. You correctly highlight his argument that joblessness—not only poverty—drives social disintegration in inner-city neighborhoods.

2. **Logical Structure:**  
   The paper is well organized. You effectively introduce Wilson’s main questions, systematically address each (why jobs are disappearing, why this is concentrated in African American ghettos), and summarize key policy takeaways.

3. **Conciseness and Focus:**  
   Your writing stays focused on Wilson’s arguments and doesn’t stray into unrelated tangents. This ensures that readers can easily follow the progression of your analysis.

4. **Integration of Key Concepts:**  
   You discuss globalization, economic restructuring, suburbanization, and social disorganization, showing a nuanced understanding of the interplay between economic and social factors.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity and Flow:**
   - At times, your transitions between ideas are abrupt. Using more transition sentences would help guide the reader through the interconnected causes and effects you describe.
   - Some longer sentences could be broken up for ease of reading. For example: “Globalization has allowed –and sometimes forced– companies to look for lower paid workers in other countries...” could be more concise.

2. **Depth of Analysis:**
   - You summarize Wilson’s points well, but your own critical analysis is mostly concentrated at the end. Consider weaving more of your voice throughout, for example, by evaluating the strengths and limitations of Wilson’s arguments as you present them.

3. **Use of Evidence:**
   - While you mention that Wilson provides certain examples (e.g., government policies affecting urban areas), you don’t include direct details or illustrative examples. Bringing in specific instances from the book would strengthen your summary and analysis, and show close reading.

4. **Diagram Integration:**
   - You reference Figure 1 (“The Joblessness Trap”). If this were a written assignment with a visual component, ensure the figure is included and referenced clearly in the text. Elaborate a bit more on what the diagram shows (since as written, a reader may not have access to the image).

5. **Formatting and Mechanics:**
   - There are minor typographical issues (e.g., extra hyphens, peculiar character breaks in “African-American” and “phenomena”). Review the paper for these, as well as for consistency in terminology.
   - “Africa-Americans” should be corrected to “African Americans”.
   - The text seems to come from an OCR process and includes footnote/copyright “MICUSP Version…” multiple times; remove these in the final draft.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - While you wrap up with policy takeaways, a more formal conclusion summarizing your overall assessment of Wilson’s work and its significance would give the paper a stronger finish.

**Additional Suggestions:**

- If the assignment allowed, you might compare Wilson’s account with other scholars or contemporary data to provide greater context and critical perspective.
- Clarify your position. For example: do you find Wilson’s arguments convincing? Why or why not? Where might his analysis be improved?

**Sample Revised Paragraph (Opening Example):**

*Original:*  
“Wilson’s answer to the first question is not provocative. Certain types of jobs –especially those that require less formal education - are moving outside of the United States and as a result companies are demanding less American workers. He points out several factors, but most of them relate to two interconnected phenomenon: globalization and the economic restructuring that this is causing in the American economy.”

*Suggested Revision:*  
“Wilson’s answer to the first question is straightforward: jobs that require less formal education are increasingly moving offshore, reducing opportunities for American workers. He identifies two interconnected trends driving this shift: globalization and the resulting economic restructuring within the United States.”

---

**Overall Assessment:**
You show a strong understanding of the text, maintain a good structure, and clearly present Wilson’s central arguments. Improved integration of evidence, your own analytical voice, and attention to organization and detail will make your paper even stronger.
