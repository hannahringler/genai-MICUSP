Certainly! Below is detailed feedback on the paper “Local People Mobilization for China’s Reforestation Project.” The paper presents a research report on motivation and mobilization of local farmers in China’s reforestation initiatives. Feedback addresses content, structure, clarity, analysis, and presentation.

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Well-Structured Content**
- The paper has clear sections: Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Findings, Policy Suggestions, and Conclusion.
- The research question is clear: What motivates or hinders Chinese farmers' participation in reforestation?
- Literature and theoretical frameworks (resource mobilization, collective grievance) are appropriately referenced and connected to the research questions.

### 2. **Clear Comparative Method**
- Comparing Beijing (urban, developed) and Ningxia (rural, developing) offers valuable insight.
- The rationale for sample selection is justified, and demographic data is presented for comparison.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Effective use of charts illustrates the survey results.
- Figures and charts make the demographic and survey data accessible and interpretable.

### 4. **Thoughtful Analysis and Implications**
- The analysis doesn’t just present data; it interprets findings and links them to broader social and economic factors.
- Barriers and facilitators to mobilization are discussed in detail.
- The importance of both economic incentives and social mobilization is recognized.

### 5. **Policy-Relevant Recommendations**
- The paper suggests concrete steps for policymakers.
- It clearly states the limitations of relying solely on economic incentives and recognizes the need for long-term change and social mobilization.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Language and Clarity**
- The language, while generally clear, sometimes shows signs of non-native English (e.g., tense errors, awkward phrasing, subject-verb disagreement).
  - Example: "Farmers has no choice but to plant ecological forest."
  - Consider a thorough proofreading or asking a native speaker to review for clarity, grammar, and smoothness.

### 2. **Deeper Theoretical Engagement**
- While the resource mobilization theory is referenced, the discussion could go deeper. For example:
  - What specific resources were mobilized (e.g., time, money, social capital)? How did these differ between rural/urban populations?
  - How do findings support or challenge the theory?

### 3. **Methodological Rigor**
- The sampling method, while explained, is relatively small and based on convenience samples. This limitation should be more explicitly acknowledged in the methodology/discussion section.
- There’s potential bias in the data collection (e.g., students bringing surveys home to parents). Consider reflecting more critically on how this might affect results.

### 4. **Data Interpretation**
- Some causal inferences are suggested where the data may only support correlation (e.g., assuming educational level causes certain attitudes).
- Qualitative insights from interviews or open-ended responses would add depth and context to the quantitative findings.

### 5. **Use of Citations**
- Reference style is inconsistent. For example, “Lecture notes from Dorceta Taylor, 2008” is informal for an academic report.
- Some in-text citations are missing page numbers or are referred to mid-paragraph, breaking up the flow.
- Double-check the reference list for completeness and formatting.

### 6. **Conclusion & Limitations**
- The conclusion could be expanded to discuss:
  - The broader implications for environmental policy or similar programs in other countries.
  - Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research.

### 7. **Appendix/Charts Clarity**
- Ensure that figures in the appendix are referenced clearly in the main text.
- Some charts (e.g., pie charts with light colors, bar charts without axis labels) could be improved for readability.
- When describing findings, refer specifically to “Figure X shows that…”.

## **Summary Recommendations**

- **Editing for clarity:** Grammar, style, and English-language flow could be improved.
- **Deepen the theory:** Further relate findings to sociological theory—what does the data reveal about mobilization in practice?
- **Reflect on method limits:** Acknowledge sample size, bias, and potential limitations more explicitly.
- **Expand analysis:** Provide qualitative insight and engage further with the data’s implications.
- **Reference style:** Standardize citations and references.
- **Detailed conclusions:** Address limitations, future research, and broader lessons.

**Overall**, this paper is well-organized, draws on sound theory, and offers valuable empirical insight into social-mobilization challenges in a critical area of Chinese environmental policy. With some refinement—editing for language, more rigorous discussion of method, and a deeper connection to sociological theory—it could be even stronger. Great effort!
