## Feedback on SAE Annual Congress Review Response Paper

### **Strengths**

1. **Comprehensive Summary:**  
You provide a thorough overview of the conference session, especially the presentation on the FMVSS 202 upgrade. The summary includes key points, comparisons between current and proposed standards, and the likely impact on industry and safety.

2. **Contextualization:**  
You successfully place individual presentations in context, comparing them with each other (e.g., how Kaleto’s and Patel’s papers both focus on driver safety while Deb and Rehkopf focus on other aspects).

3. **Personal Reflection:**  
It’s great that you reflect on your personal experience at the conference, mentioning what you found interesting (such as the exhibition and specific technologies). This gives your response an engaging, personal dimension.

4. **References:**  
You included full references for each paper discussed, which helps anchor your commentary and would assist readers wishing to pursue the sources.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Clarity and Organization:**  
- The main section summarizing the Kaleto presentation is long and packed with dense information. Try breaking up lengthy paragraphs and explicitly using subheadings or topic sentences to guide readers through key points (e.g., “Summary of Proposed Upgrades,” “Comparison with Existing Standards,” “Anticipated Industry Impact”).
- Summaries of the other presentations (Patel, Paulitz, Deb, Rehkopf) could be more clearly separated for readability.

2. **Critical Engagement:**  
- While you list the proposed upgrades and note they are an improvement, your response would be stronger if you critically evaluated these changes. For example: What are the *potential drawbacks* for safety or manufacturability? Do you see any unintended consequences for consumers or the industry?
- You mention that Kaleto warned the new rule would be a “challenge for industry”—can you elaborate on why? Does the paper discuss possible solutions?
- Regarding the exhibition, can you connect the technologies you saw with broader trends in automotive engineering or human factors?

3. **Language and Tone:**  
- There are minor grammatical errors (e.g., “the presentation…was interesting because this paper proposed…”: the presentation was interesting because the speaker proposed…). Watch for subject-verb agreement and sentence flow.
- Some sentences are quite long and difficult to parse. Try shortening or breaking them up for clarity.  
  Example:  
  “From the description and comparison of the current requirements and the proposed, it was shown that the proposed requirements…” → “The author compared the current and proposed requirements. The proposed changes would…”
- Some phrases are repetitive or unclear. Watch for consistency (e.g., “Kaleto1” → “Kaleto” or “Helen Kaleto” throughout).

4. **Depth of Comparison and Synthesis:**  
- While you do mention how papers differed in focus, consider going one step further: What themes or trends did you notice in how safety is approached? Are dynamic tests becoming more prevalent than static? Are there ongoing debates between test methodologies?
- When you compare the exhibition to the technical sessions, could you explore why engineers, rather than salespeople, were better at explanations, and what that says about the nature of the conference or field?

5. **Conclusion:**  
- Your closing thoughts are positive and personal, which is great! To strengthen the ending, briefly return to what you learned about *human factors in computer systems or vehicle safety* and how this experience might shape your perspective moving forward.

### **Sample Edited Passage**

Original:
> “The proposed requirements would upgrade the current standard by requiring head restraints to be higher, closer to the head, and be available in front and rear outboard positions. She said that the final rule was expected to be released by Sep. 1. 2004, thus, vehicle produced after sep. 1. 2007 would have to meet this requirement. Until then, either of current FMVSS 202, the Economic Commission for Europe Regulation No. 25 (ECE-25) plus 202A width requirement, or FMVSS 202A (proposed) should be satisfied, which allows to predict modifications to the new requirements and test procedures.”

Improved:
> “The proposed requirements would update the current standards by mandating head restraints that are higher, positioned closer to the head, and available in both front and rear outboard positions. Kaleto noted that the final rule was expected by September 1, 2004, taking effect for vehicles produced after September 1, 2007. In the interim, manufacturers could comply with the current FMVSS 202, ECE Regulation No. 25 with width requirements, or the proposed FMVSS 202A, allowing for gradual adjustment to the new standards.”

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a strong and informative response paper. You synthesize and compare technical content from several talks and include thoughtful personal reflection. With clearer organization, a touch more critical analysis, and minor language polish, your work would be even more compelling and academically rigorous.

**Score (if desired):** B+ / A-
