Absolutely—I’d be happy to give you feedback on this paper, both on content and writing style. Here’s a detailed analysis:

---

## **Strengths**

### **Thesis and Argument**
- You establish a clear thesis in the introduction: that "dreams of self-fulfillment" in *The Age of Innocence* are always in tension with the limits of society, and that the generational shift matters to the story’s denouement.
- The paper remains focused throughout, connecting moments from the novel to your claim about dreams, society, and the passage of time.

### **Use of Textual Evidence**
- You analyze specific scenes and quotations from the novel, such as Archer’s vision of escaping with Ellen ("I want—I want...") and the symbolic aspects of his dreams and disappointments.
- The paper effectively discusses the final chapter, bringing Dallas and Fanny’s story into conversation with Newland/Ellen’s unfulfilled desires.

### **Thematic Depth**
- There’s strong attention to themes of time, regret, societal change, and generational difference.
- The metaphor of “space” as a physical, social, and imaginative realm is thoughtfully explored.

### **Organization**
- Each paragraph builds clearly from the last, moving from intimate moments of the protagonists’ encounters to a wider view of society and history.
- The conclusion circles back to your thesis while summing up the implications of historical/social determinism and personal dreams.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### **Clarity and Precision**
- The paper sometimes lapses into abstraction. For example, “space of dreams,” “potential space,” “microcosm of an ideal” are evocative phrases, but some could be clarified with concrete definitions or examples.
    - **Suggestion:** Occasionally “translate” your metaphors into more straightforward claims, e.g., “Archer and Ellen are only able to imagine a life together in short-lived private spaces; the outside world always intervenes.”

### **Originality**
- The analysis of generational change (contrasting Dallas/Fanny with Newland/Ellen) is excellent—consider developing this even further. For instance, could you make an argument about Wharton’s perspective on progress? Does she truly see Dallas and Fanny’s world as better, or is something lost?
- Some points rely heavily on restating events from the plot. Try to focus even more on analysis: **why** does Wharton structure the story this way? What does this say about the nature of desire, or change, or nostalgia?

### **Textual Engagement**
- At times, you paraphrase more than quote. For instance, reducing Ellen’s promise (“I won’t go back”) or the closing image of Archer at the door, you summarize well but could include a few more short, impactful quotations to anchor interpretation.

### **Writing Style**
- The style is generally strong, but some sentences are long and winding, which makes your points less sharp. For example:  
    - “Newland and Ellen’s romance is shaped by their dreams, by the fantasy of their future together. When asked if he wants Ellen for a mistress, Newland responds…” Consider breaking up and clarifying when you move from narrative to analysis.
- Proofread for clarity and conciseness (“We understand the impossibility of Ellen and Archer’s love from the fleeting moments…”) can be condensed for punch (“The fleeting moments of privacy between Ellen and Archer reveal the impossibility of their love”).

## **Summary Judgment**

**This is a strong, thoughtful essay that demonstrates a deep understanding of Wharton’s novel. Your thesis is clear, and your argument is supported by close readings and a sophisticated grasp of theme, narrative voice, and historical context.**

With some additional clarity, precision, and a little more emphasis on interpretation over summary, this paper would be outstanding. Consider tightening up some sentences, using key quotations more directly, and digging even deeper into the “so what” at the end: what do Archer’s and Ellen’s dreams—and their failure to pursue them—say about the human experience more broadly?
