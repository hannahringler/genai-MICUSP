Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper "Hobbes, Durkheim, and Spencer: On the Emergence of a Supra-individual Realm".

---

**Strengths**

1. **Clear Structure and Organization**
   - The paper is well-organized, with clear sections for Hobbes, Spencer, and Durkheim. This makes it easy for readers to follow your arguments and comparisons.

2. **Contextualization**
   - You provide historical background for the theorists, especially Hobbes, which helps situate their arguments and clarify their intentions.

3. **Critical Engagement**
   - Rather than just summarizing each thinker, you critique them and point out gaps (e.g., Hobbes’s lack of detail on the actual process of state formation; Spencer’s lack of accounting for inequalities and structural factors). You also raise insightful questions about the limitations of each theory.

4. **Comparative Analysis**
   - The paper outlines not only the differences but also the complementarities between the theorists (e.g., how Spencer addresses issues of development that Hobbes ignores). Your contrasting of Durkheim’s and Hobbes’s roles for the state, as well as Durkheim’s and Spencer’s views on individual rights and state intervention, is strong.

5. **Use of Examples**
   - The concrete example of education oppression helps illustrate Durkheim’s thesis in real sociopolitical contexts.

6. **Engagement with Secondary Sources**
   - The use of additional texts (Chung, Kim) helps bolster your contextual explanations of Hobbes in particular.

**Areas for Improvement**

1. **Thesis Statement**
   - The purpose of the paper is stated, but your main thesis (the specific insight you want to offer) could be made clearer at the end of your introduction. Is your claim mainly that each theorist conceptualizes "supra-individual realms" in ways reflective of their own contexts and theoretical priorities? Or is it about the strengths and limitations of their views for understanding social order? Clarifying this would give your paper a stronger focal point.

2. **Transitions and Flow**
   - While each section is clear, the transitions between them can be smoother. For example, after discussing Hobbes and moving to Spencer, explicitly signposting the shift ("Building on—but also departing from—Hobbes, Spencer…") can help maintain the narrative flow.

3. **Depth of Analysis for Spencer**
   - The section on Spencer spends significant effort critiquing him, which is great, but the core of his “social organism” analogy and its significance could be fleshed out more before discussion of its limitations. For example, how does this analogy specifically shape ideas about individuality and supra-individual entities?

4. **Durkheim’s Originality**
   - For Durkheim, you do a good job outlining his claims, but you might emphasize more how he differs not only in what he prescribes for the state but in his *methodological* approach (e.g., social facts, collective conscience) as compared to the more individualist premises of Hobbes and Spencer.

5. **Addressing Weaknesses and Counterarguments**
   - You raise questions about Durkheim’s optimism regarding the state, but you could consider more forcefully possible responses he might give, or ways in which he preempts (or fails to preempt) authoritarian misuse. This would strengthen the critical aspect.

6. **Use of Citations**
   - The referencing is appropriate, but at times paraphrasing could be tighter—e.g., avoiding blockiness when citing page numbers or giving more succinct summaries.

7. **Conclusion**
   - The paper lacks a summarizing conclusion pulling together your comparative insights. A brief final paragraph restating your main findings and their implications for understanding the emergence and role of supra-individual realms would make your analysis more cohesive.

**Minor Editing Suggestions**

- Watch for typos and grammatical slips (“Hobbs” instead of “Hobbes”).
- Be consistent in terminology (sometimes “society” and “state” are blurred; clarify when you mean one or the other).
- Some sentences are rather long and could benefit from being split up for clarity.

**Overall Impression**

This is a thoughtful, well-researched, and critically engaged paper. Your insights are valuable and you clearly have a strong grasp of the material and its broader implications. With some tightening of focus, smoother transitions, and a concluding synthesis, this would be an excellent critical essay for a graduate sociology course.

If you’d like, I can suggest a potential revised thesis statement or help you draft a concluding paragraph! Just let me know.
