## Overall Impressions

This paper provides an intriguing and nuanced analysis of Chinese women's experiences in American engineering doctoral programs, with a specific focus on how they negotiate professional and feminine identities amid the pressures of a masculine-dominated discipline. The intersection of ethnicity and gender is explored thoughtfully, and there is a clear effort to move beyond Western-centric categories. The paper’s use of participant observation and interviews is a strength, grounding theoretical arguments in lived experience. 

## Strengths

### 1. **Originality & Contribution**
- The paper adds meaningful nuance to a field often dominated by Western feminist perspectives, highlighting the importance of ethnicity and local context for understanding gender in professionalization processes.
- By centering Chinese women, it brings forward underrepresented voices and challenges blanket assumptions about women in engineering.

### 2. **Engagement with Literature**
- The author demonstrates awareness of key debates and perspectives, citing seminal works such as Connell, Butler, West & Zimmerman, and relevant studies on engineering and gender.
- The critique of existing literature's over-reliance on adaptation-to-masculinity narratives is well-developed.

### 3. **Methodological Approach**
- The combination of in-depth interviews and participant observation grounds the work in rich qualitative detail.
- The reflexivity regarding the author’s own limitations (e.g., incomplete notations or insufficient data in one section) is commendable.

### 4. **Key Findings**
- The examination of “working hard” as a feminine trait for Chinese women is insightful and challenges Western binary constructions of gender roles.
- The analysis of how Chinese women distinguish themselves from other ethnic groups and from women in other academic fields is an effective use of intersectionality.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Clarity and Organization**
- **Thesis Statement**: The core arguments could be stated more explicitly early on. Sometimes the aims and research questions get lost amidst literature review and framing.
- **Structure**: While there is a clear movement from literature to method to findings, some sections (especially the literature review) could be condensed for clarity, with subheadings to clearly demarcate arguments.
- **Transitions**: At times, paragraphs jump between ideas (e.g., from general statements about the field to Chinese women specifically) without clear transitions.

### 2. **Engagement with Empirical Data**
- **Depth of Analysis**: Some quotes from interviews are insightful, but are sometimes left unanalyzed or not fully tied back to the larger argument.
- **Balance between Theory and Data**: The paper is theory-heavy in the initial sections and shifts abruptly to empirical findings. Try to weave theory and data together more; for instance, use participant voices to illustrate or challenge theoretical claims throughout.
- **Data Limitations**: Acknowledge more thoroughly the limitations of the sample size and demographic (14 interviews, all relatively young, mostly single, middle-class) and how that may affect the generalizability of findings.

### 3. **Terminology and Language Use**
- **Awkward Phrasing/Grammar**: There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout (e.g., "women-centered leaning strategies"—should be "learning"; "ethnical" instead of "ethnic"; "girls" instead of "women"). Consider a careful proofreading or asking a native English speaker for suggestions.
- **Use of "Femininity"**: The paper relies heavily on the terms “morally pure/purity” and asserts this as the core of engineering femininity, but it would benefit from clearer explication and engagement with cultural or historical context (What does “purity” mean here, and how is it constructed/sustained?).
- **References to Others**: When comparing "Chinese women" to "American women" or "humanities women," be careful not to reinforce stereotypes; more qualifications and nuances would be helpful.

### 4. **Critical Reflection**
- **Self-Reflection and Bias**: As the researcher may share some characteristics with participants, add more reflexivity regarding positionality.
- **Political Implications**: There is an implicit critique of Western feminism and its application to Chinese women, but the paper could more fully consider what the findings mean for institutional or broader changes in engineering and higher education—what are the possible next steps or interventions?

### 5. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion restates findings but could do more to synthesize main insights and project implications for theory, future research, or policy.
- Consider highlighting the broader contributions to gender and professionalization studies: How should our understanding (and institutional support) change in light of these findings?

## Minor Notes

- There are several notation errors and incomplete citations ("..." or “the notations are to be complemented”)—ensure these are fixed in the final draft.
- Include a reference list if this is for publication or submission.

## Final Thoughts

This is a promising, thought-provoking paper that opens up new perspectives on femininity, ethnicity, and professionalization. With further streamlining and tighter integration between theory and data, it could make a significant contribution both to gender studies and to the sociological study of professionalism in STEM.
