Absolutely! Here is some detailed feedback on your paper, **"Rethinking the 'Cultural Turn' in Class Formation Theory—To be a Marxist or not?"**

---

## Strengths

1. **Clear Structure and Purpose**
   - Your introduction is clear—posing a focused research question about how culturalist approaches have (or have not) advanced Marx’s class theory. 
   - The essay structure is well-signposted: you review Marx, then examine culturalist thinkers (Thompson, Rose), introduce the concept of the “culturalist’s dilemma,” and finally discuss Bourdieu.

2. **Engagement with Theoretical Debates**
   - You reference key theorists (Marx, Wright, Thompson, Rose, Bourdieu) and distinguish between structural and cultural traditions.
   - Concepts such as class-in-itself/for-itself, determinism, and habitus are deployed with confidence.

3. **Critical Analysis**
   - Your critique of culturalist Marxists’ inability to escape economic determinism is nuanced and justified with references to Sewell, Thompson, and Rose.
   - The contrast you draw between Bourdieu and the other theorists is strong and supported by textual evidence.

4. **Use of References**
   - Consistent use of citations (including parenthetical references)—which grounds your discussion in the literature.
   - You point readers to further reading and explain where your critique is bounded by the scope of your sources.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Clarity and Organization**
   - **Topic Sentences:** Some paragraphs could benefit from clearer topic sentences to guide the reader.
   - **Transitions:** Occasionally, transitions between points are abrupt. For example, moving from Rose to Bourdieu would benefit from a brief summary sentence.

2. **Conceptual Clarity**
   - In a few places, definitions could be clarified:
      - The distinction between subjectivity and objectivity in class formation could be even sharper for readers unfamiliar with these debates.
      - The concept of “seriality” as borrowed by Rose is described somewhat abstractly—give a concise real-world example.
   - When you say that “the backbone of this cultural approach is not phenomenology but Marxism,” explain why this is the case for the benefit of less advanced readers.

3. **Depth of Examples**
   - More empirical or illustrative examples would help. For instance, give a brief example from Thompson’s “Making of the English Working Class” to illustrate how experience/culture produces class consciousness.
   - Similarly, when discussing Bourdieu’s “social space” or “habitus,” a concrete everyday-life example would help illustrate your points.

4. **Balanced Critique**
   - The assessment of culturalist approaches is quite critical; consider briefly acknowledging what they do offer (e.g., giving voice to lived experience, complicating simplistic class binaries, etc.) before emphasizing their limitations.

5. **Language and Grammar**
   - Mostly clear, but a few minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings (“they seem to blur views on what elements of economic foundation determines classes…”).
   - Be careful with plural/singular agreement (e.g., “economic base defines classes and that those classes consists of workers and capitalists”—should be “consist of…”).
   - Explain abbreviations on first use, e.g., NNS (“Non-native speaker”?).

6. **Conclusion**
   - The final paragraph is strong but could more explicitly restate the significance of your argument for current class theory debates.
   - Suggest an area for future research or an open question emerging from your critique.

## In Summary

- **Very strong theoretical engagement** and a clear, logical structure.
- **Could improve clarity** with more topic sentences and smoother transitions.
- **More real-world examples** and some acknowledgment of the strengths of culturalist approaches would add depth.
- **Some small language tweaks** and a slightly expanded conclusion would strengthen the work overall.

**Overall, this is an impressive and well-argued paper that demonstrates real engagement with complex theoretical debates. With minor improvements in clarity, illustration, and balance, it would be excellent!**
