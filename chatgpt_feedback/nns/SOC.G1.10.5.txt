Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on the paper, “The Determinants of Attitudes toward Unhappy Marriages in Gansu, China,” based on the provided text and tables:

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Motivation and Context**
- The introduction provides an excellent, culturally specific motivation. The focus on family harmony and the stigma of divorce in traditional Chinese (and especially less developed, multi-ethnic Gansu) society is very well articulated.
- The paper situates itself well in the broader context of modernization, gender roles, religion, and socioeconomics in China. This immediately signals the paper’s relevance.

### 2. **Solid Research Design and Methodology**
- The use of the 2007 Developmental Idealism in China Survey is appropriate, and the sampling (cross-sectional, multistage and clustered sampling) is clearly described.
- There is a good distinction between dependent and independent variables.
- The use of binary logistic regression is suitable given the binary outcome, and the multistep modeling (adding demographic, then socioeconomic, then modernity variables) is systematic.
- The disaggregation of modernity into several ideational factors is especially thoughtful and adds nuance.

### 3. **Comprehensive Analysis**
- The descriptive statistics and clear explanation of variable coding improve transparency.
- Interpretation of both descriptive and regression results demonstrates solid understanding.
- The paper acknowledges discrepancies between descriptive and regression findings, which shows critical thinking.

### 4. **Tables and Data Presentation**
- The inclusion of well-labeled tables (descriptive statistics, distributions, regression results) is very helpful for the reader.
- The explanations accompanying the tables (notes, sample sizes, coding) are thorough.

### 5. **Conclusion**
- The conclusions are well-grounded in the analysis, clearly summarizing main findings and linking them to theory.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Literature Review**
- The introduction briefly mentions prior research and context, but there is little actual engagement with existing literature on marriage, divorce, and modernization in China or similar societies. 
- Consider adding a short section or paragraph summarizing what previous research has found, and how your study extends or differs from it.

### 2. **Theoretical Framework**
- “Modernity factors” are mentioned, but the theoretical reasoning for including each (beyond a general link to tolerance/personal freedom) could be elaborated. You might explicitly connect your hypotheses to modernization theory, or similar conceptual frameworks, to make your study more theoretically anchored.

### 3. **Interpretation Nuance**
- While the results are generally interpreted well, some findings (like the reversal of the effect of social class between descriptive stats and regression) deserve more discussion. What might explain these reversals? Are there possible omitted variables or confounding factors?
- The effect of education shows a non-linear trend (it increases up to a point, then drops and becomes insignificant), but this is not discussed much. Why might college education not further increase preference for divorce?

### 4. **Limitations**
- There is little explicit discussion of study limitations. Address possible sources of bias (e.g., cross-sectional data, self-reported attitudes, regional generalizability), or the possibility that the survey’s forced-choice design oversimplifies attitudes.
- Discuss sample limitations (e.g., only Gansu, only 633 respondents), and how this might limit broader generalization.

### 5. **Implications and Future Research**
- The study has strong findings, but does not discuss wider policy implications or suggest specific avenues for future research. Adding a paragraph on what these findings mean for policymakers, or what further questions emerge, would add value.

### 6. **Language and Clarity**
- There are minor language errors and awkward phrases (“the odds has been increasing from 2.193, 2.589, 3.216 to 3.354…”) which can be improved for smoother English.
- At times, sentences are too long and could be broken for clarity.
- Ensure all technical terms (e.g., “odds ratio,” “log-likelihood,” etc.) are briefly defined for non-technical readers.

## Sample Additional Paragraph for Discussion

> "One interesting finding is the reversed effect of self-assigned social class between descriptive and regression analyses. This may suggest that observed associations are confounded by other variables such as education or attitudes toward modernity, which highlight the importance of multivariate analysis in social research. Additionally, while education is generally hypothesized to increase tolerance for divorce, the lack of a significant effect for college degrees and above may indicate a ceiling effect, regional differences, or cultural factors specific to Gansu. Further qualitative research could help uncover nuanced explanations behind these results."

## Final Recommendation

**This is a strong, data-driven paper that makes a real contribution to understanding marriage attitudes in a rarely-studied setting. With expansion of the literature review, more explicit discussion of theory, deeper interpretation of certain results, and acknowledgment of limitations, the paper would be suitable for a graduate-level sociology seminar or even for further development into a publication.**
