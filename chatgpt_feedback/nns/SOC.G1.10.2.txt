Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your essay based on the text you provided:

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Clear Structure and Organization**
- Your paper is well-organized: you introduce each theorist (Polanyi, Arendt, Alexander), outline their core ideas, and compare them thoughtfully.
- There is a clear progression from individual summaries to comparative analysis.

### **2. Strong Grasp of Theoretical Concepts**
- Your understanding of complex concepts such as “embeddedness” (Polanyi), “the right to have rights” (Arendt), and “solidarity” (Alexander) is apparent, and you explain them in context.
- You effectively use quotations and references from primary and secondary sources to support your arguments.

### **3. Comparative Analysis**
- You move beyond simple summaries and make connections between the theorists, such as shared opposition to “biological human nature” and the process-oriented view of the state-market-society relationship.
- You note both commonalities and differences in their approaches.

### **4. Academic Style**
- The essay demonstrates a good command of academic English, using terminology appropriate for a graduate-level course.
- You reference other scholars accurately.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### **1. Clarity and Expression**
- At times, your sentence structure is overly complex or indirect, making some arguments difficult to follow. For example:
  - “Because of institution’s social and historical complexity and enrichment, Polanyi successfully arrange the above three objects into the two ‘spheres’ without ‘separating economy from the social’…”
    - *Suggestion*: Try simplifying sentence structures: “Polanyi uses the complexity and richness of institutions to show how the market, state, and civil society interact, rather than seeing them as strictly separated.”
- Sometimes pronouns or references are unclear (“the above three objects”—spell out what you mean to help the reader).

### **2. Grammar and Vocabulary**
Some minor grammatical errors recur:
- Subject/verb agreement: “Polanyi successfully arrange” → “Polanyi successfully arranges”
- Articles: “an artifact of institutional arrangements” (good), but “involved in various human relations and the interdependence is the most valued” could be “and interdependence is most valued.”
- Use of “infofar” should be “insofar.”

### **3. Introduction and Thesis**
- Your introduction could do a better job of framing your argument. As it stands, you jump quickly into Polanyi’s argument. Consider a brief introductory paragraph outlining your main comparison and what is at stake in examining these theorists together.

### **4. Topic Sentences and Transitions**
- Some paragraphs begin abruptly or with quotations. Try to start with a clear topic sentence that signals what the paragraph will discuss.
- Example: When moving to Arendt, you could write: “While Polanyi focuses on the ways economic institutions are embedded in society, Arendt shifts attention to the relationship between rights, citizenship, and political belonging.”

### **5. Conclusion**
- Your conclusion summarizes the main points well, but it could be stronger in synthesizing your overall argument or reflecting on the contemporary relevance of these theories.

### **6. Citations and Reference List Formatting**
- Reference list is thorough, but check for minor spelling/formatting errors: “Kripper, G. R.” should be “Krippner, G. R.”
- Ensure in-text citations consistently match reference list.

## **Overall Evaluation**

Your paper shows a strong comprehension of advanced sociological theory, and the comparative analysis among Polanyi, Arendt, and Alexander is thoughtful and well-supported. Some language and structural revisions will help with readability and polish, but the core analytic work is very solid.

### **Steps to Improve**
1. **Revise for clarity:** Edit for shorter, clearer sentences.
2. **Strengthen your introduction and conclusion:** Clearly state your comparative thesis upfront, and synthesize your findings at the end.
3. **Polish grammar and transitions:** Proofread for grammar and flow, ensuring each paragraph leads smoothly into the next.

**Example of a revised paragraph for clarity:**
> Polanyi’s concept of “embeddedness” demonstrates how economic life is inseparable from social institutions. Rather than seeing the market, state, and civil society as separate and distinct, Polanyi argues that they are historically and socially interwoven. This critique challenges liberalism by arguing that markets cannot function independently of state intervention or social regulation.
