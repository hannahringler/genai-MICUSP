Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on the provided critique of Martin Weitzman’s *The Share Economy*:

---

### **Strengths**

**1. Clear Thesis and Purpose**
- The paper presents a strong, clearly stated thesis: that Weitzman’s share economy model, though well-intentioned, would inadvertently harm the very workers it aims to help.

**2. Analytical Depth**
- The critique demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of economic concepts, especially regarding marginal revenue, wage dynamics, and the influence of labor incentives.
- The paper engages directly with Weitzman’s own arguments, sometimes citing specific page numbers, demonstrating close reading and careful analysis.

**3. Logical Structure**
- The argument unfolds logically, beginning with a summary of Weitzman’s aims, followed by stepwise critiques of the wage system, worker incentives, dependence on unions and firms, instability of wages, and the externalities/public good argument.

**4. Use of Evidence**
- Specific references to both Weitzman and Mankiw foreground your analysis in real economic literature.
- The use of mathematical representation (even if not visually rendered here) adds rigor to the arguments.

**5. Writing Style**
- The paper has an engaging, occasionally witty style (the “legions of courageous, downtrodden…” passage, for example), adding personality and readability.

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Mathematical Exposition**
- The paper includes equations and refers to marginal revenue and wage calculations but glosses over the math quickly. Consider explaining the core mathematical steps in words for clarity, especially for readers less comfortable with equations.
- When stating "the marginal wage is greater than zero only if..."—a short intuitive explanation would help non-technical readers follow your point.

**2. Depth of Counterarguments**
- While the critique is sharp, it sometimes assumes Weitzman’s defenses are easily dismissed (e.g., waving away concern about “artificially privileged” workers). Consider engaging more deeply with *why* Weitzman believes these issues are surmountable, or what empirical evidence might support/undermine them.
- Explicitly acknowledge any real-world systems (like profit-sharing or co-ops) that have similarities to Weitzman’s model. Do they validate or challenge your critique?

**3. Empirical or Historical Evidence**
- The argument would benefit from at least brief mention of real-world systems resembling share economies, or other economists’ responses to Weitzman’s proposals. This adds weight and context to your theoretical critique.

**4. Tone and Language**
- The tone is occasionally sarcastic (“rosy haze,” “miracles are few and far between,” “propaganda”), which can be engaging but risks undermining academic neutrality if overused. Try balancing cleverness with professionalism.
- The final plea (“just please, leave us alone!”) is memorable, but may seem more rhetorical than analytical. Consider ending on a slightly more formal, solution-oriented note.

**5. Structure and Flow**
- In a few places, long paragraphs cover multiple ideas—consider breaking these up for readability.
- Clearer topic sentences at the start of some paragraphs would help guide the reader.
