Absolutely! Here is a **detailed feedback** on your paper, “Effect of Anxiety to Citizens: Does Anxiety Facilitate or Deteriorate Citizens’ Motivation and Capacity to Political Information and Activity?”, according to criteria typical of upper-level graduate work in political science or psychology:

---

## 1. **Thesis and Research Question**

**Strengths:**
- The main question—whether anxiety facilitates or impedes citizens’ political learning and engagement—is clear, timely, and relevant to political psychology.
- You concisely identify the theoretical tension in the literature (primarily between Affective Intelligence Theory (AIT) and its critics).

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The thesis would be clearer if stated in one or two crisp sentences upfront. Instead, the purpose and argument are developed gradually across the introduction.
- Consider tightening the opening to foreground your argument: "This paper argues that the effects of anxiety on political information-seeking depend on the perceived certainty of threat and the individual’s sense of competence in managing it."

## 2. **Structure and Organization**

**Strengths:**
- The paper is logically divided: Intro → Review of AIT → Critiques → Experimental Evidence → Contingencies → Conclusion.
- Each section addresses a necessary component of the argument and synthesizes relevant scholarship.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some sections, especially those summarizing experiments, could be more concise and thematic. Group findings to highlight trends rather than listing individual studies sequentially.
- Introductions and conclusions of sections can be more explicit in summarizing their contributions to the overall argument.

## 3. **Use of Literature**

**Strengths:**
- You reference a strong selection of primary studies and reviews, demonstrating wide reading (Brader, Crigler, Holbrook, Marcus et al., etc.).
- Summaries are accurate, and you discuss theoretical nuances, such as distinguishing between anxiety and aversion.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Several studies cited as "unpublished"—whenever possible, use peer-reviewed sources for core points, or explain lack of alternatives.
- Sometimes, the summaries become dense with findings. Be sure to explicitly link each study’s evidence back to your thesis.

## 4. **Argumentation and Critical Analysis**

**Strengths:**
- You go beyond summary, offering critical interpretations (e.g., that anxiety’s effect is context-dependent, or that correlations between aversion and anxiety may be underestimated).
- The paper avoids simple dichotomies, instead proposing a more complex, contingent model.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Your critique of previous work (e.g., issues of measurement, or assumed mechanisms in AIT) is well-taken, but could be sharpened. Where you suggest possible flaws in other authors’ designs or definitions, try to offer a precise example or hypothetical improvement.
- The proposal for contextualizing anxiety’s effects is promising but would benefit from more concrete operationalization or hypothetical case studies.

## 5. **Writing Quality and Clarity**

**Strengths:**
- Despite being by a non-native speaker, overall prose is clear and communicates complex ideas.
- Most paragraph transitions are smooth.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- There are occasional grammatical errors, awkward phrasings, or word choices (“leaning capability” should be “learning capability”; “shift attention of the people to novel stimuli” could be simplified to “shifts people’s attention to novel stimuli”).
- Some sentences are long and convoluted. Watch for run-ons and break into shorter statements.
- Terminology: Be precise in differentiating terms like “anxiety,” “aversion,” and “fear.” Where definitions are ambiguous, clarify your usage.

## 6. **Originality and Contribution**

**Strengths:**
- The idea to contextualize anxiety effects by both threat certainty and citizen efficacy is original and valuable.
- You synthesize psychological and political science literatures in a way that few papers at the graduate level attempt.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Push your theoretical framework further—your two-axes idea (certainty, efficacy) could be visualized or presented in a simple table/model for clarity.
- End with one or two concrete suggestions for future research designs that could empirically test your proposals.

## 7. **References and Citation**

**Strengths:**
- Citations are comprehensive and formatted appropriately for the most part.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- If possible, update with more recent sources or clarify which studies are peer-reviewed and which are unpublished working papers.

---

### **OVERALL EVALUATION**

**Grade Estimate: B+/A- (Strong, but with room for greater clarity and precision in argument and prose).**

**Summary of Key Recommendations:**
- State your thesis more clearly and upfront in the introduction.
- Further organize and synthesize evidence (group studies, highlight contrasts explicitly).
- Strengthen critique of existing models with practical examples.
- Clarify language and fix grammatical errors for maximum clarity.
- Push the originality of your contingency model—maybe diagram it, and give concrete research implications.

**This is a strong and ambitious essay that shows a deep engagement with the topic and the literature. Well done! With some polishing and tightening, this could be even stronger, and possibly ready for publication as a short research note or review.**
