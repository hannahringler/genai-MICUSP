**Feedback on "Safer, Stronger" Paper**

### **Strengths**

1. **Analytical Depth:**
   - The paper shows real analytical engagement with the ad, especially in the author's decision to watch it with and without sound in order to dissect the effects of audio-visual elements. This is a creative and strong critical approach.

2. **Integration of Course Concepts:**
   - The author draws thoughtfully on lecture materials and readings (Mark’s *Going Dirty*, Iyengar and McGrady’s *Media Politics*, West’s “Overview of Ads”). These references help situate the ad within broader themes in political communication, like “issue ownership” and the use of symbols.

3. **Clear Description:**
   - The visual and thematic descriptions of the ad are vivid and detailed. Readers who haven’t seen the spot can still get a solid sense of its content and style.

4. **Critical Perspective:**
   - The writer questions the effectiveness of the Bush campaign’s ad, identifying possible unintended consequences. These critical insights demonstrate independent thinking.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### **1. Organization and Structure**
- **Paragraphing:** The essay could benefit from improved paragraph division. Often, one paragraph covers several points or themes; clearer separations would aid readability and make the argument easier to follow.

- **Thesis Statement:** The introduction would be stronger with a more explicit thesis statement. Early on, clarify the main argument or evaluation: Is the ad effective or ineffective? Why?

#### **2. Clarity and Conciseness**
- **Wordiness and Repetition:** Some sentences are overly long or repeat similar points (e.g., about the ad’s gloomy tone). Aim for shorter, sharper sentences that drive the analysis forward.

- **Grammar and Syntax:** There are minor grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles, singular/plural mismatches, awkward phrasings—e.g., “it could raise a question that could serious hurt” should be “could seriously hurt”). Pay attention to verb tense and agreement.

#### **3. Evidence and Argument Development**
- **Specific Examples:** At several points, you could be more precise. For example, when discussing the “sounds in the background” or “ethically suspect” editing techniques, cite exact moments or images.

- **Counterargument:** You perceptively note the ad’s possible backfiring. Bringing in more direct evidence (such as polling data, public reactions, or expert opinions, if available) would strengthen this point.

#### **4. Conclusion**
- The concluding remarks are insightful but could be more forceful. Restate your main argument more clearly, and expand a bit on what can be learned from this analysis about political advertising more broadly.

#### **5. Formatting and Presentation**
- **Citations:** Consider providing full references for your cited sources.
- **Typos:** Double-check for minor typos (e.g., “Gorge Walker Bush” should be “George Walker Bush”).

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a thoughtful and perceptive critique of a political ad, notable for its creative analysis and integration of outside materials. With a little more polish in organization, clarity, and precision, the paper would be even stronger. Tightening your argument and making your main claims more explicit in both the introduction and conclusion will enhance clarity and persuasiveness.

**Grade Estimate (if applicable):** B+/A- range, with room to improve further on writing mechanics and argumentative clarity.
