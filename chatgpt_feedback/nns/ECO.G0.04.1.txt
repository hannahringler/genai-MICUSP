Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on the paper, focusing on structure, content, analysis, use of sources, and writing style.

---

**Overall Assessment:**  
This paper provides a critical and well-reasoned analysis of the FTC's decision to approve the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. It correctly identifies and assesses both the potential harms to competition and the rationale used by the Department of Defense and the FTC. The use of primary sources and regulatory documents significantly strengthens the argument. The tone is appropriately skeptical and analytical, matching the paper’s critical stance toward both the regulatory process and media coverage.

## **Strengths**

1. **Clear Structure and Organization**
   - The paper opens with a summary of the Wall Street Journal’s reporting, proceeds to independent analysis, and ends with a bibliography and cited endnotes.  
   - The argument follows a logical progression from market structure to analysis of competitive harms, government justification, and concerns with the decision.

2. **Depth of Economic Analysis**
   - The author correctly identifies the relevant product and geographic markets, vertical and horizontal integration concerns, and summarizes the anti-competitive risks in both.
   - The discussion of rule of reason and comparison with past cases (General Motors) reflects understanding of antitrust principles.

3. **Effective Use of Evidence**
   - Extensive referencing to FTC documents, government accountability reports, and journalistic sources shows good research and comprehensive engagement with the topic.

4. **Critical Approach**
   - Questioning the DoD’s reliability as a sole consumer and the sufficiency of structural remedies is insightful.
   - The skepticism toward both the regulatory rationale and media reporting is well-justified.

5. **Sophisticated Writing**
   - The language and tone are generally appropriate for an upper-level undergraduate economics paper.

## **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Introduction and Thesis Clarity**
   - The opening paragraph is informative but could be revised to more clearly state the thesis. Consider a stronger, more specific claim about what the paper will prove (e.g., "This paper will demonstrate that the FTC’s approval of the ULA joint venture inadequately accounts for long-term competitive harm and public interest.")

2. **Paragraph Structure**
   - Some paragraphs, especially early on, are quite dense. Breaking these into shorter, more focused paragraphs would improve readability and the flow of arguments.

3. **Explanation of Key Concepts**
   - Some technical terms (e.g., “rule of reason”, “vertical integration”) could be briefly defined for clarity, especially given that readers may not all have antitrust expertise.

4. **Stronger Conclusion**
   - The paper ends somewhat abruptly after criticizing the media and the policymaking process. Add a short concluding paragraph summarizing the main findings and restating the risks for competition and public interest, possibly with a recommendation for future policy or oversight.

5. **Objectivity and Tone**
   - While a critical stance is warranted, phrases like “such irresponsible policymaking” risk coming across as polemical. Slightly more measured language would help maintain a scholarly tone.

6. **Minor Editing**
   - There are places with awkward wording or typos (e.g., "can reasonably modeled" should be “can reasonably be modeled”; “launch team from working on all the DoD’s launches, rather than the fraction of all launches that each parent company worked on,” could be clarified).  
   - “Lack the technical expertise” quotation: Consider clarifying whose voice this is for readability.

7. **Contextualizing the Impact**
   - A brief statement about the broader significance (e.g., the precedent this case sets for future government contracting and consolidation) could help emphasize why the case matters beyond this specific context.

## **Recommendations for Revision**

- Refine the introduction and add a concise, powerful conclusion.
- Break up longer paragraphs for clarity.
- Define technical terms briefly when first introduced.
- Soften language to strengthen objectivity.
- Do a careful edit for grammar and phrasing.

**Overall, this is a thoughtful and well-researched paper demonstrating a deep engagement with competition policy and the specific case at hand. With some tightening and a clearer thesis/conclusion, it would be an excellent final-year undergraduate paper.**
