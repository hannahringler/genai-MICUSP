## Overall Feedback

### Strengths

1. **Thorough Systems Approach**:  
   You skillfully examine *The Broken Cord* from multiple systemic perspectives—family, school, and culture. This multidimensional analysis gives depth and nuance to your paper.

2. **Thoughtful Reflections**:  
   You demonstrate empathy for the main characters and engage personally with the material, which enriches your argument and shows a deep understanding of the psychological impact of FAS (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome).

3. **Integration of Literature**:  
   Your references to Goldberg, Farella, and other texts support your discussion and reflect good academic practice.

4. **Clear Structure**:  
   The use of sub-headings and a logical progression from introduction through analysis and implications to conclusion are very effective.

5. **Relevant Application**:  
   You consider not only what is, but what could be—specifically, the roles of psychologists and society in prevention and intervention.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Thesis Clarity**:
   - **Current Status**: While your systems focus comes through, your main argument could be stated more clearly and directly in the introduction.
   - **Suggestion**: End your introduction with a precise thesis statement outlining what your systems perspective will reveal about FAS, its impact, and intervention.

2. **Transitions & Cohesion**:
   - **Current Status**: Sometimes, new sections start abruptly. For example, moving from family to school/cultural systems could flow better.
   - **Suggestion**: Use brief transitional sentences to connect sections. E.g., "Having examined the challenges within the family, it is essential to see how these interact with broader social institutions, starting with the school system."

3. **Analytical Depth**:
   - **Current Status**: You present the challenges and systems well, but your analysis sometimes remains descriptive. There are opportunities for deeper critical engagement—for example, to question underlying assumptions or propose specific intervention strategies.
   - **Suggestion**: Try exploring more "why" and "how" questions, or predicting possible consequences of certain interventions.

4. **Clarity & Conciseness**:
   - **Current Status**: Some sentences are long and complex, occasionally making your point hard to follow.
   - **Suggestion**: Use shorter sentences and clearer phrasing, especially when summarizing key ideas or introducing new concepts.

5. **Balanced Perspective**:
   - **Current Status**: You discuss the Native American context respectfully, but some statements risk generalization (e.g., "even infants drank alcohol...").
   - **Suggestion**: Add qualifiers where appropriate—e.g., "According to the text, it is reported that on some reservations..."

6. **APA Style (if required)**:
   - **Current Status**: The references are generally formatted well, but double-check whether your department requires APA (or another) citation style (in-text citations, reference list format, etc.).
   - **Suggestion**: Ensure that in-text citations match the required style, and all references are complete.

### Section-by-Section Specific Feedback

**Introduction**
- Good overview, but could be more compelling with a stronger thesis.
- The emotional engagement is a nice touch.

**Family Systems**
- Good use of literature (Goldberg & Goldberg).
- Interesting exploration of subsystem boundaries but could use more examples from *The Broken Cord* text itself, rather than hypothetical scenarios.

**Broader System Contexts**
- The school system discussion is insightful and relatable.
- The cultural discussion is ambitious and critical. You do well to cite Farella and bring in spiritual/cultural frameworks.
- Be careful to avoid overgeneralization regarding Native Americans—try to anchor statements to either the book or supporting literature.

**Implications for Intervention**
- Clear identification of roles for each system.
- Might benefit from concrete examples of successful interventions (where possible).
- Discussion of barriers and limitations is strong—consider suggesting solutions to these challenges.

**Role of Clinical Psychology**
- Excellent discussion about the bridging role of clinical psychologists.
- Expand briefly on how clinical psychologists could actively structure collaborations between systems.

**Conclusion**
- Sums up the paper effectively.
- You end on a hopeful note, which is appropriate.

### Minor Issues

- Watch for minor typos (e.g., "if what the appropriate subsystem..." should probably be "is what the appropriate subsystem...").
- A few awkward phrasings (e.g., "the author mentions that Native American women give birth to FAS children to receive more money from the government") could be clarified to avoid potential misinterpretation.
- Double-check for run-on sentences.

## Summary

**Grade Estimate**: A- to B+ (depending on rubric and weight on critical analysis)

**Key Strengths**: Well-structured, empathetically argued, good integration of systems concepts and literature.

**Priorities for Improvement**:
- Tighten your thesis.
- Deepen analysis in each systems section (ask more “why,” "how," and “what if?”).
- Be mindful of generalizations; ground claims in text or research.
- Clarify and condense where possible.

This is a thoughtful and well-argued paper. With a few edits for clarity, depth, and precision, it could be even stronger!
