Absolutely! Here’s a detailed, constructive feedback on your paper "On Frames and Resistance in Pride and Prejudice":

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Original Thesis and Thematic Focus:**  
Your exploration of "frames"—social, familial, and aesthetic—as both literal and metaphorical boundaries is thoughtful and original. You skillfully tie these to concepts of resistance and constraint in the novel, which shows a nuanced understanding.

2. **Integration of Close Reading:**  
Your analysis of key passages (e.g., Lady Catherine's admonitions, the picturesque scene, and descriptions of Pemberley vs. Longbourn) demonstrates strong textual engagement. Quoting and analyzing significant phrases like "quit the sphere" and "charmingly group’d" strengthens your argument.

3. **Use of Secondary Sources:**  
Citing Nina Auerbach adds scholarly depth, and referencing Gilpin introduces an interesting historical/contextual angle with the picturesque.

4. **Effective Structure and Development:**  
The paper moves logically from introduction, through thematic exploration, to close readings and synthesis. You revisit framing devices at the conclusion, closing the argumentative loop.

5. **Clarity and Fluid Prose:**  
Generally, your prose is clear, academic, and engaging. Many sentences are well-constructed and insightful.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Thesis Statement:**  
While your introduction gestures at your main ideas, your overall argument could be stated more clearly and concisely. A direct thesis (e.g., “Austen uses frames—social, spatial, and aesthetic—to expose and challenge the limits society imposes, and her main characters resist and redefine these boundaries, reshaping their own identities and communities”) at the end of your first paragraph would help orient the reader.

2. **Topic Sentences and Organization:**  
While the paper has a logical flow, some paragraphs could open with clearer topic sentences tied to your thesis about “frames” and “resistance.” This helps guide the reader through your argument step by step.

3. **Analysis Depth:**  
You sometimes introduce fascinating ideas (e.g., the “invisibility” of Longbourn versus the solidity of Pemberley) but could push the analysis one step further. For instance, what are the implications for gender and power, or for Austen’s critique of class? Try to end each analytical section with a sentence that links your precise observations to your argument as a whole.

4. **Use of Secondary Sources:**  
You cite Auerbach and Gilpin, but only briefly. Consider weaving in more scholarly perspectives or addressing possible counterarguments. For example, how might a critic argue that the novel *reinforces* rather than resists social boundaries?

5. **Balance of Summary and Analysis:**  
At times, there’s a bit more summary of events or description than necessary. Aim to use plot points mainly as evidence for analytical claims, rather than as stand-alone details.

6. **Conclusion:**  
Your conclusion wraps up your findings well but could go a bit further to address broader implications. What might your argument suggest about Austen’s intentions or her lasting legacy regarding social mobility, gender, or class?

7. **Citations/Formatting:**  
Make sure your citations match a consistent style (MLA or another) and check page numbers if quoting from a specific edition, as you do.

**Quick Fixes:**

- Double-check parenthetical citations and ensure they’re all uniform.
- Occasionally, wordiness obscures your point; strive for clarity and conciseness.
- Watch for small typos (“disenabled” should be “disabled” or “prevented”).

**Overall Evaluation:**

This is a strong, insightful essay that demonstrates excellent textual analysis, creative thematization, and engagement with secondary sources. With a little polishing—especially a stronger thesis, more explicit topic sentences, and slightly deeper engagement with critical perspectives—this could be an excellent undergraduate paper.

If you revise, focus on clarifying your central argument, tightening each analytic section, and connecting your points more directly to larger critical conversations. Excellent job overall!
