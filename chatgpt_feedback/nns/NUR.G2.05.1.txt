Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, “Adolescent Condom Use and the Theory of Planned Behavior.” This feedback will address **content, structure, use of evidence, logic, style, and mechanics**.

---

## **1. Content and Understanding**

**Strengths:**
- **Thorough Background:** You provide a comprehensive overview of adolescent sexual behaviors, their consequences, and the statistics related to condom use, STI, and pregnancy rates.
- **Theoretical Framework:** You effectively describe the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), referencing its development, core components (attitude, perceived control, subjective norms), and its relevance to condom use.
- **Literature Integration:** The review of research highlights strengths and limitations of existing studies and situates your discussion well within current knowledge gaps.
- **Policy and Practice:** You include real-world initiatives and policy (Title X, Healthy People 2010), and even touch on public knowledge and family communication.

**Suggestions:**
- **Depth of Analysis:** While you summarize studies well, you could engage more critically with their methodologies and findings. For instance, discuss how self-report biases, social desirability, or sample characteristics may specifically affect the generalizability of conclusions.
- **TPB Mechanisms:** Consider illustrating, with examples, how each TPB construct might be targeted in interventions (e.g., how can perceived behavioral control be increased?).
- **Cultural Diversity:** There is a brief mention of cross-national differences, but addressing cultural variations in adolescent attitudes about condoms (beyond the US) would strengthen your paper’s applicability.

## **2. Structure and Organization**

**Strengths:**
- Your paper has a logical flow: Introduction → Problem Overview → Theoretical Framework → Literature Review → Public Knowledge/Policy → Future Directions → References.
- Paragraph structure is generally clear, and topic sentences guide the reader.

**Suggestions:**
- **Transitions:** Some transitions between sections or paragraphs are abrupt. For example, when moving from public knowledge to policy, a bridging sentence would help maintain flow.
- **Conclusion:** The “Future Potential” section serves as a conclusion, but is somewhat brief. Summarize key findings, practical implications, and offer a more compelling final statement on the importance of the issue and your recommendations.
- **Appendix Reference:** You mention an Appendix for a conceptual map, but it is not included in your text. Be sure to include or at least briefly describe what this conceptual map would show.

## **3. Use of Evidence**

**Strengths:**
- You use current and relevant sources, mostly from credible academic or governmental organizations.
- Statistics are employed compellingly to ground your argument in real-world urgency.

**Suggestions:**
- **More Recent Sources:** Most sources are from the early 2000s. Consider supplementing with literature post-2010, especially if this is not a historical review.
- **Source Integration:** Some in-text citations are piled up without integrating the source material fluidly into your own argument. Try to synthesize rather than stack information from different sources.
- **Balance Quantitative/Qualitative Evidence:** You mainly reference quantitative studies. Are there qualitative insights on adolescent attitudes or barriers to condom use? Briefly incorporating these could provide richer context.

## **4. Logic and Argumentation**

**Strengths:**
- Your argument for advancing TPB-based interventions to promote condom use is well-supported.
- You recognize the limitations and gaps in existing literature—this shows critical thinking.

**Suggestions:**
- **Clarify Claims:** Sometimes, statements about the absolute effectiveness of the TPB sound overconfident given the noted research gaps. Frame these as hypotheses or possibilities pending more research.
- **Overgeneralization:** You occasionally generalize from specific populations (e.g., university students) to all adolescents; make these distinctions clear.

---

## **5. Writing Style and Mechanics**

**Strengths:**
- Generally formal, clear, and concise. Appropriate for a graduate-level paper.
- Citations and references follow a recognizable style (APA).

**Suggestions:**
- **Grammar:** Some minor grammatical or typographical errors (“a appropri-ation” should be “an appropriation;” “mean” instead of “means” in “effective mean of determining”), and some run-on sentences.
- **Redundancy:** Repetitions—e.g., mentioning “initiatives regarding the reduction of HIV and STI transmission” twice in close succession.
- **Clarity of Terms:** Sometimes terms like “perceived behavioral control” could be defined more simply for clarity.

---

## **6. Formatting and Technical Issues**

**Strengths:**
- Consistent formatting in section titles and references. 
- Pagination/naming is clear.

**Suggestions:**
- **Appendix A not included:** Be sure you actually attach or reference it.
- **Reference Consistency:** Ensure reference style is uniform and follows the latest APA guidelines (if required).

---

## **Summary of Recommendations

1. **Strengthen transitions** and add a more comprehensive conclusion.
2. **Critically discuss research limitations** and be careful about broad generalizations.
3. **Incorporate recent evidence** and, if possible, qualitative research or cultural perspectives.
4. **Proofread for grammar and clarity.**
5. **Include all referenced appendices or conceptual diagrams.**

**Overall,** this is a very solid academic paper that demonstrates understanding of the problem, effective use of theory, and thoughtful engagement with literature. With a few refinements, you could elevate it from very good to excellent!
