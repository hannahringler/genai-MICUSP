Certainly! Here is some detailed feedback on your essay, **“Satire and Morality in The Vicar of Wakefield”**, that considers content, structure, argumentation, evidence, and style:

---

## Strengths

**1. Original Argument and Insight**
- You make a strong, original argument that Goldsmith’s satire does not simply target vice, but also exposes the inadequacy of “innocence and gullibility” as embodied by Dr. Primrose.  
- The essay insightfully contrasts Dr. Primrose’s rigid morality with more “multi-faceted” characters, showing how the outcome depends on adaptability and even deception, rather than pure virtue.

**2. Close Reading and Use of Textual Evidence**
- Your analysis is supported with well-chosen quotations (“my sumptuary edicts,” “dirty fingers,” etc.) that effectively illustrate Primrose’s ineffectiveness and his preoccupation with class.
- You interpret these passages thoughtfully, especially in relation to class, authority, and appearance versus reality.

**3. Structure and Flow**
- The essay is organized logically: you establish your thesis, examine Dr. Primrose’s character, analyze the contrast with William Thornhill, and discuss the implications for the novel’s ending.
- Transitions between points are smooth, and each paragraph builds upon the last.

**4. Engagement with the Novel’s Ironies**
- You are attentive to the ironies and ambiguities at play in the novel’s ending, recognizing that the “restoration” of the family is not wholly rooted in virtue.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Clarifying and Strengthening the Thesis**
- While your thesis is perceptive, it could be made more explicit at the outset. Consider stating more directly in your introduction **how** the novel challenges the typical function of satire (i.e., that instead of simply punishing vice, it questions the effectiveness of virtue itself in a corrupt world).

**2. Development of Secondary Arguments**
- You raise the crucial point that the novel ends with the apparent triumph of fortune and trickery, not virtue. However, you might develop this further. For example:
    - What is Goldsmith suggesting about the possibility of moral living in society?
    - Is there any hope left for virtue, or is the ending wholly cynical?
    - Does the novel provide any critique or alternative to the systems (social, legal, economic) that favor guile over goodness?

**3. Counterarguments or Alternative Readings**
- Consider addressing potential counterarguments. Some critics might say the novel ultimately reaffirms virtue through the restoration of the family. Engaging briefly with this view could strengthen your argument by showing why you disagree.

**4. More about Satiric Conventions**
- While you mention the “conventions of satire,” a brief explanation of what those are—perhaps with an example from another work—could help clarify how Goldsmith diverges from them.

**5. Sentence Clarity and Grammar**
- Some sentences are quite long and complex, which can make your argument harder to follow. For example:
    - “He is a man of thoughts ideals that do not reflect in his actions.” This could be clarified as: “He is a man whose ideals are not reflected in his actions.”
    - Double-check for minor grammatical errors or awkward phrasings throughout.

**6. Titles and Citations**
- The “Works Cited” section is good, but, for full academic completeness, add an in-text citation format if your professor requires it (MLA style, etc.).
- For a formal academic paper, title formatting (italicizing *The Vicar of Wakefield*) and consistent punctuation matter.

This is a strong and thoughtful essay with insightful analysis and well-chosen evidence. With slight adjustments—a clearer thesis, some engagement with counterarguments or alternative interpretations, and a bit more overt attention to literary conventions of satire—it would be even more compelling.

**Score (if needed):** 85–90% (B+/A-), depending on rubric priorities

**Final Advice:** Keep pushing your interpretations further! Don’t be afraid to state your thesis boldly and anticipate alternative views. Pay attention to sentence clarity and make sure every paragraph is as direct and concise as possible.
