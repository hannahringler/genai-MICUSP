Absolutely! Below is detailed feedback on your paper, **“Stratification and Mobility of Chinese Peasant Workers.”** My feedback covers structure, clarity, argument, methodology, and minor suggestions for improvement.

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Clear Research Focus**
   - The paper has a focused research question on the stratification and mobility of Chinese peasant workers.
   - The introduction is detailed and thoroughly contextualizes the origins and transformation of the “peasant worker” (农民工) phenomenon.

2. **Theoretical Framing**
   - You present a nuanced perspective by contrasting the “low-level equilibrium trap” hypothesis with your alternative view. This drives the paper and shows critical engagement with existing literature.
   - The application of established theories (e.g., human capital, push-pull migration, low-level equilibrium trap) makes your analysis sound and grounded.

3. **Data-Driven Analysis**
   - The use of both primary (your Beijing surveys) and secondary data (national databases) is impressive and strengthens the empirical base of your arguments.
   - Preliminary findings are clearly presented, and your tables and graphs support your textual analysis well.

4. **Methodological Sophistication**
   - The proposals for regression models reflect a solid grasp of quantitative methods.
   - Your attention to key variables (e.g. education, job experience, gender, region, time periods) will allow for rich, multivariate analysis.

5. **Awareness of Limitations**
   - You recognize the difficulties of cost measurement and the limitations of only considering monetary outcomes, suggesting in-depth interviews for richer understanding.

### **Areas for Improvement and Suggestions**

#### **1. Organization and Flow**
- **Transitions:** While sections are logically ordered, some transitions are abrupt. Consider using brief summary sentences at the end of sections to bridge to the next idea.
- **Explicit Sectioning:** Use clearer section headings (e.g., “Literature Review,” “Methods,” “Findings,” “Discussion,” “Conclusion”) to guide the reader more easily through your argument.

#### **2. Clarity**
- **Language and Expression:** Some sentences are quite dense and could benefit from revision for clarity. For example:
  - *“This tremendous migration group of more than 120 million people may be encountering the most difficult upward mobility.”*
    - Try: “This large migrant group—over 120 million people—may face some of the most significant barriers to upward mobility in modern China.”
- **Definitions:** Early on, more clearly define “peasant worker.” Although you engage with Western and Chinese definitions, a concise, one-sentence definition at the start would orient readers.

#### **3. Literature Review**
- **Broader Engagement:** The literature review focuses mainly on economic and demographic studies. Briefly mention work on the social and psychological impacts of migration (e.g., family separation, identity shifts), and urban-rural policies (hukou system, rights access).
  
#### **4. Data and Methods**
- **Data Sampling:** More detail on sampling method for your pilot surveys (e.g., how did you select districts, how were respondents approached) would strengthen rigor.
- **Variable Operationalization:** When discussing models, state explicitly how you will measure key outcomes (e.g., “income” as net, gross, household, personal; “education” as years or degree).
- **Addressing Causality:** For models predicting change over time (Model 2), mention the potential for unobserved variables, or motivate why your chosen predictors are the most significant.

#### **5. Discussion and Implications**
- **Policy Implications:** The research is policy-relevant, so suggest concrete policy recommendations (e.g., reforming the hukou system, increasing rural educational opportunities).
- **Broader Relevance:** Given the size of the migrant population, briefly tie the implications for Chinese economic and social stability, modernization, or global migration patterns.

#### **6. Minor Issues**
- **References and Formatting:** Double-check references for consistency (Author, Year). If this is part of a formal proposal or journal submission, format consistently by standard (APA/Chicago).
- **Typographical Errors:** A few small typos (e.g., “emergency of peasant workers” should be “emergence”).

### **Summary**

This paper is impressive for a graduate-level research proposal: it’s ambitious, grounded in data, and thoughtfully engages with theory. Sharpening the structure and expression, clarifying your methodological details, and expanding the discussion’s implications will make the paper even stronger.

**Overall: This is a strong start to a valuable research project—your topic is significant and your proposed analysis is rigorous and thoughtfully designed.**
