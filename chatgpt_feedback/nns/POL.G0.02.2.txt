Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on your literature review, focusing both on strengths and areas for improvement:

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Thorough and Focused Literature Review**
- **Breadth & Depth**: The review covers key theories and debates on how electoral system design impacts corruption, succinctly summarizing the literature and focusing on both the Philippine and Thai cases.
- **Concept Clarification**: You carefully define important concepts (e.g., corruption, vote buying, intra- vs. inter-party competition), which helps anchor your analysis.

### 2. **Comparative Empirical Approach**
- **Use of Case Studies**: Drawing on both the Philippines and Thailand provides a comparative perspective, allowing broader implications to be drawn from specific country reforms.
- **Evidence & Data**: The use of tables and figures (party numbers, voter turnout, vote buying expenditures) is excellent, helping to visualize changes over time and supporting your analysis.

### 3. **Acknowledgment of Complexity**
- **Nuanced Argumentation**: You appropriately note the challenges of measuring corruption and the mixed results in the literature, demonstrating an understanding that institutional reform is not a panacea.

### 4. **Writing Style and Organization**
- **Structured and Logical**: The argument follows a clear structure, progressing from definition/conceptual framework to empirical cases, then to conclusions.
- **Academic Voice**: The tone is generally professional and well-suited to political science scholarship at the undergraduate level.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Thesis and Argument Clarity**
- **Specificity in Research Question**: The question, "To what extent can a country’s electoral methods temper the effects of public office corruption?" is a bit broad. Consider specifying what "temper the effects" means in practical terms (e.g., reduction in vote buying, increased party discipline, etc.).
- **Central Claim**: Your eventual conclusion is that “impact is unclear,” but the body sometimes leans toward supporting the reform argument. Consider more explicitly stating this ambivalence or drawing a more concrete interim conclusion based on your findings.

### 2. **Critical Evaluation**
- **Engagement with Disagreement**: Some works suggest PR and party-strengthening reforms reduce corruption, while others do not. Try to critically explain *why* results might differ (e.g., contextual factors, enforcement capacity, political culture).
- **Methodological Concerns**: You mention the challenge of measuring corruption, but don’t dig deeply into the *methodological shortcomings* of the cited studies or alternatives (e.g., perception-based vs. objective indicators).

### 3. **Stylistic and Minor Issues**
- **Repetition**: There is some repetition in the articulation of certain points (e.g., about intra-party competition and corruption).
- **Reference Formatting**: Citations are clear, but for a final paper, ensure consistency in your citations and that all works cited appear in a reference/bibliography section.
- **Transitions & Flow**: Occasionally, transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. Try to link sections more smoothly.

### 4. **Policy Implications**
- **Broader Lessons and Recommendations**: You discuss Thailand and the Philippines, but you could more fully explore what your findings suggest for other countries considering electoral reform.
- **Next Steps for Research**: Your suggestion about using new indicators (like school or hospital construction) is intriguing – flesh this out more, perhaps as a short “future research” section at the end.

## **Overall Assessment**

This is a strong, well-organized, and ambitious undergraduate paper. You demonstrate comprehensive engagement with relevant theories and empirical material, and your writing shows a clear grasp of scholarly standards. With sharper focus on your central argument, deeper critical engagement with the measurement issue, and some stylistic tightening, the paper would be even stronger.
