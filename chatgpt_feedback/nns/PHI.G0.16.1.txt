Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, **“Basic Frameworks of Moral Justification and Hierarchy of Human Needs.”**

---

## 1. **Thesis and Structure**

**Strengths:**
- You present a clear thesis: comparing three frameworks of moral justification (libertarianism, utilitarianism, and the hypothetical contract view) using Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.
- The structure is logical and easy to follow. You introduce the frameworks and Maslow’s ideas, analyze each philosophy across the levels of needs, and then provide an argument for your favored view (hypothetical contract), including its possible shortcomings.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider introducing, in your introduction, that you will conclude by acknowledging a limitation with your argument. This will help set expectations and reinforce the academic honesty of your approach.
- While you signal the order you will follow, reiterating the major transition points (e.g., “Now, let’s move to the third framework...”) could make the roadmap even clearer.

## 2. **Argumentation & Analysis**

**Strengths:**
- You do an excellent job of applying Maslow’s hierarchy pragmatically to each framework, showing the strengths and weaknesses of each (e.g., libertarianism’s trouble with meeting basic needs, utilitarianism’s inability to support higher needs).
- Your analogies (water drops for utilitarianism, circles for libertarianism, hands for the hypothetical contract) are effective and illustrative.
- The use of empirical examples (Great Leap Forward, “welfare queen,” reduced American civic engagement) helps ground your points.

**Suggestions:**
- The claim that libertarianism cannot meet physiological needs could use more direct support: are there historical or empirical examples where pure libertarianism failed on this level? Or is this a theoretical criticism?
- Your critique of utilitarianism risks conflating non-egalitarian and egalitarian versions; clarify whether **all** utilitarian approaches fall short or only particular interpretations.
- The application of the hypothetical contract view is strong, but at times your discussion of how it would practically balance rights and welfare is a bit vague. Adding a concrete example (perhaps a modern welfare policy) could illustrate how these balances might be struck.

## 3. **Philosophical Engagement**

**Strengths:**
- You clearly understand the core ideas of each framework and their differences regarding individual and social priorities.
- The use of Rawls (veil of ignorance, two principles of justice) is correct and relevant.

**Suggestions:**
- When discussing the veil of ignorance being “regional” rather than “universal,” you engage in an interesting revision, but this could be strengthened by referencing Rawls’s own thoughts on cultural relativism or criticism from communitarian theorists.
- The concluding limitation—that Maslow’s hierarchy is a biological not moral foundation—shows mature self-awareness, but you could even more directly ask what it would take to reconcile evolutionary and moral perspectives.

## 4. **Writing and Style**

**Strengths:**
- Your writing is clear and straightforward. The paragraphs flow logically.
- You use citations and references appropriately.

**Suggestions:**
- Proofread for minor grammar issues and awkward sentences, e.g., “the whole society is filled with these circles” might be clearer as “society, on this view, consists of these separate circles.”
- Occasionally, there are slightly wordy constructions: “In another words” should be “In other words”; “that I think most plausible” could be “which I find most plausible.”
- Some word choices are a bit imprecise, e.g., “In another words, the size of the social welfare pie will grow bigger...” It might be clearer to explain that redistribution increases total utility.

---

## 5. **Sources and Citation**

**Strengths:**
- Good use of both philosophical texts and contemporary sources.
- The references are well-documented.

**Suggestions:**
- For academic work, avoid using Wikipedia as a main source. Cite primary or authoritative secondary sources for Maslow (e.g., his original book).
- Where you rely on lecture notes, clarify what key insight they add not found in published sources.

---

## 6. **Originality and Critical Thinking**

**Strengths:**
- Your integration of Maslow with frameworks of justice is original and creative.
- Your willingness to critique your own framework at the end shows independence.

**Suggestions:**
- You could further question whether Maslow’s model is normative (describing what *should* be valued) or just descriptive (what people *do* value).
- Consider offering brief counter-arguments to your own preferred view, to show you’ve critically examined potential objections.

---

## **Summary**

**Overall, this is a strong, original, and well-structured paper.** You clearly understand the ethical frameworks and use Maslow’s hierarchy creatively to compare them. The writing is clear, though there are opportunities for more concise phrasing and minor grammatical improvements. The critique at the end, acknowledging the limitations of your own approach, is an excellent academic practice.

**To make it even better:**
- Clarify some theoretical claims with examples.
- Strengthen philosophical references and supporting evidence.
- Tighten the writing with careful proofreading.

**Grade (if required):** A- (with minor revisions, could be a solid A)
