Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, **"What Women Want: Comprehensive Contraceptive Coverage"**. I'll address your strengths, areas for improvement, and some suggestions for clarity and development.

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Thesis and Purpose**
You clearly state the main issue early on: the inconsistency and inadequacy of contraceptive coverage in the US, especially under employer-based insurance, and its impact on women’s freedom and equality. The paper firmly argues for comprehensive contraceptive coverage as a matter of rights.

### 2. **Thorough Use of Evidence**
You draw from a range of sources, including legal cases, reports, and academic articles, to back up your claims. Citations are appropriately placed, and you engage with both statistical data and policy changes (e.g., Medicaid coverage, comparison to Viagra).

### 3. **Societal and Historical Context**
The discussion of class, gender, and historical abuses (like forced sterilization) is nuanced and demonstrates awareness of broader systemic issues. Connecting past injustice to present policy arguments adds depth.

### 4. **Structure**
The essay follows a logical progression. You move from describing the problem to examining implications, to detailing attempted solutions and remaining gaps. The use of topic sentences helps guide the reader.

## Areas For Improvement

### 1. **Clarity and Conciseness**
Some paragraphs contain long, complex sentences that obscure your points. Shortening and simplifying sentences when possible will help clarity.

*Example*:  
> "When oral contraceptive pills became available, it gave women a novel means by which to take control of their sexual destiny."

Could be:  
> "The introduction of oral contraceptives gave women new control over their reproductive choices."

### 2. **Organization**
While the paper is generally well-structured, the discussion of class issues, insurance company practices, and solutions sometimes blend together. Consider tighter sectioning or signposting. For example, you might have subtitles dedicated to:  
- Historical Context & Class
- Insurance Disparities
- Gender Bias
- Recent Policy Changes
- Solutions & Call to Action

This will help readers follow your argument more easily.

---

### 3. **Use More Specific Examples**
You mention several important points (e.g., employer interest in costs, moral objections, public policies), but sometimes the claims are general. Specific case studies or striking statistics can emphasize your most important points.

*Example*:  
When discussing class disparities, you note Illinois’s employer coverage gaps. You could contrast this more effectively with a specific example from another state where mandates changed outcomes, if space allows.

---

### 4. **Counterarguments**
The mention of moral/religious objections hints at opposing viewpoints, but you could engage more directly with counterarguments. For instance, acknowledge concerns employers or religious groups may express, and offer a reasoned response.

---

### 5. **Paragraph Transitions**
Some sections (especially when moving from statistical/economic considerations to societal implications) could use smoother transitions. Summarizing the previous section and previewing the next helps maintain flow.

## Minor Notes

- There are occasional minor grammatical or typographical errors ("then" instead of "than" in "money talks more loudly then most other types of action")—watch for those in future drafts.
- Remember, the paper’s tone is largely academic and impassioned; this is great, but ensure that the conclusion’s call to action maintains a scholarly tone as well.
- When referencing statistics (e.g., "women pay 68% more"), make sure to explain why this matters for your thesis.

---

## Strong Points to Highlight

- The comparison with Viagra is particularly effective for highlighting gendered inconsistencies.
- The historical lens (sterilization and class control) gives your argument real critical depth.
- Your use of law and policy as supporting material (e.g., Equal Opportunity Commission rulings) makes the case for broader change compelling.

## Final Thoughts & Suggestions

You have written a persuasive, well-supported paper on an important issue. Focusing on tightening your organization, clarifying some prose, and engaging a bit more with counterarguments would move this from a strong undergraduate essay to an excellent one. Adding a little more specificity and varying your sentence structure for readability would help as well.

If you need, I can identify specific sentences or passages for revision, or help with a summary or restructuring plan—just let me know!

**Overall grade:** Strong A- paper with a few revisions needed for clarity and organization. **Well done!**
