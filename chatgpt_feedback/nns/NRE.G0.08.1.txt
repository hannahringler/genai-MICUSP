Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on its strengths and areas for improvement:

---

### Strengths

1. **Clear Structure and Organization**
   - The paper follows a logical progression, beginning with a summary of current issues, moving through recommendations, and ending with a conclusion. This makes it easy to follow your argument.
   - You use subheadings (“Impacts of Current Proposed Waterford Project,” “Recommendations for Community and Sustainable Development,” etc.), which help guide the reader through the content.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - The impacts of the current proposal are thoroughly discussed, including economic, social, and environmental aspects.
   - You anticipate counterarguments (e.g., the benefits of increased tax revenue and jobs) before addressing negative consequences, demonstrating balanced critical thinking.

3. **Practical, Specific Recommendations**
   - Suggestions like implementing a light rail, “Park and Ride” lots, green roofs, affordable housing linkage fees, and mixed-use zoning are concrete and grounded in smart growth principles.
   - You effectively integrate sustainability into all your recommendations.

4. **Use of Supporting Evidence**
   - References to sources such as Grengs (2008), Hall (2008), Roseland, and Cullingworth add credibility to your arguments.
   - The inclusion of a map (Figure 1) visually supports your recommendations.

5. **Attention to Equity**
   - The paper highlights social equity issues (e.g., affordable housing, accessibility), not just environmental or economic factors.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**
   - Some sentences are overly long and complex, which may detract from clarity. For instance:
     > “The unequal distribution of food and housing will widen the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged.”  
     Could be made more concise and connected to the rest of your argument.
   - Watch for redundant statements (“the city and AKA should also look at other options…”—you already detailed many options).

2. **Grammar and Word Choice**
   - There are minor grammatical errors and awkward phrases (e.g., “aesthetically please surroundings” should be “aesthetically pleasing surroundings”; “since its development exceeds the current ring of suburbs and invades the pristine forested lowlands” could be “since it extends beyond existing suburbs and encroaches on pristine forested lowlands”).
   - Proofread for run-on sentences and comma splices.

3. **Citation Format**
   - While you refer to sources, the format is inconsistent (e.g., “Roseland, pg. 49”). Consider using a consistent citation style (APA, MLA, etc.).
   - If a works cited or reference page is required, it should be included.

4. **Depth of Some Points**
   - The recommendation sections, while practical, could be stronger with examples from other cities/regions where similar strategies succeeded (cite case studies or best practices briefly).
   - More detail about how the proposed light rail, affordable housing solutions, or green roof incentives could be funded—what are the challenges and how might they be addressed?

5. **Conclusion**
   - Your conclusion restates main points, but could be more impactful with a forward-looking statement or call to action. Summarize in one or two sentences why it is especially urgent for Salitos/King County to act now.

### Minor Points

- **Map (Figure 1):** The inclusion is excellent, but be sure to reference it clearly in your text and, if submitting formally, provide a caption and proper sourcing.
- **Gender and background note:** "Female - NNS (L1: Vietnamese)" seems to be metadata; if this is meant to be anonymous, ensure only relevant information is included in formal submissions.

### Overall Assessment

Your paper is insightful, well-researched, pragmatic, and demonstrates good understanding of sustainable urban development and smart growth. With some minor refinements in writing style, citation practices, and exploration of practical implementation challenges, it could be even stronger. Well done!
