Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, addressing structure, clarity, argumentation, philosophical content, and style.

## **Overall Assessment**

Your paper tackles a deep and difficult topic at the intersection of epistemology and metaphysics—namely, the puzzle of necessary/a posteriori and contingent/a priori truths, as raised by Kripke, and attempts to analyze them via Stalnaker’s two-dimensional semantic apparatus. The engagement with both Kripke and Stalnaker is thoughtful, and your analysis raises a genuine philosophical puzzle, which is an excellent approach for a research paper.

## **Strengths**

1. **Ambitious Topic**
   - You tackle a sophisticated and subtle debate that is central to 20th-century analytic philosophy. The paper demonstrates familiarity with foundational texts and a willingness to engage with technical material.

2. **Good Use of Examples**
   - You work through classic examples such as "The standard meter is one meter long" and "Gold has atomic number 79," which grounds your argument and makes the abstract discussion more accessible.

3. **Critical Engagement**
   - Rather than simply reporting on views, you critically examine whether the two-dimensional apparatus can accommodate the existence of necessary a posteriori or contingent a priori truths—a genuine philosophical challenge.

4. **Structure**
   - The paper is generally well organized: starting with an introduction, running through technical explanations, then applying them to key cases, and wrapping up with a conclusion and references.

## **Areas for Improvement and Specific Feedback**

### 1. **Clarity and Exposition**

- **Conceptual Density**
  - Some sections are dense, and the transitions between technical points and philosophical argument could be smoother. Try to break technical explanations down further and clarify why each step matters in your overall argument.
- **Terminology**
  - The introduction and technical sections introduce many abbreviations and terms (w, P, PC, SP, CS, A, B, ‘dagA’, etc.). While necessary for precision, a summary “cheat sheet” or a glossary/table at the end or in a footnote could help readers.
- **Explanation of the Two-Dimensional Matrix**
  - The explanation of the diagonal and horizontal propositions might be clearer if accompanied by labeled tables or diagrams. Ensure readers can visually track which row/column is which (context vs. world of evaluation).

### 2. **Argumentation and Philosophical Content**

- **Identification of Propositions**
  - Your main claim is that the two-dimensional framework struggles to make clear sense of the very “truths” Kripke detects (necessary a posteriori, contingent a priori). However, you should spell out more clearly why the diagonal does *not* capture what Kripke wants (rather than just stating it and moving on). Would Kripke accept your premise about the "proposition expressed"? Are you assuming a strongly Millian or Fregean view?
- **Alternative Interpretations**
  - You raise the problem, but you could more fully discuss alternatives. For instance, some philosophers argue that what is “known a priori/necessary” vs. “a posteriori/contingent” tracks different sorts of meaning—semantic content vs. epistemic intension (cf. David Chalmers’ work). A brief engagement with this might strengthen your conclusion.
- **Revising Tenet (i)**
  - The suggestion to revise tenet (i) at the end (distinguishing "what is said, expressed and known") is promising but deserves elaboration. How would this distinction help? Perhaps sketch what sorts of distinctions (e.g., Fregean sense/reference, Chalmers' two-dimensionalism) you have in mind.

### 3. **Style and Presentation**

- **Language**
  - The writing is generally lucid but sometimes informal for a philosophical paper (“if not, you should read back again”; “there are no free lunches in philosophy”). Slightly more formal phrasing (e.g., “One might object that...”) is recommended.
- **Footnotes**
  - Footnotes are used well, but make sure references are always clear and relevant to the main text.
- **References**
  - Good that you include the key sources, but if space allows, consider adding work that directly discusses two-dimensional semantics and the Kripkean puzzles (e.g., Chalmers, Jackson).

### 4. **Technical Aspects**

- **Formal Tables**
  - The “A” and “B” matrices could be labeled and laid out more explicitly. Indicate which rows/columns represent which variables and why they matter for contingency and necessity.
- **Proofreading**
  - Minor typos and small errors appear occasionally (“her intention to get the hearer to believe in what is asserted”; “whether this standpoint helps us finding out...” should be “helps us find out...”). Proofread for minor slips.

## **Suggestions for Revision**

- **Clarify** at the outset why the difference between necessary a posteriori and contingent a priori matters philosophically, beyond being paradoxical.
- **Smooth out** your technical exposition and tie it more tightly to the philosophical problem. After each technical point, explicitly state why it helps (or fails to help) resolve the puzzle.
- **Expand** briefly (if possible) on how other philosophers (e.g., Chalmers, Jackson, Davies) have handled these puzzles with two-dimensional semantics, and set your argument in dialogue with them.
- **Elaborate** at the end on your suggested solution: what might a more nuanced view of “what is said” look like, and how would it directly address the puzzle?
- **Polish** writing for formal tone, clarity, and to remove minor grammatical errors.

## **Conclusion**

This is a solid, ambitious, and very promising graduate paper. With a bit more clarification, connection both to the existing literature and to possible solutions, and with tightened prose, it could be an excellent contribution to a seminar or proseminar discussion. Your understanding of the philosophical terrain is evident, and you’re not afraid to take a stand on a genuine puzzle.

**Keep refining your technical explanations, be bold in your criticisms, and elaborate more on possible solutions—your instincts are very good!**
