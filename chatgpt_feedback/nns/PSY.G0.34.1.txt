Certainly! Here is some detailed feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, structure, and overall clarity:

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive Comparison:**  
   The paper provides a thorough comparison between the John/Joan case study and Milgram’s obedience experiments, analyzing both methodological and ethical dimensions.

2. **Use of Sources:**  
   The writer references a good variety of relevant sources, including key studies and ethical guidelines, which supports the arguments and demonstrates research effort.

3. **Critical Thinking:**  
   There is evidence of critical analysis, not just summarizing information but evaluating the limitations in methodology (e.g., replication, generalizability) and ethical concerns.

4. **Attention to Ethical Standards:**  
   The paper does a good job connecting both studies back to specific APA ethical guidelines, using concrete examples to judge compliance.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Organization and Structure:**
   - **Transitions:** The paper sometimes jumps between topics abruptly. Adding more transition sentences between sections would help the flow.
   - **Subheadings:** Consider adding subheadings for sections like "Replication and Reliability", "Generalizability", "Ethical Concerns (Deception, Consent, Harm, Privacy)" to guide the reader.

2. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - Some sentences are quite long and could be delivered more clearly if broken up.
   - Occasional repetition (e.g., points about replication and generalizability are restated in several places) could be trimmed for brevity.

3. **Depth of Analysis:**
   - While the paper critiques both studies, the analysis of Milgram's research is more nuanced than the John/Joan case. It might benefit from a deeper exploration of why Money’s work continued to be influential despite methodological flaws, or more discussion on the long-term repercussions for intersex children.

4. **Evidence and Examples:**
   - In a few instances, assertions could be backed up with more details or quotes from the case studies (especially direct evidence of harm or lack of consent in Money’s work).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The paper would benefit from a stronger concluding paragraph that summarizes the main findings and offers a final reflection on the importance of both methodological rigor and ethical standards in psychological research.

**Minor Issues:**

- **Citations:** Make sure all claims and facts are cited appropriately. In some places, sources are mentioned in passing—use proper in-text citation format consistently.
- **Grammar:** There are minor grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, punctuation), but nothing that seriously hampers comprehension.

**Sample Improved Paragraph with Transitions and Clarity:**

*Original:*  
“Replication could have shown that the John/Joan case study was not proof that children are born psychosexually undifferentiated (Colapinto, 1997). Replication would also have corrected for other apparent flaws in the study. One such flaw was Janet Reimer’s apparent social desirability bias as she would only seize on ‘moments that Joan’s behavior could be construed as stereotypically feminine’ when writing to Money about Joan’s progress (Colapinto, 1997).”

*Revised:*  
“If other researchers had attempted to replicate the John/Joan case, they might have demonstrated that it was not reliable evidence for the hypothesis that children are born psychosexually undifferentiated (Colapinto, 1997). Moreover, replication would have helped address additional issues, such as social desirability bias. For example, Janet Reimer, when communicating with Money, tended to highlight only those behaviors in Joan that could be interpreted as stereotypically feminine, potentially skewing the reported outcomes (Colapinto, 1997).”

---

**Overall Assessment:**  
This paper demonstrates a good understanding of both the John/Joan case and Milgram's obedience studies, as well as ethical research standards. With improved organization, more balanced depth of analysis on both cases, and a clearer conclusion, it would be even stronger. The writer’s critical perspective is a definite asset—keep developing this with focused, concise writing and strong structure.

**Grade Estimate:**  
Depending on rubric specifics, this paper would likely score in the B to A- range at the undergraduate level, with potential for a higher grade after revisions.
