## **Strengths**

### **1. Clear Introduction and Rationale**
- The introduction is thorough, providing good background on learning, fear responses, and the relevance of classical conditioning in biopsychology.
- The transition from general concepts (e.g., survival advantages of fear) to specific mechanisms (the amygdala and NMDA receptors) is logical and well-explained.
- The study’s significance—both basic science and clinical relevance—is clearly established.

### **2. Detailed Methods**
- The methods section is impressively detailed. It describes the subjects, stimuli, surgical procedures, and drug infusion steps thoroughly enough for replication.
- Pre-training, training, and post-training procedures are logically laid out with an appropriate experimental timeline.

### **3. Results**
- Results are explained clearly in narrative and with quantified data (percentages), which are helpfully compared across conditions/groups.
- Behavioral data is segmented well (freezing, grooming, rearing, locomotion), reflecting a comprehensive analysis.
- The inclusion of graphs/figures enhances the accessibility of the data and facilitates interpretation.

### **4. Thoughtful Discussion**
- The discussion is reflective and not simply a repetition of the results. It connects experimental outcomes to the prior literature and theoretical background.
- Limitations and alternative explanations are addressed candidly (e.g., memory duration, sample size, protocol follow-through).
- The paper offers sensible suggestions for future research and modifications to improve validity.

### **5. Use of References**
- References are appropriate and up-to-date (at time of writing), anchoring the work in reputable scientific literature.

## **Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

### **1. Organization and Flow**
- **Paragraphing:** Long paragraphs, especially in the introduction and methods, could be split for improved readability.
- **Transitions:** Occasionally, transitions between sections (e.g., into Results or when shifting between behaviors) can be abrupt. Adding brief "roadmap" or transition sentences could help.

### **2. Sample Size and Design**
- Only two subjects per group is very small and considerably limits valid statistical inference or generalizability. This is acknowledged in the discussion, but should be emphasized as a critical limitation early in the methods/results.
- If possible, include justification for the sample size (power analysis, logistical constraints, etc.), or explicitly recognize this as a pilot/feasibility study.

### **3. Statistical Analysis**
- **Missing Statistical Tests:** No statistical analyses (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) or p-values are reported—these are standard in behavioral research for determining whether observed differences are significant.
    - Suggestion: Even with a small n, basic descriptive statistics plus clear acknowledgment of the limitations in detecting significance would strengthen the paper.

### **4. Data Presentation and Figures**
- The figures are clear, but axes, error bars, and group labeling (beyond just color) could be better clarified (e.g., "APV" and "SAL" could be defined in figure legends).
- Inclusion of a table summarizing all results might help synthesize the behavioral data across all measures/timepoints.

### **5. Clarity and Style**
- **Defining Terms:** Some terms are defined but could be clarified earlier or more prominently for readers less familiar with behavioral neuroscience (e.g., "freezing behavior").
- **Grammar/Word Choice:** The paper is generally well-written, but a few sentences are complex or could be simplified for clarity (e.g., “the mechanism by which a fear response is acquired and expressed…” can be rephrased for directness).
- **Objectivity:** Occasionally the wording is casual (“we found some of the information to be expected…”). Strive for a more formal academic register: “The results were generally consistent with the hypothesis…”

### **6. Literature and Theory**
- While the theory is well-covered, additional studies supporting the role of NMDA receptors in LTP and memory outside the referenced Maren et al., 1996, would add depth.
- The discussion might benefit from connecting findings more explicitly to clinical parallels (e.g., what it could mean for understanding PTSD or phobias in humans).

## **Summary Feedback**
**Overall, this is a strong undergraduate research paper that demonstrates a good grasp of experimental design in behavioral neuroscience, with meticulous methods and thoughtful analysis. Improved statistical treatment, deeper literature integration, and a slightly more formal tone would make this paper even stronger and more suitable for higher-level publication or professional presentation.**
