Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on structure, clarity, analysis, and overall effectiveness. I will also note your strengths and make some suggestions for improvement.

## **Overall Impression**
Your paper demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of complex social theory and does an excellent job mapping out the conceptual networks that shape Polanyi, Arendt, and Habermas. The engagement with primary and secondary sources shows depth and breadth. However, some sections could benefit from greater clarity, more explicit transitions, and tighter focus on your comparative analysis.

## **Strengths**

### **1. Ambitious Scope**
You tackle important theorists (Polanyi, Arendt, Habermas) and effectively contextualize their thought within larger intellectual traditions, particularly that of utilitarian and liberal social theory. This is impressive and shows strong academic ambition.

### **2. Theoretical Sophistication**
You are clearly well-versed in the ideas and debates you're discussing, e.g., the significance of the public/private divide, "social naturalism," and the "dichotomy" in modern politics. Your references to both primary texts and critical commentary (Somers, Benhabib, Calhoun, Alexander) are apt and well-chosen.

### **3. Critical Engagement**
The critiques of each theorist are fair and insightful. For instance, your analysis of Habermas’ limitations (his residual privileging of the private side) draws on Somers in an intelligent way.

### **4. Use of Citations**
You make detailed use of cited sources, with specific page numbers, which grounds your analysis in the existing scholarship.

## **Areas for Improvement and Suggestions**

### **1. Organization and Signposting**
- **Structure:** The paper sometimes moves abruptly from one theorist to another, which can leave the reader confused about the logical flow. Consider using clearer section headings or stronger topic sentences to indicate when you are shifting focus.
- **Transitions:** For example, when you move from Polanyi to Arendt, and then to Habermas, explicitly mark these transitions (e.g., "Having examined Polanyi’s critique of economic liberalism, I now turn to Arendt’s challenge to liberal conceptions of rights...").

### **2. Clarity and Conciseness**
- Some sentences are overly long or packed with technical concepts, which might obscure your point for readers who are less familiar with the material. For example, the sentence "Distinct from utilitarian and liberal tradition’s dividing the society into two realms: state and anti-state, Polanyi takes a holistic view on the society" could be rephrased for clarity ("Whereas utilitarian and liberal thinkers divide society sharply between state and anti-state, Polanyi adopts a more holistic, integrated view").
- Watch for grammatical slips and awkward phrasings that can make reading less smooth. As in: “Polanyi believes the economy was not a matter of economics but a question of a moral construction of social relation generally.” Consider: “Polanyi argues that the economy is best understood not as an autonomous domain, but as embedded in the moral fabric of social relations.”

### **3. Depth versus Breadth**
- At times, the paper summarizes the positions of the three theorists somewhat schematically. It would be good to delve more deeply into one or two key concepts for each, rather than trying to cover every possible angle. For example, for Polanyi, focus more specifically on "embeddedness" or “the double movement.”
- You might bring in more of your own evaluative voice: e.g., are Polanyi or Arendt more successful in escaping liberal naturalism, in your view? What are the broader implications of this for contemporary social theory?

### **4. Comparative Synthesis**
- The conclusion is somewhat implicit. Consider explicitly synthesizing your discussion by drawing connections and distinctions between the thinkers. What do we learn about the legacy of liberalism from examining all three? How do their critiques and solutions interact or diverge?

### **5. Stylistic and Formatting Points**
- Try to use the theorists’ names consistently (Arendt, not “Adrendt”).
- Double-check for small typos (e.g., “notion-states” should be “nation-states”).
- When making complex arguments, break up long paragraphs to ensure each idea is clearly articulated.

## **Summary**

**This is a strong and ambitious graduate-level paper** with a clear command of the literature, original insights, and a well-chosen theoretical lens. To push it to the next level:
- Work on smoothing transitions and clarifying your prose.
- Deepen your comparative analysis, especially in the conclusion.
- Clarify your own critical stance in relation to the theorists.
