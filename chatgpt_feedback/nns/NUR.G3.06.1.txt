Absolutely! Here’s a detailed **feedback** on your research protocol “Strategies Pakistani Women Use to Self-Manage their Recurrent Depression”:

---

### Strengths

**1. Well-Defined Purpose and Research Questions**
- The research purpose and objectives are clearly outlined at the beginning.
- The focus on Pakistani women, recurrent depression, and the cultural context is well-justified.

**2. Comprehensive Methodology**
- The qualitative content analysis approach is appropriate for exploring lived experiences and subjective perspectives.
- Purposeful sampling is explained clearly, as is the rationale for saturation.

**3. Thorough Participant Consideration**
- The inclusion and exclusion criteria are comprehensive and address important confounding variables (e.g., excluding bipolar disorder, substance abuse).
- Special provisions for participants with literacy challenges are thoughtful and inclusive.

**4. Strong Human Subjects Protection**
- Well-articulated consent procedures (including verbal consent for non-literate participants).
- Thorough confidentiality protocols and sensitivity to participant wellbeing (e.g., managing distress, suicide risk protocols).

**5. Data Collection and Analysis Clarity**
- The interview guide and process for translation and analysis are explained step by step.
- The borrowed and emergent categories are well-conceptualized, and reliability/validity are addressed using established qualitative principles.

**6. Transparency and Ethics**
- IRB and ethical reviews are noted.
- Consideration of payment, voluntary participation, and participant rights is clear and appropriate.

**7. Appendices and Documentation**
- The inclusion of participant forms, interview guide, and category tables adds to the transparency and reproducibility of the study.

### Areas for Improvement / Suggestions

**1. Sample Size Justification**
- While qualitative studies rely on saturation, giving a more explicit estimate based on previous studies or preliminary data would enhance rigor.

**2. Reflexivity**
- As the researcher has clinical experience with the population, adding a reflexivity statement about your own positionality, assumptions, and strategies to minimize bias would strengthen credibility.

**3. Data Translation Process**
- Consider providing more detail on how you will ensure the **accuracy and cultural sensitivity** of the translation process, especially for nuanced concepts in mental health.

**4. Interview Guide**
- While broad and specific questions are listed, sharing a sample set of potential probes or follow-ups in the appendix could add clarity.

**5. Limitations Section**
- Some limitations are mentioned (e.g., literacy and access for self-referred participants), but a separate, succinct limitations section could enhance transparency (e.g., single site, reliance on self-report, cultural factors, etc.).

**6. Data Analysis Software**
- If you are not planning to use software, briefly address why (e.g., sample size manageable by hand), or note the potential advantages if you decide to use it later.

**7. Focus on Diversity**
- The protocol notes inclusion of all ethnic groups, but consider discussing how ethnic, linguistic, or regional diversity within the Pakistani sample will be considered or reported (if relevant to the aims).

**8. Timeline and Feasibility**
- The data collection window is specified, but consider expanding on timelines for analysis/writing, and potential risks to timeline.

**9. Impact and Dissemination**
- You address potential benefits to participants and providers. Consider specifying plans to disseminate findings to community stakeholders, clinics, or participants beyond academic publication.

**10. Language Polishing**
- The protocol is clear and readable, but could benefit from a brief proofreading for minor grammatical improvements.

### Overall Assessment

This is a **strong, ethically rigorous, and well-constructed qualitative research protocol** that is positioned to make a meaningful contribution to understanding mental health strategies among Pakistani women. The emphasis on participant protections and cultural context is especially noteworthy.

By refining a few structural and reflexive aspects, and expanding on certain sections, your study will be even more robust and credible.

**Excellent work!**
