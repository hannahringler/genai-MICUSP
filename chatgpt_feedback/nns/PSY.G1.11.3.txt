Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your proposal, covering strengths and areas for improvement:

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clarity of Purpose and Objectives**
- The objectives and research questions are well articulated, aligning clearly with current gaps in the literature.
- The focus on moderating factors such as cultural values, acculturation, and bicultural identity is timely and relevant.

### 2. **Theoretical Grounding**
- You provide a strong theoretical justification, drawing upon key research and statistics to highlight the importance of mental health in poor Latino adolescents.
- Cited literature is relevant and helps frame your argument about the need to explore cultural moderators in psychological well-being.

### 3. **Attention to Diversity**
- Your discussion of diversity among Latino populations and attention to the specific context of Dominican adolescents demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the population studied.

### 4. **Methodological Strengths**
- The use of both quantitative and qualitative methods is a strength, as it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of well-being in this context.
- Participation in an established study (“The Latino Family Study”) provides credibility and feasibility to your data collection plans.

### 5. **Budget and Timeline**
- The budget is clearly broken down and justified. 
- The timeline for data collection, analysis, and thesis completion is realistic and well-aligned with your degree requirements.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. **Literature Review/Background**
- While your literature review is strong, it could be more organized. Consider using subheadings or clearer transitions between major points (e.g., “Gender differences,” “Role of acculturation,” “Protective factors”).
- Explicitly address a few more recent studies if possible, to ensure up-to-date context as some references are from the early 2000s.

### 2. **Rationale for Focusing on Dominican Adolescents**
- You mention this sample is largely Dominican, which is excellent for specificity. However, elaborate more on what makes this group unique (e.g., how their migration history, cultural practices, or community context may differ from Mexican or Puerto Rican youth).

### 3. **Operationalization of Key Variables**
- Provide more detailed information on how each variable will be measured (e.g., which established scales will you use for “psychological well-being,” “acculturation,” “familismo,” etc.).
- Consider adding brief rationales for your choice of instruments or including examples of survey items.

### 4. **Data Analysis Plan**
- Briefly outline your proposed method of analysis. For instance: what statistical procedures will you use to assess moderation (e.g., regression analyses, interaction terms)? How will you analyze the qualitative interviews (e.g., thematic analysis, coding strategies)?

### 5. **Ethical Considerations**
- While referenced indirectly, a few sentences about how you will protect participant confidentiality, manage informed consent, and handle sensitive data would strengthen your proposal.

### 6. **Language and Formatting**
- Consider refining the writing for conciseness—occasionally sentences are quite long and could be clarified.
- Make sure terms (e.g., “bicultural identity,” “marianismo”) are defined clearly when first mentioned.
- Use a consistent citation style throughout, according to APA guidelines if applicable.

## Summary

**Overall, your proposal demonstrates strong research skills, cultural sensitivity, and a clear plan for scholarly contribution. With some further clarification of methods, sharpening of literature coverage, and organization, this paper will be a compelling Master's thesis proposal.**
