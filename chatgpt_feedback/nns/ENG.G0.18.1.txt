Certainly! Below is a thorough feedback on the essay "Individuality and Isolation in Defoe’s Moll Flanders." I’ll address key areas: thesis/argument, use of evidence, structure and organization, analysis, style, and areas for improvement.

---

**Overall Assessment**

This essay provides a thoughtful and perceptive analysis of Daniel Defoe's *Moll Flanders*, examining the complex interplay between individuality, gender roles, and isolation in the titular character. The author demonstrates a solid understanding of historical context and textual nuance, particularly in the discussion of Moll's "masculinity" and her defiance of contemporary feminine norms.

### Strengths

**1. Clear Central Argument**
- The essay’s thesis is explicit: Moll’s individuality and her defiance of traditional female roles set her apart, but this also results in profound social and psychological isolation. The writer consistently engages with this central idea.

**2. Contextual Awareness**
- The historical context regarding gender roles in the 18th century is effectively established. Linking Moll’s behavior to the "first cinders of feminism" demonstrates awareness of both literary context and broader social trends.

**3. Close Reading and Evidence**
- The essay uses well-chosen textual evidence, including direct quotations from the novel, to support its claims. For instance, the discussion around Moll’s abandonment of her children and the analysis of her relationships with the gentry family and the governess are supported by specific references.

**4. Analytical Depth**
- The writer moves beyond summary to interrogate the *meaning* of Moll’s actions. The distinction between learning by "imitation and enquiry" versus "instruction and direction" is a particularly insightful point.

**5. Focus on Ambiguity**
- The conclusion insightfully notes that Moll’s return to a more stable family structure does not negate the novel’s broader commentary on the necessity—and costs—of female agency and isolation.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Organization and Flow**
- At times, the argument could benefit from clearer topic sentences and transitions. The essay occasionally jumps between ideas (e.g., from Moll’s learning in childhood to her relationship with her children) in a way that interrupts the logical flow.
    - *Suggestion:* Consider using transition phrases to clarify how each paragraph develops the thesis or relates to previous points.

**2. Engagement with Counterarguments or Nuance**
- The essay presents Moll’s lack of maternal instinct as largely negative or as a cost of individualism. There’s room for exploring whether Defoe, or contemporary readers, might view this differently, or whether certain moments in the text challenge the essay’s thesis.
    - *Suggestion:* Briefly address whether Moll’s isolation is portrayed entirely negatively, or whether Defoe sees value in her independence.

**3. Depth of Psychological Analysis**
- While the essay notes the lack of "psychological probing" in the text, this point could be sharpened. There’s mention of Moll being a stranger to both characters and readers, but this could be developed further, perhaps by situating *Moll Flanders* within debates about the rise of the novel and the representation of interiority.
    - *Suggestion:* Reference scholarship on the development of characterization and psychology in early novels to strengthen this point.

**4. Stylistic Refinement**
- The writing is competent and generally clear, but there are some awkward phrases and run-on sentences (e.g., “This recurring masculinity in the portrayal of Moll’s character suggests a woman of a new era; the 1800s become an era in which the first cinders of feminism are kindled.”). Be wary of wordiness.
    - *Suggestion:* Proofread for conciseness and clarity; split longer sentences if necessary.

**5. Formatting and Citations**
- The essay uses in-text citations (page numbers), which is good, but if submitted for a class, ensure it matches the required format (e.g., MLA, APA). The works cited entry is appropriate, but you may wish to remove the “Michigan Corpus…” at the bottom if unintended.

**6. Secondary Sources**
- The analysis would be elevated by at least brief reference to secondary sources or scholarship, especially when making claims about gender roles or individualism in the period.

### Summary of Recommendations

- **Sharpen your organization and transitions** to help the argument flow more naturally.
- **Explore moments of complexity**—was Moll’s isolation only negative? How does the novel position the reader vis-à-vis Moll?
- **Deepen your discussion** of the novel’s psychological dynamics by connecting to larger literary debates.
- **Polish your style and clarity** with another round of editing.
- **Integrate or gesture toward secondary criticism** to reinforce key claims.

**Final Thoughts**

This is a strong undergraduate essay that shows real thoughtfulness and engagement with Defoe’s work. By refining focus and further developing its analysis, it could become an excellent piece of literary criticism. Well done!
