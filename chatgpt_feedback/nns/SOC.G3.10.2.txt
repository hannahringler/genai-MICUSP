Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on the paper "Goffman and Butler: two complementary approaches for understanding a queer social interaction." I’ll address clarity, structure, argumentation, use of sources, and offer suggestions for improvement.

**Strengths**

1. **Clear Focus and Purpose**
   - The paper presents a focused comparison between Goffman and Butler, clearly framing the discussion around a concrete example of a queer social interaction. The opening scenario is memorable and effective.

2. **Balanced Theoretical Synthesis**
   - You skillfully move between Goffman and Butler, explaining each theorist’s approach in enough detail for a reader to follow, and you make thoughtful connections between their frameworks.

3. **Insightful Discussion of Cultural and Social Change**
   - The final sections demonstrate real insight, especially in considering not just how terms like "queer" are resignified, but also the broader conditions for that resignification.

4. **Good Use of Direct Quotes and References**
   - Key phrases and concepts are well supported by quotations, and the reference section is clear and complete.

**Areas for Improvement**

1. **Clarity and Organization**
   - While the paper’s structure is logical, some sections could benefit from clearer signposting and transitions. Occasionally, the writing becomes dense, especially when shifting from summary to analysis (e.g., the movement from describing Goffman’s concepts to discussing their implications for cultural change).
   - Consider briefly previewing your overall argument in the introduction. For instance, state up front that the paper will show how Goffman's and Butler's theories together illuminate the interplay between social interaction and cultural meaning-making.

2. **Depth and Specificity in Comparison**
   - At points, you state that Goffman provides a mechanism for meaning change at the micro-level, while Butler gives macro-level context, but this crucial insight sometimes gets lost in summary. Try to foreground comparison and synthesis more explicitly: How do these two theories fill each other's gaps? Where do they potentially disagree?

3. **Engagement with Counterarguments**
   - The strongest academic writing acknowledges possible objections or limitations. For example, you note that Goffman’s framework is fairly static, but could expand: Are there newer readings or criticisms of Goffman that might call this into question? Similarly, are there limits to Butler’s emphasis on linguistics and performance in accounting for lived experience or material inequalities?

4. **Writing Style**
   - Mostly clear and academic, but some sentences are quite long or convoluted. Breaking them up would improve readability. For example:
     > "In fact, he seems to consider this an obvious prerequisite for implementing face-work, and does not give it much more consideration (13)."
     Could become:  
     > "In fact, he seems to treat this understanding as a given—a prerequisite for implementing face-work—and thus does not address it further."

5. **Concrete Examples**
   - The analysis could benefit from occasional additional concrete or historical examples (beyond Butler’s and Goffman’s original texts) to illustrate your points about resignification or face-work in action, especially for readers less familiar with the source material.

6. **Conclusion**
   - The conclusion appropriately synthesizes your main ideas, but could more forcefully state what is at stake. Why does this theoretical synthesis matter beyond the classroom? What can it teach activists, policymakers, or other scholars?

**Final Comments**

This is a strong, thoughtful, and well-organized paper showing excellent understanding of both Goffman and Butler. With improved emphasis on direct comparison, more reader-friendly organization, and the addition of concrete cases and counterpoints, it would become even more effective and engaging. Well done!
