Absolutely! Here is a detailed review and feedback on your paper on Frege's "On Sense and Reference," considering strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions for further development:

---

### Strengths

**1. Deep Engagement with the Text**
- Your paper demonstrates a thorough reading of Frege’s essay. You grapple seriously with his central arguments (the sense-reference distinction, the puzzle of identity statements, the reference of sentences).

**2. Clear Structure**
- The paper is logically organized, moving from an overview of Frege's framework to more specific discussions about sentence reference and subordinate clauses. Each section builds on the previous, making your paper easy to follow.

**3. Critical Reflection**
- You do not just summarize Frege's ideas; you critically interrogate them (e.g., questioning the legitimacy and consistency of the reference of sentences). You also raise original questions about unexamined aspects, such as the reference of verbs/adjectives.

**4. Awareness of Broader Context**
- You reference other major figures (e.g., Bloomfield), showing that you understand Frege within the context of linguistic and philosophical theory more broadly.

**5. Nuanced Distinctions**
- Your discussion of different types of subordinate clauses and truth values is careful and precise, and you recognize complexities in how Frege treats indirect speech, quotation, and command/request structures.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Language and Clarity**
- Some sentences are somewhat awkward or could be expressed more clearly, which may be due, in part, to writing in a second language. For example: “Frege is an enthusiastic formalist who had been pursuing an ideal language...” could be more directly “Frege pursued an ideal language as a committed formalist...”
- Occasional grammatical and lexical inaccuracies (e.g., “inaccountability,” “incllarification,” “miss-targeted,” “reduplicated”) distract from your arguments.

**2. Definition and Consistency**
- While you mention Frege’s lack of formal definitions for "sense" and "reference," your own explanations could sometimes be clearer. Try to state explicitly what you take these terms to mean before analyzing further complexities or inconsistencies.
- Be careful with terms like “reference,” “sense,” “truth value,” etc.—sometimes their use gets blurred (which, ironically, you also critique in Frege!).

**3. Depth of Analysis**
- While you critically question Frege's assumptions about the reference of sentences, the counterarguments could be developed further. For example, you question whether we need to suppose that sentences have reference, but could bring in additional support from later semantic theorists (e.g., Tarski, Davidson) to either bolster or nuance this critique.

**4. Strength of Critique**
- Some of your more critical points (e.g., that Frege is inconsistent about reference in subordinate clauses, or that the reference of sentences is “ungrounded”) could be strengthened with more evidence or alternative perspectives. Where you disagree, explain in more detail why, or what the consequences would be for Frege’s overall theory.

**5. Stylistic/Structural Concerns**
- The paper sometimes introduces questions or objections without fully resolving them before moving on. Consider more explicitly stating your conclusion or judgment at each stage—for example, noting exactly how you think Frege succeeds or fails, and why this matters.
- Reference to your own previous paper (on Bloomfield) is fine, but consider if it’s necessary to the argument—if included, make sure it's fully related to your current topic.

### Suggestions for Further Development

1. **Explicit Thesis:** Early in the paper, state explicitly what your main argument will be: Is it primarily that Frege is inconsistent, or that his theory cannot be coherently extended to the reference of sentences, or something else?

2. **Engagement with Literature:** You briefly reference Bloomfield and cite modern philosophy of language sources. You could further support your discussion by incorporating more recent or alternative views on sentence reference (e.g., referential/attributive distinction, possible worlds semantics).

3. **Examples:** Your paper deals with fairly abstract points. Concrete, original examples could help clarify your criticisms or alternatives.

4. **Final Assessment:** The conclusion could be more assertive. Do you think Frege’s project ultimately fails to deal with sentence reference? Or is it fruitful despite the inconsistencies?

### Example of a Revised Paragraph

**Original**:
> "Actually we do not think there is much sense talking about whether replacing the clause with another sentence of the same truth value can retain the truth value of the whole sentence. Replacing the clause with another sentence, even if it is of the same truth value, will distort the thought of the whole sentence. If we follow Frege’s proposal that truth values comes from the judgement of the thought, we will see making effort on this topic is going a bit far away."

**Suggested Revision**:
> "In fact, the question of whether substituting a subordinate clause with another of the same truth value preserves the truth value of the entire sentence may be misguided. Even if the substituted clause has the same truth value, it could radically alter the thought, or cognitive content, expressed by the whole sentence. Given Frege's claim that truth value arises from the judgment of a thought, it seems misplaced to focus primarily on reference without considering the underlying sense that gives rise to truth value in the first place."

## Final Comments

This paper is a thoughtful and serious engagement with a foundational text in semantics and the philosophy of language. With more attention to clarity of expression, a tighter focus on your main critical points, and a stronger conclusion, it could become an excellent critical review suitable for an upper-level graduate seminar or publication.
