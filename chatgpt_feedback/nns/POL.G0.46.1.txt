Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, “The Difficulty With International Law During the War on Terror,” with comments on structure, content, analysis, style, strengths, and suggestions for improvement.

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Clear Organization & Structure**
   - Your paper has a logical flow: introduction of the problem, presentation and comparison of the main authors’ arguments, and a thoughtful conclusion.
   - You provide context before delving into analysis, helping readers unfamiliar with the topic.

2. **Engagement with Sources**
   - You utilize a variety of academic and journalistic sources, referencing key thinkers (Sofaer, Roth, Yoo, and others) to support your arguments, which adds credibility.

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - The comparison between Sofaer’s and Roth’s positions (as well as Yoo/Delahunty and others) is insightful, demonstrating your ability to synthesize opposing views and highlight nuance.

4. **Clarity on Key Problems**
   - You explain well the ambiguity in international law terminology, especially regarding the definition and treatment of “terrorism,” and demonstrate why this poses practical and ethical dilemmas.

5. **Real-World Application**
   - There’s a strong connection between theoretical debates and real policy examples (e.g., Guantanamo Bay, U.S. policy shifts), which grounds your analysis in reality.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### **1. Thesis & Argumentation**

- **Thesis Clarity:**
  - Your introduction outlines the problem and points toward the need for reform, but your thesis could be sharper. Consider stating explicitly, in one or two sentences, your main position regarding international law’s limitations and possible solutions.

#### **2. Depth of Analysis**

- **Critical Engagement:**
  - You summarize sources well but could engage more critically. For example, after presenting an author's argument, ask: _Are there counterexamples? Do you agree or disagree, and why?_
  - When you mention, “Sofaer criticizes the law itself, Roth criticizes its abuse,” it would deepen the analysis to give your assessment of which critique is more compelling, and under what circumstances.

#### **3. Language & Style**

- **Conciseness:**
  - Some sentences are longer than necessary, diminishing their impact. Shorter, more direct sentences can strengthen your points.
  - Example: “…in reality, the acceptance of terror is far more widespread around the world as many nations regard terrorism as a legitimate means of warfare.” — Consider rephrasing for clarity, e.g. “However, many nations view certain acts of terrorism as legitimate warfare, broadening its acceptance globally.”

- **Tone:**
  - Generally academic but occasionally drifts toward conversational. Maintain a consistent, formal academic tone throughout.

#### **4. Use of Evidence & Citation**

- **Quote Integration:**
  - Some in-text citations (e.g., “Sofaer, 901”) are a bit abrupt. Try embedding quotes or evidence more seamlessly into your own analysis.
  - Provide more context before or after quotes to help the reader understand their significance.

- **Page Numbers:**
  - While citing page numbers is good, establish whether you’re paraphrasing or quoting directly.

#### **5. Conclusions & Recommendations**

- **Original Contributions:**
  - Your suggestions for reforming international law (such as amending the Geneva Conventions) are strong. Consider expanding on how feasible these reforms are, and what obstacles might arise beyond “it seems highly improbable.”
  - Offer a clear, final insight or recommendation in your conclusion—what’s the most urgent or achievable step forward?

#### **6. Minor Editorial Points**

- **Proofreading:**
  - Watch for minor grammatical errors (“laws will remain diminish and additional conflict will arise” should be “laws will remain diminished, and…”).
  - Check for typos and repeated words (e.g., “multi-lateral treaties” should be “multilateral”).
