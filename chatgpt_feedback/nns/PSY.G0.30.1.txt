Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on the paper titled **"The Relationship between Depressed Mood and Perceived Parental Alienation, Trust, and Pride in Academic Accomplishments: A Study of Family Factors Associated with Depression"**:

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Clear Research Objectives & Hypotheses**
- The paper has a clear purpose and three well-articulated, testable hypotheses.
- The introduction effectively establishes the importance of depression as a public health issue and situates the study within existing literature.

### 2. **Thorough Literature Review**
- Past research is cited to provide a strong context and rationale for each variable investigated.
- The connection to attachment theory enhances the theoretical framework.

### 3. **Methodological Transparency**
- The sampling procedures (convenience and snowballing) are described in detail.
- Comprehensive descriptions of all measurement tools, their psychometric properties, and how scales were computed are included.
- The use of established measures (e.g., BDI, IPPA) increases the study's credibility.

### 4. **Detailed Results**
- Each hypothesis is tested and statistical outcomes (correlation coefficients, significance levels, sample sizes) are explicitly reported.
- Tables and figures are included to support data presentation (though the figures could potentially be improved in clarity).

### 5. **Balanced Discussion & Self-Critique**
- The discussion acknowledges both the substantive findings and their alignment with previous research.
- Limitations are candidly discussed, demonstrating critical awareness (non-random sampling, small and skewed sample, limitations of measures, correlational design, risk of self-report bias, etc.).
- The researcher recognizes the issue of causality and the limitations in generalizing the results, which is excellent.

### 6. **Appendices and Data Transparency**
- Consent form and survey instruments are included as appendices, along with scoring instructions and codebooks, enhancing clarity and reproducibility.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Sampling and Generalizability**
- While the limitations of convenience sampling are acknowledged, the sample size is still underpowered relative to the initial power analysis. This weakens statistical confidence and generalizability.
- The sample is heavily female and Caucasian, with little discussion on the implications of this demographic skew for interpreting results.

### 2. **Instrument Validity**
- The measure for **parental pride and approval in academic accomplishments** is not validated, which is a potential threat to construct validity. Although this is discussed, the finding should be presented with more caution and suggestions for future research should highlight the need for validated tools.

### 3. **Presentation of Results**
- The scatterplots' axes and points are poorly labeled/unclear in the placeholders ("$"). Providing actual graphs would improve readability.
- It would help to include descriptive statistics (means, SDs) for the key variables in the results section in addition to correlations.

### 4. **Depth in Discussion**
- The discussion could be improved by engaging more with the meaning of the findings—what are the possible mechanisms linking parental relationships and depression in college students? How do these findings compare with results in other age groups or settings?
- Some of the discussion of limitations verges on apologetic ("the findings were already known"), though replication is valuable and necessary in science.

### 5. **APA and Formatting Issues**
- There are minor APA formatting inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent use of italics, font size in tables, headings, etc.).
- The “Running Head” is present but not consistently formatted per APA.

### 6. **Language and Grammar**
- While generally clear, there are moments where sentences are long or slightly awkward, possibly due to the NNS (non-native speaker) background. Some sentences could be streamlined for clarity.

### 7. **Future Directions**
- The conclusion could be strengthened by proposing specific future research directions, such as longitudinal studies, multi-site sampling, or developing and validating new measures.

## **Overall Assessment**

**This is a strong undergraduate research paper that demonstrates an understanding of the research process, statistical analysis, and the importance of critical self-reflection regarding methodology.** The study adds value by testing parental perceptions in an academic context and their link to depression—a meaningful, if preliminary, contribution.

**With greater attention to sampling, measurement validation, and deeper analytical discussion, this paper could serve as a solid foundation for more advanced research or publication.**

---

**Suggestions for Next Steps:**
- Seek a larger and more diverse sample in future studies.
- Consider employing mixed methods (e.g., interviews, longitudinal follow-up).
- Develop or validate the academic pride/approval scale.
- Explore multivariate analyses or mediation models to unpack causal pathways.
