Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, **“The Law of Love.”**

---

### **Strengths**

#### 1. **Clear Thesis and Purpose**
You present a clear thesis: that, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus reinterprets Torah as fundamentally concerned with love—towards God and neighbor—rather than ritual observance. This claim is repeated for emphasis and developed throughout, grounding your essay.

#### 2. **Textual Support and Integration of Scholarship**
You provide relevant textual evidence from Mark (quotations and references) and situate Jesus' teaching in the context of both earlier Jewish tradition (Deuteronomy, Isaiah, Psalms, Jeremiah) and the ongoing debates within Judaism at the time. Your use of footnotes for scriptural cross-references is scholarly and helpful.

#### 3. **Structure and Flow**
The essay is logically organized, with each paragraph building upon the previous one. You move from a general analysis of Jesus’ reinterpretation (in principle), to clear, detailed discussion of specific passages (Mark 7), to theological and historical interpretation.

#### 4. **Depth of Analysis**
You do not settle for surface readings: you reflect on what it means to “circumcise the heart,” how purity relates to inner intention vs. outward ritual, and the revolutionary implications of Jesus’ teaching for Jewish and Gentile identity.

#### 5. **Engagement with Counterarguments/Tradition**
You note that Jesus’ emphasis is not uniquely Christian or entirely new—he is presented as continuing the prophetic critique of empty ritual, and addressing a debate internal to Judaism.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### 1. **Clarity and Conciseness**
While your sophistication and depth are clear, some sentences are quite dense or complex:
- *E.g.,* “It is, therefore, a matter of interpretation: Jesus differs from the authorities of the time in his belief about the tradition of the elders and its conformance with the will of God—which can only be a matter of interpretation for man.”

Consider breaking long sentences down, and directly stating main claims before elaborating.

#### 2. **Engagement with Alternative Interpretations**
Although you note that Jesus is continuing the prophets, you might strengthen your argument by briefly acknowledging other scholarly perspectives or why this interpretation of Mark should be preferred over others (e.g., are there places where ritual is affirmed in Jesus’ ministry?).

#### 3. **Handling of Sources**
You cite the text admirably, but “Christianity continues a movement already unfolding in Judaism towards a new idea of worship…” could be more qualified. Not all scholars agree on this trajectory; recognize the diversity within Judaism and Christianity.

#### 4. **Conclusion**
Your final paragraph is strong but could finish with an explicit restatement of the thesis and its significance—not just for understanding the Gospel of Mark, but for understanding Christianity’s relationship with tradition, ritual, and ethics.

#### 5. **Minor Suggestions**
- Define some terms for non-specialist readers (*e.g.*, “Corban” is explained, but “Torah” might be redefined upon first use).
- Consider smoothing a couple typographical errors and checking consistency in referencing (sometimes you use “Mk,” sometimes “Mark 7”).

### **Sample Edits / Revision Suggestions**

**Original Sentence:**  
> “For the distinction here between ‘heart’ and ‘stomach’ seems not to be between the two as organs both of the body, but between the body and something else. That is to say, it seems that what is meant by ‘the heart’ is not the heart in the chest.”

**Suggested Revision:**  
> “The contrast between ‘heart’ and ‘stomach’ here is not anatomical, but symbolic: the ‘stomach’ represents physical processes, while the ‘heart’ stands for the seat of intention and conscience.”

### **Overall Impression**

This is a thoughtful, scholarly, and well-argued essay. It demonstrates both critical engagement with biblical texts and sensitivity to their historical and religious context. With tightening for clarity and perhaps a broader engagement with alternative viewpoints, it would be a very strong undergraduate paper—possibly even at a graduate level.

**Grade (if requested):** A/A-
