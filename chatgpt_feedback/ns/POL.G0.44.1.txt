Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on the paper based on clarity, argumentation, structure, use of evidence, and mechanics:

---

### Strengths

1. **Clear Topic and Focus:** The central theme—power dynamics in city governance among governments, businesses, and citizens—is clearly introduced and consistently kept in focus throughout.
2. **Appropriate Examples:** The inclusion of specific cases, such as zoning decisions around wind generators and the influence of businesses like Consumers Energy, adds relevant detail and demonstrates real-world relevance.
3. **Engagement with Theory:** References to concepts like Dillon’s Rule and the different models of city government (mayor-council, council-manager, commission) show a solid understanding of relevant political science concepts.
4. **Recognition of Complexity:** The acknowledgment that power is multidimensional (who wins, who sets the agenda, and who shapes attitudes) demonstrates nuance and depth.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Thesis Clarity:**  
   - The opening paragraph provides context but could more explicitly state a central argument or thesis statement. Consider clearly asserting (in one sentence) your main claim about how and why power shifts between governments, businesses, and citizens.
2. **Organization / Flow:**  
   - While main points are all related, transitions between sections could be smoother. Consider separating the paper into clearly defined sections: Introduction, Government Power, Business Influence, Citizens' Role, City Government Structures, Measuring Power, and Conclusion.
   - Some paragraphs are very long, which makes it easy for a reader to lose focus. Breaking up these paragraphs will also help guide the reader through your argument.
3. **Evidence and Citation:**  
   - The use of an example from Consumers Energy is excellent, but mostly anecdotal. Consider referencing more empirical studies, or at least a broader range of examples, to support your arguments.
   - Only one citation (Ross and Levine) is specifically mentioned. Make sure to indicate where particular claims or statistics come from, or clarify when the argument is your own synthesis.
4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The final paragraph does well to summarize, but it could be more forceful. Reiterate your thesis and suggest broader implications or potential areas for further study or reform.
5. **Mechanics and Style:**  
   - There are a few awkward sentences and typos ("where business locate" → "where businesses locate"; “mode of governance” should be “model,” etc.). A careful proofreading will help.
   - Watch for small grammatical errors and repetitions, e.g., “having, maintaining and controlling power” could be simplified.
   - Parenthetical references (e.g., "Ross and Levine pg 144") could use standard citation format—pick either footnotes or in-text citations with a bibliography.

### Specific Suggestions

#### Introduction
- Consider ending with a clear statement: “This paper argues that the form of city government, legal constraints from the state, and the economic power of business collectively determine the shifting balance of power at the city level.”

#### Arguments & Analysis
- Distinguish more clearly between legal/formal power and informal/practical power held by each group.
- When discussing systems like mayor-council vs. council-manager, briefly highlight typical real-world outcomes for each system.
- In the section on “measuring power,” consider integrating this more concretely with your case study or earlier examples.

#### Conclusion
- Summarize the main findings more explicitly.
- Suggest solutions or further questions—e.g., what reforms might help balance these sources of city power more equitably?

### Final Assessment

This paper demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, thoughtful analysis, and appropriate use of examples. With clearer organization, stronger thesis articulation, and closer attention to writing mechanics, it would be even more effective. Good job—there is a solid foundation here to build on!

**If you revise, consider:**
- Providing a clear, arguable thesis in your introduction.
- Structuring your paper with subheadings (if permitted).
- Expanding examples with more evidence or comparative cases.
- Proofreading for grammar and style issues.
- Ending with a stronger, more decisive conclusion.
