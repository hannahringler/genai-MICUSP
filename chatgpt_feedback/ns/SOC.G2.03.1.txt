Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on argumentation, structure, use of sources, and writing clarity. I’ll highlight strengths and suggest areas for improvement.

---

### **Strengths**

#### 1. **Strong Structure and Organization**
- **Clear Thesis:** Your introduction lays out a clear roadmap, stating that you will compare the views of Polanyi, Marshall, and Somers with each other and with liberal/utilitarian thinkers. 
- **Well-Organized Sections:** Dividing your analysis between the Utilitarian and Liberal Tradition, followed by dedicated sections for Polanyi, Marshall, and Somers, makes it easy to follow your argument.

#### 2. **In-Depth Analytical Engagement**
- **Comprehensive Comparisons:** You don’t just describe the thinkers individually, but systematically compare and contrast their ideas of market, state, and civil society.
- **Direct Reference to Texts:** You support your analysis with parenthetical citations and direct references to page numbers in the primary texts—demonstrating a close reading.
- **Contextual Knowledge:** You show understanding of historical and theoretical context (e.g., Speenhamland system, the double movement, and Malthusian checks).

#### 3. **Use of Examples and Evidence**
- **Historical Examples:** Your use of the Townsend “goats and dogs” metaphor and explanation of Speenhamland adds richness to your exposition.
- **Critical Nuance:** You acknowledge cases where thinkers don’t fit neatly into a tradition (e.g., Marshall’s nuanced stance on the free market).

#### 4. **Writing Clarity**
- **Accessible Language:** Despite the complexity, your prose is mostly clear and direct.
- **Definitions:** You take care to define key concepts, such as “fictitious commodities” and the three types of rights in Marshall.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### 1. **Precision in Argumentation**
- **More Explicit Comparative Synthesis:** While each thinker is well-covered individually, your paper would benefit from a dedicated comparative section or more connective tissue throughout. Draw direct comparisons between Polanyi, Marshall, and Somers, not just with the liberals/utilitarians, but with each other.
    - *Example:* Briefly restate how Somers’ approach to class/rights differs from both Polanyi and Marshall in your conclusion.

- **Fully Develop Theoretical Tensions:** For instance, Polanyi's "double movement" is well explained, but could be more clearly contrasted with Marshall's take on expanding rights as a response to market inequalities.

#### 2. **Depth on Somers and Marshall**
- **Marshall’s Relation to Liberals:** You mention that his social rights “would be rejected outright by the liberals” but could clarify why and what responses this elicited historically.
- **Somers’ Critique of Marshall:** Expand a bit on why Marshall’s scheme was too rigid, in Somers’ view, and the implications for contemporary citizenship theory.

#### 3. **Clarity and Redundancy**
- **Reduce Repetition:** There is some overlap in your explanations, especially regarding the market’s role for liberals and Polanyi’s response. Tighten these sections where possible.
- **Footnotes and Asides:** Some asides (e.g., apologizing for space constraints) could be omitted for a more professional tone unless explicitly required by the assignment.

#### 4. **Engagement with All Source Material**
- **Cite More Secondary Literature:** You reference Block & Somers in Polanyi’s section and Alexander in your bibliography, but don’t integrate Alexander’s theory of civil sphere or other referenced theorists (e.g., Bourdieu, Durkheim, Foucault) into your analysis. Brief mention or distinction would demonstrate wider engagement.
- **Direct Quotes:** Use sparingly unless crucial to your argument—paraphrase where possible to exhibit mastery.

#### 5. **Conclusion**
- **Summative Paragraph Needed:** Your paper would benefit from a short conclusion that succinctly restates your findings, reiterates the key differences among the theorists, and possibly comments on the broader implications for contemporary debates about market, state, and society.

### **Minor Suggestions**
- **Proofreading:** Watch for minor typos (e.g., “tenants” should be “tenets”; “Polanyi does not does not share” is a repetition).
- **Citation Consistency:** If you’re following a particular style guide, ensure all sources are consistently cited.

## **Overall Assessment**

Your paper is comprehensive, shows thorough reading and understanding of the thinkers involved, and is well-structured for clarity. To reach the next level: further tighten comparative analysis, expand on Marshall and Somers, address all referenced sources, and sharpen your conclusion. This is a strong graduate-level effort, and with a little more fine-tuning, it could be excellent!
