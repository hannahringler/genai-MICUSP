Absolutely! Here is detailed, constructive feedback on your paper, based on its structure, content, argumentation, use of evidence, and clarity.

---

**1. Thesis & Focus:**  
*Strengths*
- The paper clearly identifies and addresses the central theme of desire in Augustine’s *Confessions*.
- You provide a focused thesis: “Through The Confessions, Augustine deduces what society desires, why said things can be desired, the effects of the desires, and their remedies.”

*Suggestions*
- You could clarify your thesis even more by directly stating your main argument (e.g., "Augustine argues that desire misdirected toward creation instead of the Creator leads to spiritual disorder, but can be remedied by following Christ's example of humility and love").

**2. Organization/Structure:**
*Strengths*
- The essay is logically structured, moving from defining desire, to discussion of time and materiality, to free will, and finally to Christ as remedy.
- Each paragraph transitions smoothly into the next.

*Suggestions*
- The introduction could be more engaging. Currently, it starts with a statistic. Consider starting with a provocative question or statement about the universal nature of desire, or a brief anecdote from Augustine’s life, to invite the reader in.
- Some paragraphs (especially those about time and existence) could be broken up for easier reading.

**3. Use of Evidence:**
*Strengths*
- Effective and relevant use of quotations from Augustine. The citations add authority to your arguments.
- The distinction you draw between desire for creation and desire for the Creator is well-supported.

*Suggestions*
- Occasionally, it would help to contextualize or interpret your quotations a bit more. For example, unpack challenging quotations in more detail for readers who may not be familiar with Augustine.
- Consider drawing more practical examples from Augustine’s own narrative—such as his theft of the pears or his experience with lust—to illustrate your points.

**4. Argumentation & Analysis:**
*Strengths*
- You show strong understanding of Augustine’s philosophical framework (time, creation, free will).
- The analysis of the “natural order” and separation from God is insightful.

*Suggestions*
- You sometimes repeat concepts (e.g., “to turn from God is to pervert free will” is stated in a few forms). Once you’ve established a core idea, you can move on and use those phrases more succinctly.
- It could be fruitful to consider possible objections or complications: For example, if all creation is good, why is desire for created things so problematic? Might desire play a positive role when rightly ordered?

**5. Style, Clarity, and Mechanics:**
*Strengths*
- Your writing is generally clear and academic.
- Most sentences are well-constructed, and your vocabulary is appropriate.

*Suggestions*
- Watch for awkward constructions, e.g., “why said things can beare desired.” (should be “can be desired”).
- Minor typographical errors (possibly from OCR? “beare desired,” “perverse” instead of “pervert,” “laid out path of always moving...”) should be corrected on final edit.
- Some complex sentences could be simplified for clarity.

**6. Conclusion:**
*Strengths*
- The conclusion restates your central points and ties back to the thesis.
- You end with a statement about the enduring truth of Augustine’s ideas, which is strong.

*Suggestions*
- Avoid phrases like “A testament to the truth of Augustine’s deductions is to acknowledge how The Confessions have withstood the test of time”. Instead, you might say: “The enduring influence of Augustine’s *Confessions* attests to the enduring relevance of his insights on desire.”
- Consider giving a final reflection or a call to action—e.g., what can modern readers gain from Augustine’s account of desire?

**7. Formatting/Citations:**
*Strengths*
- You cite your sources and include parenthetical page numbers.

*Suggestions*
- If this is for a class, make sure the citation style matches your instructor’s preference (MLA, Chicago, etc.).
- Only include footnote-style citations or reference list as required.

**Overall Assessment:**
This is a cogent and thoughtful essay on Augustine’s account of desire. You demonstrate a good grasp of the theological and philosophical underpinnings of *Confessions* and use strong textual evidence. With attention to clarity, cohesion, and addressing possible counterpoints or complications, you can strengthen the essay further. Good work!
