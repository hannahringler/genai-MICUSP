Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on **strengths**, **areas for improvement**, and **overall assessment**:

---

## Strengths

1. **Clear Structure and Organization**
   - The paper is logically organized, with clear sections that follow the flow of your lesson (introduction, lesson steps, conclusion).
   - Each section is outlined and explained, making it easy for the reader to follow your reasoning.

2. **Theoretical Grounding**
   - You reference relevant discourse analysis concepts such as schemata, genre identification, and approaches like top-down and bottom-up processing.
   - The paper demonstrates a strong awareness of how these theories relate to second language pedagogy.

3. **Practical Application**
   - The lesson plan you describe is realistic and well-matched to the target audience (advanced L2 learners at the University of Michigan).
   - There is a nice balance between comprehension and functional use of language.
   - Tasks are scaffolded: students build from identifying genre to using the text for a real academic planning task.

4. **Reflection and Rationale**
   - You thoughtfully discuss both your intentions for the lesson and potential hurdles (e.g., unfamiliar vocabulary).
   - There is valuable reflection on the limitations of schemata transfer from L1 to L2 and the need for explicit instruction.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**
   - Some sentences are overly long or a bit repetitive; try to condense your ideas for greater impact.
   - Example: Instead of "From my experience with second language learning classes, it seems that there is a primary focus...", you could write, "In my experience, second language classes often focus primarily on discourse analysis, rather than using texts as functional resources."

2. **Integration of Citations**
   - You mention (Cook, 80) and (Cook 89) but do not include a full reference. Be sure to properly cite all your sources so readers can find them.
   - Consider introducing your sources more clearly: briefly state who Cook is and why their work is relevant.

3. **Specificity in Task Description**
   - Some activities are described generally (e.g., “I pose questions...”), but you could increase clarity and reproducibility by providing sample questions or examples of lesson steps.
   - Instead of "pose questions that will make them interact independently," specify what kind of questions these are (e.g., “What are the degree requirements for a major in Biology?”).

4. **Language and Grammar**
   - There are minor grammatical issues (such as missing articles and awkward phrasings) that could be cleaned up in a revision.
   - For instance: "developing a understanding of a text’s discourse" should be "developing an understanding..."

5. **Depth in Reflection/Conclusion**
   - While you do reflect on the effectiveness of functional tasks, you could strengthen your conclusion by mentioning possible variations for different proficiency levels, or how you would assess student learning.

## Overall Assessment

This is a strong and thoughtful proposal that demonstrates deep understanding of discourse analysis and its implications for language teaching. Your lesson is well-structured, appropriately challenging, and supported by theoretical concepts. To further strengthen your work, streamline your prose, clarify your citations, and provide more concrete examples within your lesson steps.

**Final tips:**
- Proofread for grammar/word choice
- Add a short works cited/reference section
- Where possible, show rather than tell (give explicit examples of student tasks or dialogue)

**Overall, well done!**
