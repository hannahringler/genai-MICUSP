Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback breakdown for your paper, “Woolf’s Women: Behind the Walls,” covering **thesis/argument, structure, evidence/use of sources, style, and areas for improvement**:

---

### **1. Thesis & Argument**
**Strengths:**
- Your thesis is clear: you argue that the traditional roles of women as described by Woolf, Chopin, and Gilman are analogous to forms of enslavement and oppression.
- The comparison between women's social status and slavery is provocative and engages readers.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Consider refining your thesis to make it more specific: Are you primarily interested in the psychological, social, or literary impact of this oppression? Clarifying this can help tighten your argument throughout.

---

### **2. Organization & Structure**
**Strengths:**
- The essay has a logical flow: you begin with Woolf, move to Gilman, and then to Chopin, drawing connections between each.
- You introduce the literary works in the introduction and follow up with relevant commentary.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Your paragraphs often blend summary and analysis; try to separate these, ensuring each paragraph serves a clear analytical purpose.
- The transition between works could be smoothed by more explicitly linking themes or reinforcing how each work builds on your overall argument.

---

### **3. Use of Evidence**
**Strengths:**
- Strong quotations: You directly quote Woolf, Chopin, and Gilman, demonstrating close reading.
- Quotes are integrated and generally well-explained.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Sometimes, analysis after quotes could be deepened. For example, when you cite, “overcome,” from Woolf, expand on the implications and resonance with the other two authors.
- Avoid simply reiterating what happens in the plot; probe more into literary devices, narrative perspective, and symbolism (e.g., the wallpaper in Gilman).

---

### **4. Style & Clarity**
**Strengths:**
- Your writing is clear, articulate, and avoids jargon.
- Varied sentence structure and sophisticated vocabulary.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- At a few moments, sentences run long or stack too many ideas (“Woolf… draws comparisons between a woman’s subordinate lifestyle and a slave’s…”). Try breaking complex ideas into shorter sentences.
- Watch for passive voice (“…women will ‘scribble some pages…’ but will be careful to hide them…”)—active voice can be more compelling.

---

### **5. Engagement with Broader Context**
**Strengths:**
- Noting the privileged status of Woolf, Chopin, and Gilman adds intellectual nuance—great move!
- The final paragraph’s reflection on present relevance is a strong touch.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- You mention “the pattern will not submit.” Briefly note if any character/author offers a vision for change or resistance.
- Are there contemporary implications, or does your argument remain strictly historical/literary?

---

### **6. Formatting and Citations**
**Strengths:**
- Full citations provided at the end.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Make sure that in-text quotes have correct parenthetical citations (Chopin), not just taglines.

---

### **Summary**
You deliver a sophisticated, thoughtful comparison of women’s oppression in three key texts. By tightening your organization, deepening your analysis (especially of symbols/motifs), and clarifying your main through-line, your paper could become even more compelling. You’re already employing an academic tone, using well-chosen textual evidence, and displaying strong insight. Nice job!
