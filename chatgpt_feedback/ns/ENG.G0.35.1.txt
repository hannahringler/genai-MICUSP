Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, “Less is More: Courtship in Twelfth Night”:

### Strengths

#### 1. **Clear Thesis and Focus**
- Your introduction presents a strong, specific thesis: that Shakespeare uses *Twelfth Night* to critique courtship, suggesting that it is not only unnecessary for true love but can also be superficial and even counterproductive.
- The central argument is clear and remains focused throughout the essay.

#### 2. **Close Reading and Textual Evidence**
- You use substantial quotations from the play to support your points. For example, you cite both Orsino’s and Olivia’s language and actions to demonstrate the superficiality of their courtships.
- The analysis of these moments is thoughtful and demonstrates a good understanding of the play’s themes and character motivations.

#### 3. **Comparative Analysis**
- You provide good comparative analysis, particularly in the way you contrast Orsino’s and Olivia’s performative love with Viola’s sincere, unexpressed love.
- Your discussion of the play’s ending, where characters end up happy despite failed courtships, solidifies your argument.

#### 4. **Organization**
- The essay follows a logical progression, moving from Orsino, to Olivia, to Viola, and finally to the play’s resolution.
- Paragraphs are well-structured: each one has a topic sentence, evidence, and analysis.

#### 5. **Style and Clarity**
- The writing is clear and mature, making strong points without excessive wordiness.
- Your language is academic, but not inaccessible, and you avoid plot summary in favor of analysis.

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Use of Critical Sources**
- The essay relies solely on close reading of the play. Consider engaging with at least one or two critical interpretations of *Twelfth Night* or Shakespearean courtship. This could help strengthen your argument, show awareness of scholarly discourse, and provide new perspectives.

#### 2. **Addressing Counterarguments**
- While you effectively critique performative courtship, you could strengthen the paper by acknowledging moments in the play where courtship might appear positive or necessary (e.g., the comedic value, or the social constraints of Elizabethan society).
- You might consider why Shakespeare depicts so much courtship if it is largely ineffective in the play.

#### 3. **Deeper Contextualization**
- Although you touch on the “fickleness” and “self-indulgence” of Orsino and Olivia’s desires, you could say a bit more about the social and theatrical context of *Twelfth Night*. For example:
    - How does Twelfth Night’s setting in Illyria (a world of topsy-turvy behavior) influence courtship?
    - How do gender roles and disguises complicate “normal” courtship patterns?
- Briefly connecting these themes to the play’s comedy could add depth (e.g., does the failure of courtship serve a comedic purpose?).

#### 4. **Conclusion Expansion**
- Your conclusion is solid, but you could end with a broader reflection: What might Shakespeare’s skeptical portrayal of courtship say to modern audiences about love and relationships? Is there a lesson for viewers/readers outside the world of the play?

#### 5. **Minor Stylistic Points**
- Occasionally the prose is a little repetitive (e.g., “selfish” and “self-indulgent” appear close together; ‘superficial’ is also repeated). Varying your language or unpacking these terms further (what does it mean, specifically, for love to be selfish in this context?) could enhance sophistication.
