Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on the paper, "**Domestic Violence as a Social Problem: The Origins of its Construction and Implications for Future Institutional Response—An Intersectionality Approach**". This feedback will address **structure, argumentation, use of sources, writing style, strengths, and areas for improvement.**

---

## **Overall Impression**

This is a thoughtful, well-organized, and clearly argued undergraduate paper that demonstrates strong engagement with both sociological theory and feminist history. The student applies social constructionist theory and an intersectional lens effectively, situating the origins of “domestic violence” as a public issue within the broader feminist movement and examining its implications for institutional response. The literature is well-chosen, and the proposed research plan is rigorous and appropriate.

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Clear Thesis & Research Question**
- The paper clearly lays out a focused research question: *How did the identities of early feminist leaders shape the construction of domestic violence as a social problem and institutional responses to it?*
- The hypothesis is well-articulated and logically leads from the literature review.

### 2. **Theoretical Engagement**
- The discussion of social constructionism (Blumer, Spector & Kitsuse, Best, Miller & Holstein, etc.) is nuanced and shows an understanding of both strict and contextual constructionist perspectives.
- The integration of organizational sociology (Lofland, Jepperson & Meyer, Selznick) adds depth to the analysis of institutional development.

### 3. **Intersectionality**
- The use of intersectionality as a frame—recognizing the influence of race, class, and sexuality in the feminist movement—shows contemporary relevance and a sophisticated grasp of current debates.

### 4. **Historical Context**
- The paper is grounded in a strong historical narrative, helping the reader understand both the timeline and evolution of feminist discourse and institutions.

### 5. **Proposed Research Design**
- The planned methodology (media analysis, review of organizational documents, comparison of various shelters, and examination of foundational texts) is ambitious and appropriate for the research question.

### 6. **Writing Style**
- The paper is well-written, largely free of significant grammatical errors, and demonstrates a strong academic voice.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Depth of Intersectional Analysis**
- While intersectionality is named and the homogeneity of the early leadership is noted, the paper could benefit from more concrete examples of *how* non-white, non-heterosexual, or working-class women’s needs were overlooked in practice, both in discourse and in institutional arrangements.
    - **Suggestion:** Incorporate specific case studies or secondary research demonstrating the shortcomings or exclusion of minority women in early feminist organizations or shelters.

### 2. **Analysis of Media Sources**
- The proposed research design is strong, but the actual paper would be strengthened by a sample or preliminary findings from this media analysis—even in the form of a paragraph summarizing likely themes.
    - **Suggestion:** Even a hypothetical or anticipated set of findings would show greater engagement with methodology.

### 3. **Discussion of Counter-Movements**
- The paper, while discussing the mainstream feminist movement, could briefly address any concurrent efforts by minority women or critiques from within the movement (e.g. National Black Feminist Organization, Chicana feminists, LGBTQ+ activists).
    - **Suggestion:** Even a few sentences or references to these groups in the main body (not just the bibliography) would illustrate a fuller landscape.

### 4. **Updating the Literature**
- Much of the literature cited is foundational, but some is pre-2000. Consider bringing in at least one or two recent works on intersectionality and domestic violence to situate the argument in the cutting edge of current scholarship (if possible for a revision).
    - **Suggestion:** Reference more recent work (Crenshaw, Richie, Sokoloff and Dupont from the 2000s onward).

### 5. **Minor Clarity Improvements**
- A few sentences are long and may benefit from breaking up for readability.

### 6. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion restates the argument clearly, but might be strengthened by offering concrete policy or organizational recommendations for making services more inclusive moving forward.

## **Format and Structure**

- **Organization:** Logical progression from theory to history to institutional analysis to research design.
- **Sources:** Citations are comprehensive and relevant. The inclusion of an appendix with a timeline is a nice organizational touch.
- **Language:** Academic and precise.

---

## **Summary Feedback**

This is a well-founded, theoretically sophisticated undergraduate paper. It demonstrates a strong grasp of the sociology of social problems, feminist history, and intersectionality. To further improve, consider deepening the intersectional analysis with more concrete examples, updating the literature, providing even a speculative preview of the empirical research, and tightening the writing/style in places for clarity. Adding actionable recommendations in the conclusion could also reinforce the applied significance of the argument.

**Grade range:** High B+ to A (depending on assignment rubric and whether any empirical data is ultimately included).
