Absolutely! Here's a detailed feedback on your paper, **"The Representation of Jesus and Women in the Gospel of Mark"**:

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Thesis and Focus**
You present a clear thesis early on: Mark's Gospel gives weight to stories and interactions between Jesus and women to enhance its social justice themes while showing some reservations about female followers. Throughout the paper, you remain focused on this central argument.

### 2. **Use of Evidence**
You consistently support your claims with textual evidence, referencing specific stories (the hemorrhaging woman, women at the tomb, the anointing woman) and relevant passages (Mark 10, Mark 12, Mark 14, etc.). You also make good use of scholarly resources, particularly Coogan, to reinforce your points.

### 3. **Comparative Analysis**
Your comparison between Mark and the other synoptic gospels, especially Matthew, is insightful. It helps contextualize Mark’s portrayal of women in light of broader Gospel themes.

### 4. **Engagement with Complexities**
You don’t shy away from the tension and ambiguity at the end of Mark or within Mark’s presentation of women. Instead, you discuss it thoughtfully, recognizing layers within Mark’s message.

### 5. **Strong Organization**
Each paragraph builds logically on the previous one, first establishing the social justice theme, then providing examples, and finally discussing the complications at the end of the gospel.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Thesis Refinement**
Your thesis is clear but could be stated more concisely. At times, it reads as a long, multi-part sentence. Consider condensing it for sharper impact.

*Suggestion*:  
*"The Gospel of Mark grants women significant roles to highlight its social justice message, yet ultimately reveals lingering reservations about their status through the ambiguity at the narrative's end."*

---

### 2. **Depth of Analysis**
While you summarize stories effectively, you could push your analysis deeper. For example, you mention that Mark’s ending leaves the reader questioning the role of women, but you might explore *why* the author would do this. What social or theological functions might such ambiguity serve?

*Prompt for development*:  
How might Mark’s portrayal of women as both faithful and fearful reflect early Christian community tensions or concerns about women's leadership roles?

---

### 3. **Engagement with Scholarship**
Coogan is cited several times, but the argument could be enriched with additional scholars. For example, you could bring in feminist biblical scholars or historians of early Christianity to affirm or complicate your readings.

*Suggestion*:  
Consider referencing scholars like Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza, Amy-Jill Levine, or others who have written on women in the Gospels.

---

### 4. **Language and Style**
Overall, the writing is clear, but a few sentences are wordy or awkwardly constructed. Watch for passive voice and strive for more direct statements.

*Example*:  
*"This story is important because it shows a seemingly 'unclean' woman taking control of her own healing."*  
This could become  
*"This story is significant because it depicts an 'unclean' woman actively seeking her own healing, challenging social norms."*

---

### 5. **Conclusion**
Your conclusion is good, but could be stronger. Instead of mainly summarizing, it can more assertively state the significance of your findings. Why should a reader today care about Mark's view of women? What does your analysis contribute to the broader study of gender in religious texts?

---

### 6. **Citation and Formatting**
Ensure all references are properly cited (including in-text citations where appropriate) in your preferred citation style. Clarify which version of the Bible you use for quotations.
