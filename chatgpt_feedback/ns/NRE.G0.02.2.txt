Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on your paper, touching on **content, structure, analysis, evidence, and style**. Your essay has strong points, but also areas for improvement.

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Purpose and Focus**
You address a timely and important question: whether the new Green Revolution for Africa will be positive or negative. Your thesis is clear and your arguments directly connect to this central question.

### 2. **Incorporation of Sources**
You skillfully reference authoritative sources (the FAO, Joseph Stiglitz, Peter Rosset, and the Gates/Rockefeller Foundations). Using both primary and secondary sources strengthens your credibility.

### 3. **Critical Perspective**
You demonstrate critical thinking, acknowledging both the intentions behind the initiative and past outcomes, including negative consequences (increased inequality, job loss for rural laborers, indebtedness).

### 4. **Suggestions for Improvement**
Rather than just criticizing the new Green Revolution, you offer recommendations (“they should refocus their efforts,” “proceed without any outside agendas,” and “take a holistic and careful approach”). This adds depth to your analysis.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Thesis/Introduction**
- **Suggestion:** While your introduction mentions what you will examine, the thesis could be more explicit and assertive. For example:
  - *“Although the Green Revolution increased crop yields, its mixed legacy warns that a similar approach in Africa may bring unintended social and economic consequences unless carefully adapted to local conditions.”*

### 2. **Organization and Transitions**
- The paper sometimes jumps between different points (policy critique, summary of history, problems with hunger, recommendations). It might benefit from clearer section transitions and topic sentences.
- **Suggestion:** Use clearer signposting such as, “Firstly… Secondly…” or headings (if permitted). Ensure each paragraph has a clear main idea linked to your thesis.

### 3. **Depth and Balance**
- You mention both positives and negatives, but your analysis of potential benefits is brief compared to your critique.
- **Suggestion:** More thoroughly explore possible ways a new Green Revolution *could* succeed in Africa, perhaps referencing specific elements that differentiate Africa from Asia/Latin America.

### 4. **Evidence and Explanation**
- Some important claims would be stronger with more specific examples. For instance:
  - *“Not only do the workers lose a job, but the tractor owners go into debt…”* — Can you provide data or specific cases to illustrate this?
  - When discussing Rosset’s claims on food sufficiency, give a concrete present-day example (e.g., “Country X produces Y% more grain than it needs, yet Z% of the population is hungry due to distribution and price issues.”)
- **Suggestion:** More concrete examples and perhaps a quotation or two to deepen your analysis.

### 5. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion restates your stance, but could end with a stronger, more memorable statement about the stakes or urgency.
- **Suggestion:** Re-emphasize the human consequences or the global importance of getting this right.

### 6. **Clarity and Style**
- Most sentences are clear, but a few are a bit long or complex, making your argument harder to follow.
- **Suggestion:** Read through for sentence length and vary structure for clarity. Avoid overly complex sentences where simpler language would be more direct.

### 7. **Citations and Formatting**
- Ensure proper and consistent in-text citations (MLA, APA, Chicago, whichever format is required), and include a works cited/reference section if your assignment calls for it.

## Sample Improved Introduction

> The Rockefeller and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundations’ plan for a new Green Revolution in Africa is motivated by the desire to end hunger and poverty. However, evidence from the original Green Revolution in Asia and Latin America points to a legacy of both increased food production and greater social inequality. This essay argues that unless the new Green Revolution is fundamentally different—addressing not only yields but also access and economic justice—it risks repeating the mistakes of the past and undermining its own worthy goals.
