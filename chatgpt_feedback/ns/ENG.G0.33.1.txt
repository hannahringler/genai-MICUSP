Certainly! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper "Limited Recovery: Trauma in Obejas’ Cuban America," with strengths, areas for improvement, and some specific suggestions:

---

## **Overall Impressions**

Your paper offers a thoughtful and nuanced reading of Achy Obejas’ *Memory Mambo*, focusing on trauma in the context of Cuban-American cultural and political realities. You successfully integrate psychological theory with literary analysis, showing a strong grasp of both fields. The argument is focused, your engagement with the text is close, and your use of secondary sources is generally effective.

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Theoretical Integration**
You apply psychological frameworks (Freud, Janet, Herman) in a way that is clear and relevant to your literary analysis. The connections between theory and the events/characters in *Memory Mambo* are well made (e.g., dissociation, collective trauma, the "unspeakable" nature of trauma).

### **2. Nuanced Character Analysis**
You avoid oversimplifying Jimmy as a purely evil character. Your discussion of him as both perpetrator and victim is insightful, helping complicate the moral landscape of the novel.

### **3. Strong Use of Evidence**
Your reading is grounded in numerous well-chosen quotations from Obejas and your secondary sources. The textual evidence supports your claims convincingly.

### **4. Cultural/Rhetorical Awareness**
You recognize the limitations of applying Western psychoanalytic models to a collective or culturally specific experience (Cuban-American/exile), and you raise skeptical, critical questions about this very act.

---

## **Areas for Improvement**

### **1. Organizational Clarity**
While individual sections are well argued, the transitions between ideas can feel abrupt. Sometimes the argument jumps quickly from Freudian theory to textual evidence without a roadmap for the reader.

**Suggestion:**  
Consider adding topic sentences at the start of sections/paragraphs that signpost the upcoming argument and clarify its relevance to your thesis.

### **2. Thesis Articulation and Restatement**
Your thesis is most clearly articulated on page 1—Juani’s trauma reveals a "deeply pathological" Cuban-American life, possibly insurmountable for someone who wants to heal. While strong, it would be helpful to restate or echo this idea in your conclusion to reinforce thematic unity.

**Suggestion:**  
Restate your main claims in the conclusion, connecting back explicitly to both the personal and collective implications you raised at the beginning.

### **3. Overreliance on Secondary Authority**
While Judith Herman and Freud provide valuable frameworks, at times you lean heavily on quotes to do the interpretive work instead of more fully analyzing their import for your reading of the novel.

**Suggestion:**  
After quoting or paraphrasing secondary sources, offer an extra sentence or two unpacking their significance to the novel (i.e., "This matters for Juani because...").

### **4. Limited Engagement with Difference**
There are provocative moments where you recognize potential limitations of psychoanalytic/Western models for exile/immigrant or collective trauma ("classic psychoanalysis" is troubled by the uncertainty of truth, etc.). However, you don’t fully develop this critique or offer alternative frameworks.

**Suggestion:**  
Introduce—at least briefly—what alternative models might be, or raise more pointed questions about what is "missing" from the psychoanalytic lens for this context.

### **5. Concluding Section**
Your conclusion is somewhat open-ended, which fits the novel's ambiguity, but it might benefit from a more direct summation of your main points and their literary-critical implications.

**Suggestion:**  
Briefly state what your analysis adds to the scholarship or understanding of *Memory Mambo*; suggest possible further lines of inquiry.

---

## **Stylistic & Minor Notes**
- Watch for minor grammatical errors ("it's" instead of "its" in "the novel’s final scene is troubling because of it’s content...").
- Paragraphs occasionally run very long; consider breaking up for greater readability.
- The use of the "rotting meat" metaphor is vivid, but you hedge later that it's "inept." This could be revised for greater clarity.

---

## **Summary Statement**

**In sum:**  
This is a thoughtful, well-researched, and sensitive essay that ably combines theory and textual close reading. With clearer roadmapping, occasional expansion of your critique, and a tighter conclusion, this paper would make an even stronger contribution to discussion of trauma and exile in literature.

**Grade Estimate:** A- to A
