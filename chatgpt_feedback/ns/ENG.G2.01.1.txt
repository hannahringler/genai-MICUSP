Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback for your paper, “Jews, Waiting, and Messianic Masochism in H. Rider Haggard’s *She*”:

---

**Strengths**

**1. Strong Thesis & Clear Argumentation:**  
Your central argument is clear and thought-provoking: you show how Haggard’s representations of Jews in *She* are intricately connected to wider 19th-century English anxieties and reflect a specific strategy of relegating Jews, and other ancient civilizations, to the past for the sake of promoting imperial ideology. The articulation of “messianic masochism” as a lens through which to read both the Jews’ and Ayesha’s state of waiting is original and productive.

**2. Impressive Contextualization:**  
You expertly situate the novel in its socio-historical context, referencing English attitudes toward Jews, the “Jewish Question,” and the period’s debates on race, religion, and nation. Your use of critics like Endelman, Cheyette, Ragussis, and Katz demonstrates strong command of the relevant scholarship.

**3. Engagement with Theory:**  
The incorporation of Zygmunt Bauman, Jonathan Freedman, Gilles Deleuze, Kaja Silverman, and their discussion of masochism and messianism is sophisticated. You succeed in making these concepts accessible and relevant to your close readings without letting them overtake your analysis.

**4. Well-Integrated Textual Analysis:**  
You engage closely with the text of *She*, quoting dialogue and narration to support your points. Especially effective is your treatment of Ayesha’s waiting, its romantic and political dimensions, and how it parallels and contrasts with the “waiting” of Jews according to Haggard’s schema.

**5. Nuanced and Self-Reflective:**  
You note the dangers of over-homogenizing Christian and Jewish traditions and are careful not to flatten complex theological distinctions—a real strength in a paper on such sensitive material.

**Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

**1. Organization and Signposting:**  
- The paper’s argument is generally clear, but the body sections tend to blend together. Adding stronger signposting (i.e., topic sentences and periodic summaries) would help guide the reader through each major argumentative step.
- Consider adding explicit subheadings, or at least a clearer transition between the critical context, biographical discussion, theoretical frameworks, and close reading.

**2. Biographical Criticism & Speculation:**  
- The section exploring Haggard’s possible Jewish ancestry and the impact this may have had on his writing is interesting, but a bit speculative. While you mark it appropriately as speculation, perhaps brevity here is your ally unless you feel you can develop it with more direct textual evidence from Haggard’s own writings.

**3. Scope & Depth Balance:**  
- You reference many major critics and ideas (messianism, masochism, imperial ideology, assimilation politics, personal biography…) which sometimes makes it difficult for readers to know what to prioritize. Do you want the main contribution of your paper to be about messianism and masochism, or about the ideological work *She* performs with respect to Jews in general? Consider making this hierarchy clearer.
- The engagement with Deleuze and Silverman, while excellent, could be compressed slightly or more tightly linked to the central close readings, to avoid the risk of the paper reading as “theory for theory’s sake.”

**4. Nuanced Engagement with Counterarguments:**  
- At some moments, the paper seems to suggest that Haggard’s relegation of Jews to the past is largely successful and unchallenged—yet the figure of Holly as “unbelieving Jew” and the anxieties you cite might point toward unresolved tensions. Can you acknowledge more explicitly where Haggard’s strategy falters, or where the complexity “slips through the cracks”? Even a few sentences recognizing resistant or alternative readings would strengthen your argument.

**5. Conclusion:**  
- Your final paragraph is strong, but could be more emphatic. Emphasize how your reading offers something new to the scholarship (is it the masochism/messianism connection? Is it about the uses of Jewishness in imperial ideology?). Give a sense of what lessons *She* offers for the study of late Victorian literature more broadly, or for understanding the uses of “the Jew” in the cultural imagination.

**Minor Notes:**
- Be sure to double-check your citations for consistency and proper formatting.
- Occasionally, your in-text transitions (e.g., “As I have argued above...”) can be streamlined for academic polish.
- There are a few long quotes (e.g., from Michael); make sure these are all necessary and serve your analysis directly.

**Overall Assessment:**  
This is an intellectually ambitious, highly engaging paper that combines close reading, literary theory, and historical context with a high degree of skill. It would be very impressive at the upper undergraduate or graduate level. With a few tweaks for organization, concision, and argumentative prioritization, this could easily become a publishable seminar paper or the basis for a longer research project.

**Grade Estimate:** A or A+
