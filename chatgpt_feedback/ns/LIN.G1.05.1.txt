## Overall Feedback

### Strengths

1. **Clear Structure:**  
   - The paper is well organized with a logical progression from introduction, descriptive data, morphological analysis, to formal OT analysis.
   - Section headings and topic sentences are clear, which guides the reader logically through the argument.

2. **Engagement with Literature:**  
   - The author demonstrates strong familiarity with both foundational and recent research (e.g., Schütz, Hayes, Prince & Smolensky).
   - The literature review is concise but sufficient to position the analysis.

3. **Data Presentation:**  
   - Data from Hawaiian are clearly exemplified, with glosses and IPA where appropriate.
   - The use of illustrative examples is effective in highlighting the empirical patterns.

4. **Integration of Morphology and Prosody:**  
   - The insight that irregular stress patterns are regular when analyzed in terms of morphological structure is compelling.
   - The paper uses theoretical tools (recursive prosodic words, OT constraints) to tie morphological composition to phonological outcome in a clear, motivated way.

5. **Theoretical Rigor:**  
   - The constraint-based analysis uses Standard OT, as claimed, with constraints well defined.
   - Tableau are used cleanly for clarity.

6. **Critical Reflection:**  
   - The author is cautious about circularity (not letting stress define morphology), which shows good critical thinking.
   - The mention of exceptions (like /'ule'uleu/) shows intellectual honesty.

### Areas for Improvement / Suggestions

1. **Clarity for Non-Specialists:**  
   - The paper assumes a high degree of linguistic background (e.g., understanding of OT, foot structure, and prosodic hierarchy).
   - If intended for a broader audience, including a brief explanation of key concepts (mora, foot, prosodic word) could help.

2. **Data Coverage:**  
   - While many key patterns are covered, the author states that only some cases with complex morphology are treated; explicitly noting if any other systematic exceptions exist would strengthen the empirical coverage.
   - It may help to provide more explicit data on heavy syllables and clarify cases of diphthongs.

3. **OT Formalism:**  
   - Some tableaux are presented without full discussion of losing candidates and the rationale for their elimination. Make sure you explicitly walk the reader through at least one tableau step-by-step.
   - The switch from "RMOST" to "RMOST’" could be more clearly flagged in terms of effects on constraint interaction and how this resolves ambiguity.

4. **Morphological Diagnostics:**  
   - The analysis sometimes assumes word-internal prosodic word boundaries (especially for reduplication/compounding). Where possible, cite additional evidence (etymological, distributional, or historical) for these divisions.

5. **Typographical/Formatting Issues:**  
   - There are a few small issues (e.g., the term "parsing" used as "PASRE-SYL," typos such as “later case” instead of “latter case”)—correct for clarity.
   - Some parentheses and footnotes may be misplaced (for example, footnote markers could be consistent).

6. **Broader Typological Context:**  
   - You cite that bidirectional stress is "not uncommon" and give a few language names—expanding a bit on which typological families display similar patterns and why Hawaiian fits in would add value.
   - Relating your findings to possible diachronic explanations or areal features could enrich the discussion.

7. **Conclusion Section:**  
   - The paper ends somewhat abruptly after the last set of tableaux and reference list.
   - Consider adding a short conclusion summarizing the core findings, implications for Hawaiian linguistics and OT, and avenues for future research (e.g., accounting for outlier forms like /'ule'uleu/).

### Minor Points

- **Reference Consistency:** References are generally well formatted, but double-check any inconsistencies.
- **Glossing:** Occasionally, glossing is not fully explicit (e.g., “meal” for 'āina, which usually means ‘land’); aim for accuracy in glosses.
- **Gender/Identity Note:** The identification as “Male - Native Speaker” in the MICUSP metadata is irrelevant to paper content and could be omitted if not required by context.

## Summary:

This is a strong research paper: clear, thoughtful, theoretically sophisticated, and well-argued. It makes a meaningful contribution by showing that what appear to be irregularities in Hawaiian stress are often systematic when morphology is considered. With small improvements to clarity, expanded context, and a concise forward-looking conclusion, this could easily form the basis for a publishable analysis or a very strong term paper.
