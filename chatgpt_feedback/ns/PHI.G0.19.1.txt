Absolutely! Below is a detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions.

---

### **Overall Strengths**

**1. Clear Structure and Flow**
- The paper is organized logically: it opens with an introduction to Hume’s and Smith’s theories, discusses each philosopher’s views in detail, and then compares them directly. This helps the reader follow your argument step by step.
- Paragraph transitions are generally smooth, and you do a good job signaling when you are shifting from one thinker (or topic) to the next.

**2. Demonstrates Strong Understanding**
- You display a very solid grasp of Hume’s and Smith’s theories of justice, including key distinctions (artificial virtue/convention vs. impartial projection/warranted resentment).
- Citations of primary texts show you are engaging directly with original philosophical arguments, not just secondary summaries.

**3. Use of Examples and Analogies**
- The utilization of analogies (e.g., the oarsmen, pirates, mortgage thief) to clarify philosophical points enhances the clarity and accessibility of your explanations.
- The application of justice, resentment, and benevolence to practical scenarios helps make your points relatable.

**4. Comparative Analysis**
- Your comparison of Hume and Smith is thoughtful and does more than just list differences; it tries to synthesize what is at stake with each thinker’s approach.

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Thesis Statement and Framing**
- While your introduction highlights a key difference between Hume and Smith, the thesis could be made more explicit. For example, state overtly what *follows* from the difference—does this make one theory preferable, more relevant today, or more internally consistent?
- Consider previewing your paper’s structure (what you will cover first, second, etc.) in the introduction for added clarity.

**2. Use of Quotations**
- You incorporate *a lot* of direct quotes, sometimes lengthy ones. While quoting primary texts is good, be sure to paraphrase and then use shorter quotes to back up your summaries. Reserve block quotes for truly pivotal passages.
- After quoting, make sure you explain the significance of the quote in your own words. At times, you rely on the quote to carry the argument.

**3. Depth of Analysis**
- Your summaries are thorough, but sometimes the analysis is a bit thin. For example, in places where you note the “roadblocks” to public benevolence for Hume, you might elaborate: How persuasive are his arguments? Are there objections or limitations to his view?
- When contrasting public and private benevolence in Hume, or resentment and hatred in Smith, consider exploring potential objections or alternative readings.

**4. Stylistic Considerations**
- The prose is generally clear, but some sentences are long and could be broken up for readability.
- A few transitions could be stronger where you move from summary to analysis (e.g., “At this point,” “Consider now,” etc.—try more varied phrases).
- Watch for minor grammatical slips and proofread for typos and awkward phrasing (“it is not the outcome, it is the motive behind the action” would flow better as “it is not the outcome, but the motive behind the action”).

**5. Critical Engagement**
- Consider offering your own evaluative comments. Do you think one thinker offers a more compelling account? Is there potential for synthesis? What are the practical implications?
- Critical engagement could be as simple as noting a possible contemporary application, or questioning whether Hume’s ‘artificial convention’ still explains how societies create justice today.

**6. Citations and Formatting**
- While you credit primary sources in the bibliography, it’s not clear from your internal text where each quotation or close paraphrase comes from. Use parenthetical citations or footnotes for clarity.
- The bibliography is solid, but check for consistency in formatting style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.), if your professor requires a particular one.

### **Suggestions for Revision**

- **Rewrite Your Introduction:** Make your thesis more explicit. E.g.: "While both Hume and Smith agree that society depends on rules of justice, their accounts reflect fundamentally different sources and mechanisms for moral motivation. This paper argues that Smith’s focus on warranted resentment and impartiality addresses key shortcomings in Hume’s conventionalist approach."
- **Add More Analysis:** After summarizing each philosopher, take a paragraph to weigh their strengths and weaknesses.
- **Shorten Quotations:** Paraphrase more, and save direct quotes for when the primary text says something particularly distinctive or ambiguous.
- **Add In-Text Citations:** Make it clear where each idea or quotation comes from.
- **Expand on the Comparison:** Explore *consequences* of their differences—how do their views affect how we ought to structure society, enforce justice, etc.?
- **Conclude with a Stronger Statement:** Your conclusion could more forcefully state what’s at stake, or why this comparison matters (historically, or for modern issues).

### **Summary**

**You’ve written a solid, clear, and insightful comparison of Hume and Smith on justice, and you demonstrate a command of the philosophical materials.** Polish the prose where you can, foreground your thesis and own critical voice a bit more, and smooth out your use of quotations. These steps will move your paper from a strong, well-informed summary to a top-tier piece of undergraduate philosophy.
