## Feedback on Your Essay

### **Strengths**
1. **Thorough Analysis:**  
   Your essay provides a thoughtful and well-supported argument about gender roles in the *Oresteia*, effectively challenging traditional assumptions of masculinity and femininity in Ancient Greek literature.
2. **Textual Evidence:**  
   You draw on a range of primary sources (Aeschylus, Euripides, Hesiod) and secondary scholarship, integrating quotations and page numbers to support your points. This strengthens your arguments and demonstrates close reading.
3. **Clear Structure:**  
   The essay is logically organized: each paragraph tackles a central idea, with transitions that help guide the reader through your analysis of different characters.
4. **Comparative Approach:**  
   The connection between *Oresteia* and *Hecuba* broadens your discussion and adds depth by showing trends across different works and authors, not just Aeschylus.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    - Some sentences are long and complex, occasionally making your argument harder to follow. Breaking up lengthy sentences or simplifying language would enhance clarity.
    - Example: “Her line of argumentation eventually cracks through Agamemnon’s thin layer of reason, painting a picture of Agamemnon as physically strong but mentally weak.” This could be shortened: “Clytemnestra’s arguments break Agamemnon’s resolve, showing him as physically strong but mentally weak.”

2. **Thesis Placement and Development:**
    - The thesis statement would be clearer if stated more explicitly at the beginning. Sometimes your main argument (that female characters embody “masculine” virtues more than male characters) is not immediately apparent or gets repeated rather than developed.
    - Suggestion: Conclude the first paragraph with a direct thesis clarifying your position.

3. **Secondary Scholarship Engagement:**
    - You cite scholars such as Lloyd-Jones and Wilmer, but mostly to reinforce your points. Occasionally, engage with them more critically—do you agree or disagree? Does your reading extend or challenge their claims?
 
4. **Balance in Character Analysis:**
    - The essay’s focus is primarily on Clytemnestra, with Cassandra and Athene covered more briefly. Consider deepening the analysis of Cassandra and Athene, or clarify why Clytemnestra’s case is most revealing.

5. **Conclusion:**
    - The conclusion is effective but could be stronger by addressing the implications of your argument. For example, what might this reading suggest about how we understand gender today, or the cultural significance of Greek drama more broadly?

### **Minor Stylistic Notes**
- **Quotations:** When you reference a text, clarify whether you’re quoting directly or paraphrasing.
- **Punctuation and Grammar:** A few minor grammatical issues (“fight backs” → “fights back”) and wordiness can be edited for a more polished paper.
- **Citation Style:** Ensure consistency between in-text citations and Works Cited.

## **Sample Revised Thesis**
Original:  
“However, after examining in more detail the opposition of male vs. female amongst the characters in the Oresteia it is clear that the female characters embody the positive characteristics which are stereotypically associated with men in Ancient Greek society.”

**Revision:**  
“In the *Oresteia*, Aeschylus crafts female characters who subvert traditional gender roles, presenting them as more rational, courageous, and powerful than their male counterparts—thereby challenging the normative dichotomy of masculine and feminine virtues in Ancient Greek society.”

## **Overall Assessment**
This is a strong, well-researched essay that engages deeply with primary texts and scholarship. A little more precision in language, a clearer thesis up top, and some additional engagement with secondary sources will make it even stronger. Your insights into the non-traditional gender dynamics in Greek tragedy are convincing and compelling.

**Well done!** If you want a more detailed paragraph edit or a sample rewrite of a section, just let me know!
