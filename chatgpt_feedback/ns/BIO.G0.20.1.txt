Absolutely, here is a detailed feedback on your paper, **"A Case for a US International Anti-Malaria Program"**:

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Clear Structure**
You have organized the paper very clearly, dividing it into logical sections including the nature of malaria, the state of the problem, control methods, the case for US involvement, and cost/benefit analysis. This structure makes it easy to follow your arguments.

### 2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
Your paper covers the scientific, historical, economic, and political aspects of malaria and its control. The historical overview of anti-malaria efforts in the US, as well as the reasoning for a renewed international effort, shows a good grasp of the topic.

### 3. **Use of Evidence and Sources**
You support your points well with statistics, reputable sources, and references. The use of cost/benefit ratios, productivity impacts, and policy comparisons provides a strong, quantitative foundation for your advocacy.

### 4. **Balanced Consideration**
You recognize hurdles such as drug and insecticide resistance, funding limitations, and logistical challenges associated with prevention strategies. This shows a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.

### 5. **Persuasive Policy Argument**
Your argument for renewed American leadership and funding is logical and persuasive. The comparison to HIV/AIDS funding and to the Iraq War spending is effective in putting proposed spending in perspective for the reader.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Citation Style and Consistency**
- The referencing style is inconsistent; sometimes sources are footnoted in the text, sometimes simply mentioned. For clarity and professionalism, consider adopting a uniform citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).
- Some in-text references (like "Ibid") may confuse readers not familiar with the source, especially outside a bibliography context.

### 2. **Clarity and Brevity**
- Some sentences are longer and more complex than necessary, which may reduce clarity ("Additionally efforts at eliminating the mosquito population have proven successful in some areas of the world. The gradual elimination of wetlands in the United States and Europe eliminated many of the mosquitoes' breeding grounds, and it is thought this may work in endemic areas as well."). Consider breaking up into shorter sentences and avoiding redundancy.
- Watch for minor typos or grammatical errors (e.g., "theses officials" should be "these officials").

### 3. **Depth of Counter-Arguments**
- While you mention barriers and challenges, the piece may benefit from more explicit discussion of possible criticisms or limitations of a US-led international program, such as issues with sovereignty, cultural resistance, or the risk of unintended environmental impacts (e.g., from DDT use). Then, you could address or rebut these concerns.

### 4. **Visual Aids/Figures**
- For a report with many statistics, consider (where permitted) adding simple tables, graphs, or maps illustrating prevalence, costs, or projected benefits. While not always required, visuals can enhance understanding and retention.

### 5. **Policy Recommendations**
- You advocate for increased US involvement, but your argument could be strengthened by more specific, actionable recommendations or a brief summary of steps (e.g., how funds should be allocated, what agencies should coordinate, partnerships, monitoring & evaluation frameworks).

### 6. **Conclusion**
- Your paper seems to lack a distinct concluding section. A short, forceful conclusion would help to sum up your arguments and leave the reader with a call to action or a memorable final point.

## **Smaller Suggestions**

- Some of your footnotes could be summarized in the main text for better readability.
- Specify more clearly what 'costs' and 'benefits' include (e.g., only health sector costs? Broader economic benefits?).
- When discussing potential benefits (like countries becoming trade partners or allies), a caveat or acknowledgment of complexity would improve credibility.

## **Overall Assessment**

This is a well-researched, strongly-argued, and clearly organized policy paper with a solid grasp of both science and policy. With some tightening of prose, improved referencing, and a stronger finish, this would be suitable for a high-level undergraduate or even graduate-level policy course.

**Grade Estimate:** Strong B+/A- range, easily moving higher with topical improvements listed above.
