## Overall Impression

This is a strong undergraduate research paper exhibiting a solid understanding of limnology, zooplankton ecology, and the potential anthropogenic impacts on freshwater ecosystems. You demonstrate clear research objectives, a solid methodological approach, and thoughtful interpretation of your results. The structure adheres to standard scientific writing conventions and is generally logical and coherent.

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Organization & Structure**
- The paper is well-organized, following the conventional sections: Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and References.
- Each section’s content is appropriate and transitions well to the next.

### 2. **Comprehensive Literature Review**
- The Introduction does a great job summarizing key literature, relevant ecological concepts (size-efficiency hypothesis, predator-prey dynamics, refuges, etc.), and justifying the rationale for the study.
- Citations are extensive and relevant.

### 3. **Defined Research Question**
- The objective—understanding the influence of lakeshore development and related limnological changes on zooplankton communities—is clearly articulated.

### 4. **Methodological Detail**
- The Methods section is detailed and reproducible, covering site selection, sampling, laboratory techniques, and statistical analyses.
- Use of established methodologies lends credibility (e.g., use of GIS for lake selection, refuge definition per Tessier & Welser).

### 5. **Data Analysis**
- Results are clearly presented, with appropriate use of statistics (correlations, regression).
- Interpretation adheres to what the data can support.

### 6. **Critical Discussion**
- Discussion addresses not just findings but also alternative explanations, potential confounders, methodological limitations, and suggestions for future research.
- You relate your findings back to ecological theory and existing studies.

## Areas for Improvement & Suggestions

### 1. **Depth & Breadth of Analysis**
- **Statistical Power**: With 20 lakes, some correlations lack significance. A brief note on statistical power and limitations due to sample size would be appropriate.
- **Data Visualization**: The text references figures (e.g., Figures 1-6), which are not included in the provided text. Ensure that all figures are present, readable, and clearly labeled in the actual submission.
- **Tables & Summaries**: While Table 1 is summarized, other summaries (such as for taxa compositions) could be beneficial.

### 2. **Clarity & Conciseness**
- **Wordiness**: Some paragraphs, particularly in the Introduction, could be made more concise. Streamlining sentences would aid readability.
- **Technical Terminology**: Occasionally, technical terms are used without immediate explanation (e.g., “critical depth” appears before being defined). Always define specialized terms at first use for broad accessibility.

### 3. **Hypothesis Framing**
- You mention being interested in the effects of residential development on zooplankton, but a more explicit, testable hypothesis in the Introduction (e.g., “I hypothesize that higher shoreline development leads to lower water clarity and smaller-bodied zooplankton.”) would strengthen the paper.

### 4. **Consideration of Confounding Factors**
- While the focus is on shoreline development, you astutely note the lack of fish community data. Expanding on how this limits your ability to assign causality (i.e., distinguishing direct anthropogenic impacts from those mediated by fish community alterations) would be valuable.

### 5. **Discussion of Negative Results**
- The lack of strong relationships between dwelling density and most zooplankton metrics is important. Consider discussing potential explanations in more depth—are dwelling counts an adequate proxy for eutrophication/nutrient input? Are there lakes that are outliers or exceptions, and can you speculate as to why?

### 6. **Broader Implications**
- The study is framed locally (southern Michigan), but some sentences could more explicitly extrapolate the findings to broader contexts, or reference similar findings/differing results in other regions.

### 7. **Minor Issues**
- Typos: There are minor typographical errors (e.g., “comprised” should be “composed” in scientific writing, according to some style guides).
- Citation Consistency: Ensure all in-text citations match the full literature cited section and are formatted per your target journal or instructor’s guidelines.

## Summary Statement

**This is a well-conducted and well-written undergraduate research paper. With minor improvements in clarity, more explicit hypothesis framing, and expanded discussion of limitations and negative results, it could serve as an excellent model for future ecology students.**
