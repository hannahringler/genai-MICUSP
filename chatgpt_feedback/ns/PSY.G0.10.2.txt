Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on the argumentative essay advocating for funding new computers in a school setting. This feedback covers strengths, areas for improvement, organization, use of evidence, and writing style.

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Argument & Purpose:**  
   The main argument—that the school board should propose a millage to buy new computers—is clearly stated from the outset. The purpose of the paper remains consistent throughout.

2. **Well-Structured Paragraphs:**  
   Each paragraph has a clear topic and supports the overall thesis. The essay introduces multiple benefits of computer use: individualized instruction, improved achievement, increased motivation, and real-world engagement.

3. **Relevant Examples & Evidence:**  
   You reference several research-supported examples, such as the Belvedere system, the Peabody Learning Lab, and Global Lab. These examples add credibility and demonstrate familiarity with educational technology.

4. **Integration of Research:**  
   The essay appropriately cites sources, showing engagement with the scholarly literature and providing a basis for claims.

5. **Balanced Consideration:**  
   There's mention that teachers must thoughtfully select appropriate programs, showing an understanding that technology implementation requires careful planning.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Thesis Statement:**  
   Although the main argument is clear, the thesis could be sharper—perhaps including a brief preview of key supporting points (e.g., “…because individualized instruction, academic achievement, and engagement all improve when students have access to modern technology”).

2. **Depth of Counterarguments:**  
   The essay doesn’t address potential drawbacks or counterarguments (e.g., cost concerns, teacher training, overreliance on technology). Acknowledging and rebutting one or two opposing views can make the argument stronger and more nuanced.

3. **Specifics About Implementation:**  
   More details on *how* increased computer access will be managed, maintained, and integrated (e.g., professional development for teachers or ensuring equitable access) would strengthen your case.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The conclusion is positive and forward-looking but a bit brief. Consider restating your main argument and summarizing the main benefits before the final sentence.

5. **Transitions:**  
   While the paper is generally well organized, transitions between paragraphs can be made smoother. Each paragraph should clearly link to the previous one to help the essay flow more naturally.

**Organization & Clarity:**

- The essay is logically organized, moving from individual benefits to broader, real-world engagement.
- Sentences are generally clear, though a few are long and could be split for clarity (especially in the first page).

**Use of Evidence:**

- The use of varied examples is strong. Whenever possible, connect specific research findings back to your main argument more explicitly.
- In-text citations are present, but some in-text discussion of the author or the study can make the evidence even more compelling.

**Writing Style:**

- The tone is formal and appropriate for an academic audience.
- Minor errors: One or two awkward phrases or small typographical errors, but these do not significantly distract from meaning.
- The phrase “our children will thank us…” could be more formal or specific to match the academic tone.

**Summary of Suggestions:**

1. Strengthen the thesis to preview your main supports.
2. Address at least one possible counterargument.
3. Provide more specific details on implementation and potential challenges.
4. Expand and refine your conclusion.
5. Use smoother transitions between ideas and paragraphs.

---

**Overall Assessment:**
This is a well-reasoned and well-supported argumentative essay. With added depth on potential challenges, more explicit thesis structure, and a slightly more thorough conclusion, it would be even stronger.

**Score (if needed, out of 10):**  
8/10 – Strong argument and research support, with room to improve in counterargument depth, specificity, and structure.
