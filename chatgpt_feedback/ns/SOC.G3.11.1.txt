Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your research proposal: **"Institutional Investor Activism on Climate Risk Disclosure: Frame Negotiation in an Organizational Field"**.

---

## Overall Impressions

**Strengths:**  
- The proposal is highly ambitious and well-structured.  
- Research questions are clearly articulated.  
- Shows a strong command of relevant literature/theories and places the research in an important, emerging field.  
- The outlined methodology is thorough and demonstrates understanding of qualitative methods.  
- Selection of sites and samples is logical.  
- The proposal displays awareness of both theoretical and practical significance.

**Weaknesses / Areas for Improvement:**  
- The research design, while rich, may over-promise in terms of breadth and depth (feasibility concerns given number of interviews, archival work, and breadth of perspectives).
- The proposal would be strengthened by further clarifying some concepts and anticipated analytical approaches.
- More explicit mention of potential limitations, obstacles (e.g., access, response bias, etc.), and how these will be dealt with would be helpful.
- Some framing is a bit dense for a proposal; consider briefly simplifying or clarifying dense theoretical sections for accessibility.
- The narrative could benefit from signposting and tighter summaries at the ends of major sections to keep the reader oriented.

## Detailed Feedback

### Title & Introduction

**Strengths:** Clear and reads like an academic article. Research questions are introduced up front.

**Suggestions:**  
- Consider a one-to-two sentence summary at the outset explaining why climate risk disclosure is a timely and important topic for sociology and/or organizational research.

### Literature Review/Theoretical Justification

**Strengths:**  
- Sophisticated engagement with theories: corporate control, organization theory, framing, and social movement theory.
- Does well to justify "why institutional investors?" and signal the field's diversity.

**Suggestions:**  
- The distinction between frames could be presented more concisely.
- Brief explanations of core terms like "organizational fields," "frames," and "enabling mechanisms" would help readers less familiar with the literature.
- Consider a paragraph that connects these theoretical approaches more explicitly (e.g., how does framing link to field theory, and what does this bring to the question that prior work misses?).

### Research Questions

**Strengths:**  
- Two central and well-articulated questions.
- Sub-questions provide helpful structure.

**Suggestions:**  
- Make research questions stand out visually (e.g., enumerating or italicizing) for easier reference.

### Methodology/Site/Sample

**Strengths:**  
- Clear explanation of site choice and how interviews will be selected.
- Good diversity in sampling (participants, non-participants, counter-movement).
- Practical dimensions (e.g., telephone interviews as backup) are thoughtfully considered.

**Suggestions:**  
- 55 interviews is a large number for a lone researcher, especially if also engaging in archival work. Consider whether a more focused sample would allow for greater depth (especially if data saturation occurs earlier).
- What is your backup plan if access is limited? How will non-response or refusals be handled?
- Anticipate and discuss challenges of self-presentation, gatekeeping, or access to sensitive archival materials.

### Potential Analytic Approaches

**Strengths:**  
- Questions suggest a framework for data analysis (frames, enabling mechanisms, field-level negotiations).

**Suggestions:**  
- Outline in a paragraph or two how collected data will be coded/analyzedâ€”are you doing grounded theory, discourse analysis, frame analysis, etc.?
- How will you triangulate archival materials and interviews?

### Contribution, Limitations, and Implications

**Strengths:**  
- Ends with strong claims for practical and theoretical significance.

**Suggestions:**  
- Add explicit discussion of anticipated limitations (e.g., generalizability, selection bias, roadblocks in data access).
- Consider specifying how findings might be useful to practitioners, not just for oral history but also for influencing policy or organizational practice.

## Additional Minor Suggestions

- Double-check for typographical/grammatical issues; overall very clean, but since this is a proposal, clarity and readability are especially important.
- Consider organizing appendices and references in a standard style (APA, Chicago, etc.) for consistency.

## Overall Evaluation

**Excellent proposal** with a sophisticated command of theory and methodology. With some tightening up (particularly regarding scope, analytic plan, and limitations), this could become a very strong dissertation or article-length study. Good luck with your research!
