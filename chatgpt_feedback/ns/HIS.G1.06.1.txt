Certainly! Below is detailed feedback on your response paper. I address structure and organization, analytical depth, use of evidence, engagement with sources, style and clarity, and areas to strengthen.

### Overall Impression

Your paper is intellectually ambitious and well-structured. You synthesize complex historiographical arguments and engage in meaningful criticism of Jon T. Coleman’s and Richard White’s works. Your writing demonstrates a keen understanding of the nuances of human-animal interaction in American history and skillfully connects primary texts and secondary interpretations. You also signal an awareness of broader questions in environmental and cultural history.

## Strengths

### 1. **Argument and Thesis**
- **Clear Position:** You present a thoughtful central critique: Coleman’s interpretation of human-wolf relationships is both illuminating and, at times, too static or narrowly drawn. You support this with well-chosen examples and counterarguments, including White’s “The Cultural Landscape of the Pawnee.”
- **Dialectical Approach:** You do not simply summarize but actively critique, question, and seek alternative explanations or extensions.

### 2. **Structure & Organization**
- **Coherent Flow:** Each paragraph and section logically builds on the previous, creating a smooth flow from summary to analysis to critique.
- **Sectional Focus:** You break the topics into discrete sections (folklore, violence, communication, cultural change) and integrate evidence within each.

### 3. **Analytical Depth**
- **Nuanced Readings:** You engage seriously with Coleman’s use of primary sources (folklore, Bibles, sermons) and analytical concepts (communication, symbolism, violence).
- **Historiographical Awareness:** You make good use of other historians (e.g., Jill Lepore, Richard White) to problematize or contextualize Coleman’s arguments, not just cite them.

### 4. **Evidence and Citation**
- **Rich Textual Evidence:** You support claims by citing specific page numbers and examples from both Coleman and White.
- **Good Integration of Direct Quotes:** This shows command of the material and provides authority to your interpretations.

### 5. **Clarity and Style**
- **Clear Prose:** Your writing is clear, professional, and free from grammatical or stylistic error. Sentences are varied and engaging.
- **Sophisticated Vocabulary:** You use discipline-appropriate terminology (“redemptive violence,” “cultural stasis,” “symbolic currency,” etc.) effectively.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Thesis Focus and Signposting**
- **Strengthen Your Central Claim:** While your thesis is strong, it could be more explicit in the introduction and conclusion—state more directly what your overarching critique is (e.g., “Coleman’s analysis is innovative but ultimately too one-dimensional regarding cultural change…”).
- **Stronger Topic Sentences:** Sometimes, points are buried in the paragraph. Try to make topic sentences directly point to your analytical or evaluative stance.

### 2. **Comparative Analysis**
- **Deepen White Comparison:** The engagement with White is thoughtful, but more comparative analysis would help. For instance, explicitly discuss how White’s arguments about cultural adaptation can—or cannot—apply to settler communities discussed by Coleman.
- **More on Indigenous Perspectives:** You mention alternative Indigenous interpretations but often return quickly to the settler perspective. Consider whether you might expand on these differences further.

### 3. **Theoretical Framing**
- **Explicit Theory Discussion:** Engage more overtly with theoretical frameworks—e.g., environmental history, animal studies, or “Darntonian moments”—to frame your assessment of Coleman’s approach as, perhaps, exemplary or limited within these traditions.

### 4. **Modern Connections**
- **Current-Day Comparison:** Your discussion of present-day wolf politics is strong, but consider tying it back even more clearly to the main themes—how does this continuity (or lack thereof) impact the usefulness of Coleman’s model?

### 5. **Conclusion**
- **Sharper Restatement:** Your conclusion is thoughtful but could reiterate your critique and final assessment more forcefully, perhaps connecting to the importance of animal agency or cultural fluidity in historical scholarship.

## Minor Suggestions
- **Transitional Sentences:** Occasionally, transitions between critiques (especially when moving from one historian to another) could be smoother.
- **Footnote Consistency:** Ensure citations are consistently formatted, especially when quoting or referencing secondary literature.

## Final Assessment

**This is an excellent analytic response that not only engages closely with the texts, but also advances the conversation by comparing different historical approaches and questioning dominant interpretive models. With a more forthright thesis, deeper comparative engagement with White, and a sharper final restatement, this could be a model response for a graduate seminar.**
