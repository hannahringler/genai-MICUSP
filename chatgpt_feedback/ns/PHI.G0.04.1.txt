Absolutely! This is an advanced undergraduate paper engaging with central debates in utilitarian and deontological moral theory. Here’s a thorough critique focusing on argumentation, structure, clarity, philosophical engagement, and style.

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Clear Engagement with Sources**
- The paper cites an impressive array of major philosophers (Hospers, Gibbard, Foot, Thompson, Scheffler, Williams, Nielsen), and integrates these references at relevant points of the argument.

### 2. **Philosophical Sophistication**
- The paper goes beyond summary, analyzing the implications and limitations of key utilitarian concepts like act- vs. rule-utilitarianism, the principle of universality, and agent-specific vs. common good obligations.
- You display strong grasp of advanced ethical nuances, especially in the transition from utilitarian to deontological considerations (negative rights, agent-centered restrictions).

### 3. **Use of Examples**
- The use of Gibbard’s corporate fraud scenario is effective. The analogy with gambling and the drowning child help illustrate abstract points.

### 4. **Independent Thought**
- The argument is not just a synthesis of sources, but works towards an original position: that agent-specific negative claims should override general positive claims, using Thompson’s and Foot’s distinctions.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Structure and Organization**
- **Transitions:** Some transitions between major points and philosophers are abrupt. Consider signposting key shifts: e.g., “Having considered Hospers’s critique, I now turn to...”
- **Thesis Placement:** While your views become clear in the final pages, it would help to clearly state your central thesis or aim in the introduction and remind the reader of this periodically.
- **Section Headings:** For clarity in a dense paper like this, headings (or at least paragraph breaks signaling shifts—e.g., “Objection from Consent,” “The Doing/Allowing Distinction”) would aid navigation.

### 2. **Argumentation**
- **Objection Response Cycle:** While you respond to utilitarian defenses and objections, more explicit consideration of the main counter-arguments against your own thesis would strengthen the paper. For instance:
  - What if someone denies that negative rights are always stronger or more specific than positive rights?
  - Why not see all rights (positive or negative) as lacking moral force when the stakes (numbers involved) get large enough?
- **Clarity on Claims:** The distinction between “having a claim *against* a harm” and “having a claim *on* a specific agent” is central to your conclusion, but is introduced relatively late and could use more scaffolding earlier in the paper.

### 3. **Clarity and Style**
- **Dense Sentences:** Some sentences run long and could be broken up for clarity. Example:
  - _“However, other employees’ positive claims may be. Consequently, because Martha’s coworkers have a specific claim over her restraint from forcing risk upon them, while the employees of other firms have a merely general claim over everyone...”_
  - This could be split and clarified: “By contrast, the employees of other firms have only a general positive claim on everyone. Martha’s coworkers, however, have a specific claim on her: she must not subject them, in particular, to risk without consent.”
- **Terms:** Define specialized terms (e.g., “agent-centered restrictions,” “negative rights”) when first used for maximum clarity.
- **Quotation Integration:** Sometimes you drop in quotes with little introduction. For instance, when citing Foot or Thompson, say more about why the passage is significant or controversial before or after quoting.

### 4. **Depth of Philosophical Reflection**
- **Doing vs. Allowing:** The paper gestures at but does not unpack the deep controversy about whether doing harm ("making worse-off") is always morally worse than allowing harm. Some critics of this distinction argue it collapses under scrutiny. Addressing this would strengthen the case.
- **Impersonal vs. Personal Moral Reasoning:** The challenge from Williams is stated, but could be fleshed out further: how do we weigh the “personal projects” of the agent against moral obligations?

## **Minor Issues**
- **Citation Style:** Inline parenthetical citations, or footnotes, rather than end notes, would be easier for a reader in an academic setting.
- **Page Numbers/Presentation:** The text includes page numbers and metadata from the corpus, which, if submitting for class, should be removed.

| Strength                                                         | Improvement Needed                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Excellent use of philosophical sources                           | More explicit thesis and roadmapping                             |
| Deep engagement with moral theory                                | Smoother transitions and clearer structure                       |
| Original philosophical synthesis                                 | More nuanced treatment of “negative vs. positive” claims         |
| Effective examples and cases                                     | Addressing main objections directly to your conclusion           |
| Clear understanding of both utilitarian and deontological views  | Explicate technical terms earlier and more clearly               |

## **Overall Assessment**

This is **ambitious, well-researched, and philosophically mature** work, well above average for an undergraduate paper. With more focus on organization, explicit argument mapping, and engaging with the hardest objections to your conclusion, it could be the basis of a very strong honors thesis or publishable undergraduate essay.

**Final tip:** Try writing a one-paragraph abstract stating your thesis (“In this paper I argue that…”), primary arguments, and main philosophical stakes. This will clarify both for you and your reader what to expect, and help organize the structure.
