Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, considering clarity, content, structure, and writing style:

---

**STRENGTHS:**

1. **Comprehensive Overview**: You provide a thorough overview of the context, history, and current debates around renewable fuels and energy policy in the 110th Congress. You effectively identify the positions of major stakeholders (Ethanol/Renewable Fuels Society, Petroleum Industry, Environmental Groups, President, Livestock and Poultry Industry) with supporting details.

2. **Use of Evidence**: You cite specific legislative bills (H.R. 6, H.R. 3221) and provide concrete figures, such as proposed RFS increases and campaign contributions. This adds credibility to your arguments.

3. **Balanced Perspective**: The paper strives for balance by presenting multiple sides of the debate, noting both benefits and concerns regarding renewable fuels mandates.

4. **Topical Relevance**: The issue is presented as timely and relevant to contemporary policy discussions, linking legislative action to broader economic, environmental, and social stakes.

**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:**

1. **Clarity and Organization**
   - **Transitions/Flow:** While you cover a lot of material, sections sometimes feel abrupt or disconnected. Use clearer topic sentences and transition phrases to guide the reader. For example, “On the other hand,” or “In contrast,” can signal shifts in perspective.
   - **Section Headings:** Consider using actual headings (e.g., “1. Ethanol Industry Perspective”, “2. Petroleum Industry Response”, “3. Environmental Groups”, etc.) for easier navigation.
   - **Summary/Conclusion:** The paper ends somewhat abruptly. Close with a summarizing paragraph restating the significance of the issue, the complexity of reconciling stakeholder interests, and possibly your own brief analysis on the likely outcome or your recommendation.

2. **Analysis vs. Summary**
   - **More Critical Analysis:** While you summarize stakeholder positions well, you could push your analysis further. For example, explain *why* certain actors have more influence, how lobbying shapes policy outcomes, or what trade-offs Congress faces. Consider adding your own evaluative voice.
   - **Implications:** What are the broader implications if the legislation passes as written, or if it fails?

3. **Source Integration & Citations**
   - **Attribution:** While you reference some sources, in places you mention facts or claims (e.g., “Ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 39-46%”) that should be directly cited. Consider using in-text citations throughout.
   - **Consistency:** The citation format is inconsistent (and sometimes absent). Pick a citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago) and apply it consistently.

4. **Writing Style**
   - **Grammar/Word Choice:** There are a few grammatical lapses. For example:  
     - “There is homogenous support among the groups supporting the 2007 Energy Policy…” (Consider: “There is broad support among these groups for the 2007 Energy Policy…”)
     - “Ethanol producers have motives from such stipulations as…” should be “Ethanol producers are motivated by stipulations such as…”
   - **Avoid Editorializing without Evidence:** Phrases like “It is interesting that President Bush is so supportive…” could be strengthened by referencing sources or providing context, not just personal observation.

5. **Formatting/Mechanics**
   - Remove the repeated footer (“Michigan Corpus…” etc.) from the text body.
   - The presentation of numbers (e.g., “$931,000”) is clear, but make sure this is consistently formatted.

**EXAMPLES OF CONCRETE REVISIONS:**

**Original:**  
“Senator Bingaman (D-NM) proposed an increase in the renewable fuels standard (RFS) to 36 billion gallons until 2022 from 2005 standards of 7.5 billion gallons in 2012. There is debate over the need to increase the RFS because currently ethanol producers are already above standard production and questions about the US’s ability to produce the required amount remain a concern.”

**Suggested:**  
“Senator Bingaman (D-NM) has proposed raising the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) to 36 billion gallons by 2022, a substantial increase from the 2005 benchmark of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. This proposal is controversial: while some ethanol producers have already exceeded existing targets, there are persistent concerns about the U.S. industry’s capacity to sustainably meet these new production goals.”

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**

This is an informative and well-researched report that demonstrates a solid grasp of the key actors and conflicts in contemporary U.S. energy policy. To strengthen the paper, focus on organization, consistency in citation, transitions, and add a compelling summary or conclusion. Deepen your critical analysis where possible and polish your writing for clarity and grammar. With these improvements, your paper will stand out even more!
