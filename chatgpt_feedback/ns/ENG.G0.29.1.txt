Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your essay, "Good People Breaking Rules: Etiquette in *Pride and Prejudice* and *Evelina*":

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Thesis:**  
   Your thesis is well-defined: both novels show that etiquette alone is not a reliable indicator of personal worth; what really matters is genuine goodness or integrity. This argument frames the paper effectively.

2. **Textual Analysis:**  
   You provide strong textual evidence to back up your assertions, such as Evelina’s nervous dialogue or specific interactions between Elizabeth Bennet and Lady Catherine. Quoting directly from the texts adds weight to your analysis.

3. **Organization:**  
   The essay is logically structured: you first discuss *Evelina*, contrasting her with Willoughby and Lord Orville, and then move to *Pride and Prejudice*, focusing on Elizabeth and Mr. Collins. The parallels you draw between the two works are effective.

4. **Balanced Character Comparisons:**  
   You insightfully compare and contrast characters who perform etiquette for selfish reasons (Willoughby, Mr. Collins) with those who embody true politeness (Orville, Elizabeth). This highlights your thesis clearly.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Your conclusion nicely summarizes your argument and provides a thoughtful take on the limitations of etiquette as societal measurement.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Depth of Analysis:**  
   While your textual references are well chosen, you may at times restate what happens rather than deeply interpreting why it matters or how it reflects broader themes. For example, you could further analyze why breaking etiquette becomes a signal of authentic selfhood in these novels, or what social commentary the authors may be providing.

2. **Engagement with Secondary Sources:**  
   The essay is strong in primary textual analysis but could be strengthened by engaging with critical perspectives or scholarship on etiquette, gender, or morality in these novels. Even 1-2 references to literary critics would enrich your analysis and show breadth of research.

3. **Transitions and Flow:**  
   Occasionally, the transitions between ideas or paragraphs are a bit abrupt. For example, when shifting from Willoughby to Orville or from *Evelina* to *Pride and Prejudice*, you might use clearer topic sentences or transition phrases to guide your reader.

4. **Grammar and Mechanics:**  
   Generally strong, but occasional small errors (“breech” instead of “breach”; “dong” instead of “doing”) distract slightly. Careful proofreading will polish your work.

5. **Introduction Framing:**  
   The introduction is clear and begins with a dictionary definition, which is acceptable, but could be more engaging. Consider starting with a thematic observation or an intriguing example from one of the novels to draw the reader in before defining etiquette.

6. **More about Consequences:**  
   When describing rule-breaking or adherence (especially for Evelina and Elizabeth), you could elaborate more on the social or emotional consequences for these characters and those around them.

**Suggestions for Revision:**

- Consider weaving in brief references to critics/commentators to place your analysis in a broader scholarly conversation.
- Expand your exploration of *why* etiquette is insufficient—what do these novels suggest should replace or supplement it in determining personal worth?
- Use more explicit transitions to guide the reader through your argument, especially when switching novels or character focuses.
- Vary your introduction, perhaps opening with a striking moment where etiquette fails rather than a dictionary definition.

**Overall Impression:**
This is a focused, insightful paper with a clear argument and thoughtful use of textual evidence. A few refinements—particularly adding scholarly context, deepening your analysis, and smoothing transitions—would elevate it to a higher level.
