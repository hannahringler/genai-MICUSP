## Overall Feedback

### **Strengths**

**1. Ambitious Scope and Comparative Approach:**  
The paper’s macro-comparative analysis between Southeast Asia and the United States is impressive and ambitious. It successfully highlights the global nature of environmental justice issues and demonstrates awareness of both regional specificity and broader patterns.

**2. Use of Case Studies:**  
The paper uses specific, well-cited case studies (e.g., Buttonwillow, Itogon, Convent, San Fernando, etc.) to illustrate its points, grounding larger arguments in concrete examples.

**3. Awareness of Complexity:**  
Acknowledges the complexities in environmental justice—e.g., unintentional vs. intentional discrimination; the interplay between government, industry, and marginalized communities; and differing forms of activism.

**4. Clear Structure:**  
The paper is logically organized into sections: introduction, background & procedure, problems, causes, outcomes, and conclusion. This enhances readability.

**5. Engagement with Literature:**  
Draws upon a wide range of sources, including both academic and NGO reports, providing evidence and scholarly grounding for key arguments.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### **1. Thesis and Framing**

- **Thesis Clarity:**  
  The main thesis—that Southeast Asian movements have stronger social/political linkages than the US and that the US could learn from them—comes through more clearly in the abstract and conclusion than in the body. Make sure to restate and clarify this throughout the sections, so the comparative argument is consistently foregrounded.

- **Definitional Rigour:**  
  Terms like “environmental justice,” “environmental racism,” and “environmental democracy” need clearer, more succinct definitions up front. Explain early how you’re using these concepts.

#### **2. Analysis and Depth**

- **Comparative Sharpness:**  
  The comparison sometimes feels descriptive rather than analytical. Push further to explain *why* differences or similarities occur (historical, political, economic, cultural factors) and *so what*—what implications do these findings have for global EJ movements or policy?

- **Missing Region/Nation Nuance:**  
  “Southeast Asia” is repeatedly used, but examples and literature referenced (e.g., Chipko movement, India) are from South Asia. Consider using “South & Southeast Asia” or clarifying why India is included in your regional frame, or focus solely on true Southeast Asian case studies (e.g., Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand).

- **US/Developing World Binary:**  
  There’s a risk of flattening both comparisons. “The US” and “Southeast Asia” are not monolithic. Diversity *within* regions (e.g., among US communities) could be acknowledged more, with a nod to differing trajectories and challenges.

#### **3. Sources and Evidence**

- **Recent Sources:**  
  The most recent citations are from the early 2000s. Consider reviewing newer literature on environmental justice, especially as the field has expanded significantly post-2005.

- **More Data and Outcomes:**  
  When discussing outcomes or “successes and failures,” offer more detail. For instance, did these movements succeed in stopping projects, or only in mitigating harm? Are there metrics of success/failure? What broader policy changes resulted, if any?

#### **4. Writing and Style**

- **Sentence Clarity:**  
  Some sentences are overly long or could be more concise. For example:
   - “Due to the nature of those targeted in environmental justice problems, the poor, minorities, and less fortunate; it is not surprising that those looking to scrape by from week to week would not seek to address an issue like water contamination or industrial expansion until the problem is figuratively in their back yard.”
  > Suggestion: Break into shorter sentences and clarify.

- **Paragraph Cohesion:**  
  Occasionally there’s a jump between ideas without transition. Ensure each paragraph begins with a topic sentence and builds logically from the previous one.

- **Proofreading:**  
  Minor typographical errors and awkward phrasing exist (e.g., “to side on that size of the issue,” likely means “side on that side of the issue”). Careful proofreading will help overall polish.

#### **5. Structure and Formatting**

- **Section Headers:**  
  The use of clear headers is helpful; ensure all are formatted consistently, and that each section delivers on what the header promises.

- **Conclusion:**  
  The conclusion nicely recaps the discussion, but could end with a clear, memorable final statement or call to action. What’s the broader significance (for policy, research, advocacy)?

## **Summary of Key Suggestions**
1. **Clarify and reinforce thesis and key terms throughout.**
2. **Deepen comparative analysis—explain “why” and “so what.”**
3. **Update and broaden source base, including more recent scholarship.**
4. **Acknowledge nuance and diversity within both the US and Southeast Asia.**
5. **Edit for clarity and cohesion.**
6. **Tighten the conclusion with a forward-looking statement.**

## **Final Assessment**

This is a strong undergraduate paper that shows considerable initiative and understanding of complex global issues. With more analytical depth, updated sources, and sharper writing, it could become a truly excellent essay or even the basis for further research. Good work overall—keep pushing for greater clarity, specificity, and analytical rigor!
