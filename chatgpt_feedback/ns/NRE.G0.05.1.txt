Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, “The Role of Corporations in the American Public Health Crisis Over Nutrition, Diet, and Diet Related Diseases.”

---

**Overall Impression**
Your paper presents a well-researched, critical analysis of the interplay between corporations, government regulation, and public health as it relates to the American diet. You effectively use academic and reputable sources such as Michael Pollan and Michele Simon, and integrate specific examples to illustrate your points. The overall writing is clear and shows evidence of critical thinking and synthesis of complex information.

### 1. Structure & Organization

**Strengths:**
- Introduction clearly frames the historical context (1977 Senate Committee) and frames the central dilemma.
- Each section logically builds on the previous one: history, corporate structure, failures of self-regulation, government role, and finally, solutions.
- Use of subheadings makes the paper easy to follow.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider adding a thesis statement at the introduction that clearly summarizes your argument.
- The title is clear and descriptive but could be made more concise. For example: “Corporate Influence, Government Policy, and America’s Diet-Related Health Crisis”.
- The transition from sections could be smoother. For example, the transition from discussing corporate structure to self-regulation could be more explicit.

### 2. Clarity & Style

**Strengths:**
- You strike a balance between a formal academic tone and readability.
- Repeatedly referring to examples strengthens your arguments.
- Definitions of key terms (like “nutriwashing”) are clear.

**Suggestions:**
- Some paragraphs, especially in the opening sections, are quite long. Consider breaking them into shorter paragraphs for easier reading.
- Watch for minor typos and wordiness (“never the less” → “nevertheless”, “managers who willfully allow the bottom line [of profit]…” can be tightened up).

### 3. Evidence & Argumentation

**Strengths:**
- Excellent use of sources; you cite Pollan, Simon, USDA guidelines, and industry ads.
- Good integration of quantitative data (e.g., the table of health claims on products).
- You recognize both sides of the debate (e.g., consumer choice vs. the need for regulation).

**Suggestions:**
- Occasionally, you could more explicitly analyze—rather than describe—your examples (e.g., why industry PR campaigns are so effective; more critical discussion).
- More discussion about the limitations or potential counterarguments to your position would strengthen your critical analysis.
- Try to avoid over-reliance on a single source per section, even when using authoritative authors. Cross-reference where possible.

### 4. Originality & Critical Thinking

**Strengths:**
- You’re not afraid to critique established institutions, and you identify contradictions in government guidelines.
- Highlighting the “nutrients vs. food” issue is insightful and less frequently discussed in basic nutrition discourse.

**Suggestions:**
- Expand more on possible solutions. You mention “eat food, not too much, mostly plants” and support for regulation, but more concrete policy recommendations or real-world examples of success (e.g., international cases) would add weight.

### 5. Use of Visuals & Appendix

**Strengths:**
- Including tables and advertisements strengthens your message and shows engagement with real-world examples.

**Suggestions:**
- Make sure to reference each figure directly in the text (“see Figure 1”) and briefly explain its relevance.
- Some figures (from Glamour) aren’t shown here. If possible, describe their content for readers who can’t view them.

### 6. Conclusion

**Strengths:**
- The conclusion is clear, reiterates your recommendations, and ties back to the introduction.

**Suggestions:**
- Strengthen your closing paragraph by more forcefully restating the stakes for public health and summarizing actionable points for policy or public awareness.

### 7. Citations & Formatting

**Strengths:**
- You properly cite a variety of sources and include a Works Cited section.
- Citation style is generally consistent.

**Suggestions:**
- Double-check all in-text citation formats for consistency (especially with direct quotes).
- Consider using an official citation style (MLA, APA, Chicago) as required by your instructor.
