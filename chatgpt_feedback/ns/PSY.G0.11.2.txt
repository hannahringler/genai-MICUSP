Absolutely! Here’s a structured feedback on the paper, looking at its strengths and possible areas for improvement:

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Descriptive Language & Imagery:**  
    - The paper uses vivid descriptions (e.g., “one gigantic marble slab,” “acts like arms trying to grab at something as you pass”) that help the reader clearly visualize the Clements Library.
    - Sensory details, such as the marble sidewalk being slippery, help the reader relate to the author’s physical experience of the building.

2. **Cohesive Structure/Organization:**  
    - The essay is logically organized: it starts with the writer’s personal experience, moves to an exterior architectural analysis, touches on landscaping and ambiance, and then returns to how the building affects the writer.
    - Each paragraph builds on the previous one, keeping a good flow.

3. **Thematic Consistency:**  
    - The consistent focus on the theme of “power” as conveyed by the library’s architecture provides the paper with a clear, unifying thread.
    - Connections to both classical and Gothic architecture are well made, showing some research and thought about architectural influence.

4. **Personal Reflection:**  
    - The inclusion of personal anecdotes (e.g., the avoidance behavior, the apprehension about the marble) adds depth and makes the analysis more engaging and relatable.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Thesis Statement/Introduction:**  
    - The introduction could do more to clearly state the main point or “thesis” of the paper. Right now, the first paragraph is engaging but doesn’t lay out exactly what the writer will argue or analyze.
    - Consider adding a sentence early on that says something like: “The William L. Clements Library’s architecture powerfully influences the emotions and behaviors of those who pass by, due to its imposing design and historical references.”

2. **Depth of Analysis:**  
    - The paper would benefit from a slightly deeper analysis. For example, why does referencing classical architecture produce a sense of power? What historical or psychological reasons might explain this common reaction to such design?
    - Consider briefly linking to wider architectural principles or studies (if allowed by assignment scope).

3. **Transitions and Flow:**  
    - While the organization is generally strong, some transitions between topics (e.g., from discussing the building itself to the landscaping, and then to the tree) could be smoother. Try using linking sentences to guide the reader (“In addition to its architecture, the grounds surrounding the library reinforce this sense of order and authority…”).

4. **Grammar and Word Choice:**  
    - Minor errors: “loose” should be “lose” in “has caused many people to loose their footing.”
    - Phrases like “remind back to” should be “harken back to.”
    - The phrase “make one associate the building with divinity and the power that gods held” could be more succinct.

5. **Conclusion:**  
    - While the conclusion wraps up the personal sentiment well, it could restate the larger significance or the main themes more explicitly. For example, emphasize how architecture shapes not only the campus environment but also the daily experiences of students.

**Overall Evaluation:**
- **Grade (if required):** B+/A-  
- A highly engaging and descriptive essay with strong personal voice and vivid imagery. With a more clearly stated thesis, smoother transitions, and a touch more analytic depth, it would become an even stronger observational/analytical piece.
