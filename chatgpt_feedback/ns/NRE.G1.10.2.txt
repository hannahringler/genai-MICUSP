Certainly! Here’s a comprehensive feedback on your paper entitled **“Assessment and Comparison of Five Different Michigan Streams”**:

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**  
   You address physical, chemical, and biological aspects of all five streams, providing a well-rounded view of each system. Each stream is discussed with clear reference to location, surrounding land use, and physiographic factors.

2. **Good Use of Comparative Structure**  
   You effectively compare northern and southern streams, citing specific reasons for differences in water quality and stream characteristics, such as land use, geology, and human impact.

3. **Integration of Data Sources**  
   The use of surveys, indices (HBI, Shannon-Weiner, Simpson’s), and chemical/nutrient measurements demonstrates a thorough analysis using a diverse set of tools.

4. **Logical Organization**  
   The flow, from discussing geology/physical factors to habitat assessment, biotic indices, and finally chemical characterization, helps readers follow your argument clearly.

5. **Balanced Discussion of Human Impact**  
   You highlight both negative (agricultural runoff, dam impacts) and positive (restoration/remediation at Oden) human influences, offering a nuanced analysis.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**  
   Some sentences are overly long or complex, occasionally making your points less clear. For example:  
   *“…The meanders had a regular artificial appearance to them, and the substrate appeared as if was gravel and sand purchased and placed in a very uniform manner throughout the stream.”*  
   Could be rewritten as:  
   *“The meanders appeared artificial, and the substrate seemed to consist of uniformly placed, purchased gravel and sand.”*  
   Aim for shorter sentences and avoid unnecessary qualifiers for crisper writing.

2. **Consistency in Data Reference**  
   You reference several tables and figures (e.g., table 3, fig. 4, fig. 5, table 1), but these are not provided in your text. For a reader without access to the full report, this is confusing. Either briefly summarize the figure/table key findings in text or provide them as appendices.

3. **Technical Jargon and Audience**  
   Some terms (e.g., M-F till, hydrograph, embeddedness, EPT) are introduced without definition. Consider giving a brief explanation for readers who might not be familiar with stream ecology terminology.

4. **Minor Issues with Grammar & Word Choice**  
   - Watch for missing words or small typos (e.g., “impart be attributed” should be “in part be attributed”).
   - Consistency with place names: “Flemming Creek” vs. “Fleming Creek.”
   - Sometimes redundant phrasing (“lack of good benthic habitat was another negative characteristic of this stream”).

5. **Depth of Analysis in Certain Areas**  
   While you mention some potential sampling bias at Oden, more critical discussion of the limitations of your methods/data (e.g., using 2004 fish data; not electroshocking at Oden; limited observation periods) would strengthen your analysis.

6. **Conclusion and Synthesis**  
   You do sum up well in your final paragraph, but consider ending with a stronger overall synthesis that ties the findings to broader environmental implications or management recommendations for Michigan streams.

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a solid, well-organized, and thoughtful comparative stream assessment. You effectively integrate multiple types of data and thoughtfully discuss the impact of land use and geology on stream health. With some tightening of language, added data context, and a bit more explanation of technical terms and potential limitations, your paper would be even stronger.

**Score estimate (if required):**
- Content: 9/10
- Organization: 8.5/10
- Clarity: 7.5/10
- Critical Analysis: 8/10
