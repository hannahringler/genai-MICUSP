Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, **“Give Me a Break! The English Double Object Construction.”** I’ve organized my feedback into the following categories: **Content & Argumentation, Structure & Organization, Clarity & Style, Use of Evidence & Citations, and Suggestions for Improvement.** If you want feedback on a specific section or aspect, let me know!

---

## 1. Content & Argumentation

### **Strengths**
- **Thorough Review of Literature:** You summarize key arguments and evidence from Barss & Lasnik (1986), Haegeman (1994), Chomsky (1995), and Larson (1988) in a way that demonstrates a solid understanding of the field’s debates.
- **Engagement with Data:** You engage closely with syntactic asymmetries, clearly laying out the core grammatical patterns and problems.
- **Critical Thinking:** You critically evaluate the proposals rather than just describing them. Your evaluation of Barss and Lasnik’s and Larson’s accounts is insightful, especially when you note the limits of their analyses.
- **Original Insight:** In the final sections, you offer thoughtful alternate derivations and raise interesting questions about productivity and construction grammar, showing creative and independent thinking.

### **Areas for Improvement**
- **Depth of Critique:** In some places, your critiques (especially of Larson’s theory) could be even more explicit—for example, state more clearly why a given assumption or derivation is theoretically or empirically problematic.
- **Explicit Framing of Your Proposal:** Your “own two cents” presents an alternative derivation and intuition, but it would be helpful to summarize clearly *what* your proposal is and *how* it improves on previous analyses. A brief "This proposal solves X, Y, and Z..." would strengthen your argument.

## 2. Structure & Organization

### **Strengths**
- **Logical Progression:** The structure moves logically from data, to previous explanations, to your evaluation, and finally to your own hypothesis.
- **Section Headings and Transitions:** You use headings (“A Problem: Asymmetry”, “Adjuncts and V' Reanalysis,” etc.) effectively to guide the reader through the discussion.

### **Areas for Improvement**
- **More Explicit Sectioning:** Although the headings are helpful, sometimes the transitions between explanation, critique, and your own ideas are dense. Consider explicit mini-summaries or roadmap sentences, especially at section transitions, to orient the reader.
- **Conclusion:** The conclusion section is brief and focused primarily on the productivity of the construction. It would be stronger if you also restated your central findings and their importance in relation to the broader theoretical debate.

## 3. Clarity & Style

### **Strengths**
- **Technical Accuracy:** You use syntactic and theoretical terminology correctly.
- **Engaging Tone:** Your writing is clear and, at places, witty (“some notational housekeeping”), which makes dense theory more accessible.
- **Tables and Diagrams:** You effectively include syntactic trees/diagrams, which are essential for argumentation in syntax papers.

### **Areas for Improvement**
- **Occasional Wordiness:** Some sentences are overly complex, which can obscure key points. Try to break up long sentences for clarity (e.g., especially when describing syntactic relationships).
- **Footnotes:** The footnotes are sometimes lengthy or tangential. Consider whether the information could be integrated into the main text, or trimmed for conciseness.

## 4. Use of Evidence & Citations

### **Strengths**
- **Careful Citation:** You systematically reference the sources for every key claim and data point—this is excellent scholarly practice.
- **Use of Examples:** You make good use of example sentences to illustrate points, including judgments about grammaticality.

### **Areas for Improvement**
- **Incorporate More Recent Literature (if space/assignment allows):** You primarily discuss classic works from the 1980s–1990s; a brief mention of subsequent research (even just a sentence) could situate your work in a broader context.
- **Clarify Source of Judgments:** For sentences marked as “in my idiolect,” you do well noting individual variation. If using your own judgments, clarify the methodology (even briefly).

---

## 5. Suggestions for Improvement

- **Highlight the Theoretical Stakes.** At the start and end of the paper, explicitly state why understanding double object constructions matters for syntactic theory as a whole (Case assignment, argument structure, etc.).
- **Clarify and Consolidate Your Proposal.** Distill your alternate proposals into a clear summary paragraph—what is your alternative, how is it derived, and how does it solve problems left open by previous theories?
- **Polish for Readability.** Shorten overly long sentences, move some footnote material into the text, and ensure your diagrams are integrated smoothly and referenced within the main argument.
- **Stronger Conclusion.** Don’t just raise new questions—recap what you have shown, and suggest next steps or open questions, linking back to your stated goals.

## **Summary**
Your paper is a robust, well-informed, and critical engagement with one of the trickiest problems in English syntax. With more explicit framing of your alternative proposal, a slightly stronger conclusion, and a careful eye for clarity, this could be an excellent graduate paper or even a publishable short squib with expansion and references to new work in the field.

**Great job! Is there a particular section you'd like more feedback on, or are you looking for tips on how to revise for publication or presentation?**
