Absolutely! Here is a comprehensive feedback for the paper titled **"External Analysis of the National Society of Black Engineers"** based on its content, organization, strengths, and potential areas for improvement:

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Clear Structure and Organization:**  
   The paper follows a logical format with sections including Executive Summary, Key Inputs, History, External Environment, Mission and Strategy, Outputs, Environmental Sensitivity, and Conclusion. Each section transitions smoothly into the next, which makes for an easy and coherent read.

2. **Depth of Analysis:**  
   The paper provides detailed insights into the organizational structure, external environment (task and general), and key trends affecting the NSBE chapter at the University of Michigan. Concepts from organizational theory (Daft’s model, Miles and Snow’s typology, Quinn’s competing values framework) are well-integrated into the analysis and demonstrate real academic engagement.

3. **Use of Concrete Examples:**  
   Throughout the paper, concrete activities, challenges, and solutions (e.g., the "Walk for Education", collaboration with SHPE, conference goal setting, Big Sib/Lil Sib mentoring program) are provided. These details bring theory into practice and show the real-world application of concepts.

4. **Analytical Balance:**  
   The paper does not shy away from discussing weaknesses or ongoing challenges (e.g., declining African-American enrollment, difficulty engaging graduate students, issues with 100% resource utilization). This critical self-awareness adds credibility to the analysis.

5. **Data-Informed:**  
   The paper supports its claims with quantitative data where relevant—for example, the drop in black engineering freshmen, specific membership goals, GPA figures, and sponsorship amounts. This bolsters the credibility of the discussion.

6. **Strong Conclusion:**  
   The conclusion effectively synthesizes the report and reiterates the adaptive strengths and ongoing issues for NSBE.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Formatting and Consistency:**  
   - Some sections blur the line between university-specific context and the national organization; a clearer distinction when switching between the two could help avoid confusion.
   - The introduction might benefit from explicitly listing all key frameworks/theories that will be used.

2. **Thesis/Objective Statement:**  
   - The executive summary is helpful, but the paper would benefit from a more explicit initial statement of purpose or research question before diving into details. State clearly: What is the main research goal or hypothesis of the paper?

3. **Critical Depth and Theoretical Integration:**  
   - While the frameworks such as Daft, Miles & Snow, and Quinn are referenced, sometimes the connection is quite brief. A slightly deeper discussion of how and *why* these frameworks illuminate NSBE’s structure would further strengthen the academic rigor.
   - Consider offering a small comparative analysis—how does NSBE’s structure and strategy compare to other similar student organizations?

4. **More Analytical Synthesis:**  
   - The paper often provides information in a “reporting” style. For a stronger critical analysis, more synthesis and evaluation could help. For example, when a challenge is presented (such as low graduate student engagement), offer potential solutions or deeper reasoning behind why the current solution may or may not work.

5. **Policy and Diversity Context:**  
   - When discussing affirmative action and its implications, acknowledge the complexity and sensitivity of the topic, perhaps noting wider societal trends or providing brief context for non-michigan readers.

6. **Visuals and Appendices:**  
   - The inclusion of the Quinn Model diagram is good, but referencing it more explicitly in the text could help the reader understand its relevance. Also, consider adding charts/tables for membership trends, budget breakdown, or event participation to complement the narrative.

7. **Proofreading and Clarity:**  
   - There are occasional small typos or awkward phrasings (e.g., “become and effective organization” should read “become an effective organization”). A thorough final proofread should catch these minor issues.

8. **References and Citations:**  
   - There is reference to concepts and theories (Daft, Miles & Snow, Quinn), but no formal citations or bibliography. Even if paraphrased, crediting sources strengthens academic integrity.

### **Summary Statement**

**Overall:**  
This is a strong, well-organized analytical report that combines theoretical frameworks with practical organizational analysis. It demonstrates critical thinking and provides real solutions and recommendations for NSBE’s challenges. Strengthening theoretical detail, employing a more analytical style, tightening up on formatting/proofreading, and adding citations would elevate this paper even further.

**Score (if grading out of 100):**  
**88-92** (very strong undergraduate work—mostly minor improvements could be made for clarity, depth, and polish).
