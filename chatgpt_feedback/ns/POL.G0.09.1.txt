Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on your essay, **"Living up to Constitutional Standards."**

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Structure and Flow**
- The paper is well-organized. You establish context about the U.S. government and the Constitution, explain the Eighth Amendment, and then walk through Estelle v. Gamble as a key example.
- There’s a logical progression from historical context to case study to societal impact.

### 2. **Strong Use of Evidence**
- The essay is informed by legal cases (e.g., Brown v. Board, Estelle v. Gamble, Furman v. Georgia) and statistics (e.g., about deaths from health insurance issues, costs of prison healthcare, hepatitis C rates).
- You reference primary and secondary sources in your bibliography, and include direct quotations from Supreme Court justices.

### 3. **Analysis of Broader Impact**
- You go beyond just describing the case, assessing its ripple effects (such as creation of oversight bodies and the improvement of healthcare standards).
- The reflection on the continuing shortcomings, like infectious disease and hepatitis C policies, adds balance.

### 4. **Engagement with Counterarguments**
- The summary of dissenting Justice Stevens’ concerns about Supreme Court intervention and case procedure shows nuanced understanding.

### 5. **Effective Conclusion**
- You tie the legal impact back to the theme of ordinary citizens effecting change, giving the essay a sense of purpose and closure.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Mechanical Errors & Word Choice**
- There are frequent typographical and grammatical errors:
    - “it’s citizenry” should be “its citizenry.”
    - “there application” should be “their application.”
    - “yeas” instead of “years.”
    - “Corretional” should be “Correctional.”
- Be careful with homophones and possessive pronouns. Proofread for these small but distracting mistakes.

### 2. **Objectivity and Tone**
- Occasionally, the language is a bit informal or subjective (e.g., “appalling turn of events,” “just shy of explicitly demanding,” “sleeping under a rock”). More formal academic prose would serve your arguments better.
- Phrasing like “the true power of the decision was yet to be felt” or “spark that would influence the resulting change” is somewhat vague and could be expressed in more concrete terms.

### 3. **Clarify and Expand Analysis**
- When referencing statistics (e.g., “over 18,000 Americans ... die prematurely ...”), clarify how this compares directly to the situation in prisons.
- The discussion of infectious disease control and hepatitis C at the end is informative, but could be integrated more tightly into the core argument. Tie these conditions more directly to the ongoing constitutional challenges.

### 4. **Formatting and Citations**
- The body of the essay lacks in-text citations, which makes it difficult to connect references from the bibliography to points in the essay.
- At least parenthetical source references or footnotes would help readers follow up on your claims.

### 5. **Depth on Legal Reasoning**
- You offer a good summary of Brennan’s “principle test” and Marshall’s opinion. However, a bit more detail on *how* the court decided that inadequate healthcare = cruel and unusual punishment would strengthen the argument for non-legal readers.
- Also, explain why the precedent in Estelle v. Gamble is not just significant, but how it practically changed prison policies (with some specifics).

### 6. **Sensitivity and Language**
- Avoid language that could be read as insensitive (e.g. “prisoners engage in homosexual activities”). Consider more precise and sensitive phrasing about sexual activity and transmission risks.

## Overall Impression

This is a **well-researched, logically structured, and strongly argued** undergraduate essay. It demonstrates insight into both the legal process and its real-world implications. With some **tightening of prose**, **rigorous proof-reading**, and **careful attribution of sources**, the work could reach a higher academic standard.

You do a particularly good job of showing **how legal change emerges from the efforts of ordinary individuals**, and how the judiciary can compel broad social change. This is exactly the type of insight strong undergraduate work should demonstrate.

### **Suggested Next Steps**
- Proofread for grammar and word usage.
- Add in-text citations.
- Refine some informal or vague wording.
- Consider integrating your concluding problems (like hepatitis C management) more explicitly as ongoing constitutional and ethical issues.
- Clarify the legal reasoning in Estelle v. Gamble for a lay audience.
