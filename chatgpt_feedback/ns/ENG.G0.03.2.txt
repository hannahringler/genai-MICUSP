Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your essay, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and some specific observations:

---

**Strengths**

1. **Thorough Literary Analysis:**  
   The essay thoughtfully engages with *As I Lay Dying*, diving deeply into Anse’s monologues and Faulkner’s methods. You show a strong grasp of literary interpretation and draw insightful connections between Anse’s lived experience and his (mis)understanding of God.

2. **Originality & Depth:**  
   Your discussion of the “problem of evil” and the disconnect between a theological conception of God and the reality lived by the Bundrens is nuanced and sophisticated. The exploration of Anse’s flawed theology—especially his misreadings of scripture—demonstrates strong critical thinking.

3. **Use of Textual Evidence:**  
   Frequent, well-integrated quotations from both Faulkner’s text and the Bible support your arguments and illustrate your analytical points convincingly.

4. **Structure & Progression:**  
   The essay is logically organized with a clear progression: you start with the problem of evil, move into specific textual analysis (the road, Cash, Addie), then broaden out to theological themes. It’s easy for the reader to follow your argument.

5. **Original Close Readings:**  
   The reading of Cash’s name and your interpretation of Addie’s “laying down” as symbolically tied to the road are both excellent examples of literary close reading.

**Areas for Improvement**

1. **Clarity and Focus**  
   At times, the argumentation around theological points gets a bit tangled (e.g., the discussion around “who” is responsible for the road: God or man). While ambiguity is often part of Faulkner’s method, occasionally your prose could be more concise and direct, clarifying whether the confusion is Faulkner’s, Anse’s, or the essay’s perspective.

2. **Thesis Statement**  
   The central claim is present but would benefit from a more explicit statement near the end of your introduction. Consider stating directly the thesis: that Faulkner critiques a simplistic, naive faith in God through Anse’s flawed theology and experiences.

3. **Engagement with Counterarguments**  
   The essay could benefit from briefly considering alternative interpretations—for example, are there moments in the novel where faith is portrayed more positively, or does another character offer a different view of God or suffering?

4. **Polish and Style**  
   There are a few small grammatical issues and some awkward phrasing (“he curses the rain because it appears to travel up the road toward his farm…” could be tightened). Also, the essay sometimes shifts between close reading and broader commentary in a way that makes the argument momentarily lose focus.

5. **Conclusion**  
   The essay ends a bit abruptly. A more robust concluding paragraph that synthesizes your findings and reflects on their implications for reading Faulkner—and perhaps the Christian tradition—would give the ending greater resonance.

**Specific Suggestions**

- **Quotations**: While you do an excellent job integrating quotes, make sure each quote is followed by sufficient explanation tying it back to your thesis and argument.
- **Scripture Misquotation**: When discussing Anse’s reversal of the scripture, you might briefly interpret why Faulkner has Anse make this mistake—is it merely error, or a subtle commentary on misunderstanding faith?
- **Narrative Voice**: Be mindful to distinguish between Faulkner’s narrative strategy, Anse's voice, and your own critical voice.
- **Formatting**: For formal submissions, double-check citation style, ensure consistent formatting for block quotes, and make sure your bibliography matches your in-text references.

**Overall Evaluation**

This paper makes a sophisticated and original argument, showing close engagement with both Faulkner’s text and Christian theology/myth. With a few improvements in clarity, focus, and structure—particularly framing your thesis more strongly and polishing the conclusion—this paper would be very strong for a senior undergraduate assignment.

**Score (if relevant):**  
A- (with room to push for A if revisions are made)
