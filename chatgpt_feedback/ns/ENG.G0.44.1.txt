Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on the essay **“Learning One’s Place in the World: An Analysis of the Evolution of Eve’s Understanding of Natural Patriarchy in John Milton’s Paradise Lost”**. I’ll cover higher-order concerns (argument, organization, evidence) as well as style and mechanics.

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Analytical Depth**
- The essay shows a strong engagement with Milton’s text and offers a nuanced reading of Eve’s evolution in *Paradise Lost*. You go beyond simple summary and interrogate the implications of gender, knowledge, and patriarchy thoughtfully.
- You highlight key passages and unpack them, contextualizing them within both the poem and broader religious and historical frameworks.

### **2. Use of Quotations**
- The essay consistently integrates well-chosen textual evidence. Most quotations are relevant and smoothly incorporated into paragraphs, showing close reading.

### **3. Engagement with Scholarship**
- There is awareness of the Protestant tradition and knowledge of Milton’s time, which enriches your argument.
- Reference to *Paradise Lost* and the King James Bible is apt and helps situate the argument.

### **4. Original Argument**
- The thesis—that Eve develops some self-awareness but ultimately returns to and chooses patriarchal subservience—is specific, debatable, and well-articulated.
- You do a good job tracing this evolution across different stages of the poem.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### **1. Organization & Structure**
- **Introduction:** While the introduction lays out the task and context, your main thesis gets somewhat buried. Consider condensing or sharpening the introduction to foreground your thesis more clearly.
- **Body Paragraphs:** Some paragraphs, especially in the middle, become quite long and could be split for clarity. For example, when transitioning from a discussion of Eve’s creation to her actions in Book IX, use more explicit signposting.
- **Topic Sentences:** Ensure every paragraph begins with a clear, controlling topic sentence that relates back to your thesis—this will help with conceptual clarity.

### **2. Clarity of Argument**
- **Ambiguity in Critique:** At some points, it’s unclear whether you are summarizing Milton’s position, your own interpretation, or critiquing Milton. Make your stance as an interpreter/critic distinct from summarizing Milton’s message—“Milton seems to argue…” vs. “This may suggest…”.
- **Balance:** While you note both moments of Eve’s agency and moments of subordination, sometimes your language drifts toward simply stating that Eve “willingly degrades herself” or “resigns herself to a submissive and inferior position.” Engage more with possible alternative readings—could this final passage also be read as subversive, or is it only capitulation? What do other critics say?

### **3. Development of Counterargument**
- Engage more directly with possible counterarguments—for example, critics who see Milton as ironically exposing the unfairness of patriarchy, or those who read Eve’s final choices as retaining some agency. This will strengthen your analysis and show awareness of interpretive debates.

### **4. Style & Mechanics**
- Some sentences are long and convoluted; shorter, punchier sentences might clarify your ideas. E.g., “Because the narrator does not absolutely understand the equality of man and woman, an initial doubt is instilled…”—here, “The narrator’s ambiguity about Adam and Eve’s equality introduces doubt for the reader.”
- There are some small typographical errors (e.g., inconsistent spelling of “thir” vs. “their”)—proofread for these.
- Integrate footnotes or parenthetical citations more consistently (e.g., lines from Milton should always be cited by book and line number).

### **5. Conclusion**
- The conclusion summarizes your argument succinctly, but it would benefit from a broader “so what?” statement—what do Milton’s sexual politics mean for readers today, or for the tradition of epic poetry?
