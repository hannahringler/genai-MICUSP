Absolutely, I’d be happy to provide feedback on this paper analyzing the use of elevated language in *Beowulf* and how it constructs the foil relationship between Beowulf and Grendel. Below are strengths, suggestions for improvement, and specific commentary:

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Thesis and Focus:**  
   The paper articulates a clear argument about the importance of elevated language in *Beowulf*, specifically in relation to character construction and the use of foils. The focus is maintained throughout.

2. **Textual Evidence:**  
   The paper draws thoroughly from the text, using well-chosen quotations to support claims about both Beowulf and Grendel.

3. **Analysis of Diction:**  
   There is perceptive analysis of word choice (“superlative forms,” “extravagant language”) and its effect on character construction.

4. **Comparative Structure:**  
   The foil relationship between Beowulf and Grendel is developed consistently, helping the reader follow the logic of the argument.

5. **Original Insights:**  
   The connections made between Beowulf and Christ, and between Grendel’s leadership in evil and Beowulf’s in good, show thoughtful engagement with the text.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Organization and Paragraphing:**  
   - Some paragraphs are quite long. Breaking them up—especially at points where you shift focus (e.g., from Beowulf’s description to Grendel’s)—would improve readability.
   - Clear topic sentences at the start of each paragraph could help guide the reader.

2. **Thesis Precision & Signposting:**  
   - The thesis in the introduction could be more sharply defined. For example, you might explicitly state, “This paper will show how the use of elevated diction intensifies the heroism of Beowulf and the monstrosity of Grendel, establishing them as perfect foils.”
   - At the end of body paragraphs, short summary sentences can reinforce how the discussed evidence supports your thesis.

3. **Scope and Balance:**  
   - While the paper thoroughly explores Beowulf’s depiction, some sections on Grendel are less developed, especially regarding how his villainous diction contrasts specifically with Beowulf’s heroism. Try to balance the focus.

4. **Clarity and Word Choice:**  
   - Occasionally, sentences are wordy (“the author utilizes the superlative form often in his descriptions of Beowulf”). Aim for directness: “The author frequently uses superlatives to describe Beowulf.”
   - Repetitive language (“elevated diction/language,” “extravagant language”)—consider varying vocabulary.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - The final paragraph could be more conclusive. Go beyond restating previous points by reflecting on why this dichotomy matters for the understanding of epic poetry or for readers’ moral engagement.

6. **Use of Literary Terms:**  
   - The paper sometimes vaguely refers to “elevated language” or “embellished diction.” Specify what makes the diction elevated: is it the use of kennings, compound adjectives, or heroic epithets? Bringing in a bit of terminology from epic poetry could strengthen analysis.

7. **Citation Format:**  
   - Ensure consistent citation, following MLA or another academic style. Parenthetical line references are good, but the first citation should clarify which translation/edition is being used.

**Line-By-Line Quick Notes:**

- The opening sentence effectively notes that *Beowulf* deviates from epic conventions, but it could provide examples for clarity (“Unlike epics such as the *Iliad*...”).
- “He has ‘it,’ and everyone can see it.” — This is informal. Consider rephrasing for academic tone.
- “It makes him an adversary from the start.” — Consider clarifying that this adversarial role is reinforced by diction.
- “Of course this is a reference to Beowulf’s conquest over Grendel, but...” — “Of course” can be omitted for a more formal style.
- Paragraph transitions are occasionally abrupt, especially when switching from direct textual analysis to broader commentary.

**Overall Evaluation:**

- The essay demonstrates a strong understanding of *Beowulf* and a genuinely analytical approach to the text.  
- With improved organization, a bit more balance, and tighter prose, the argument would be even more compelling.
- Additional focus on the literary mechanisms (e.g., kennings, types of epithets) would help showcase deeper engagement with literary analysis.

**Final Comment:**  
This is a thoughtful and insightful paper that engages well with its source material. Paying attention to structure, style, and depth of analysis will elevate it further. Keep building on your strong analytic instincts!
