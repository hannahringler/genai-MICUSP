Absolutely! Here is **detailed feedback** on your paper about Julie Taymor’s *Titus*:

---

### **Strengths**

**1. Clear Thesis and Focus:**  
Your paper presents a clear argument about Taymor’s blending of time periods and media in her adaptation of *Titus Andronicus*. You identify her cinematic techniques and frame your analysis around the interplay between theatre, cinema, and modernity.

**2. Use of Examples:**  
You effectively reference specific scenes (the dinner scene, the boy’s role, the Matrix-style camera work, the Croatian audience) to support your claims. This grounds your interpretation in concrete evidence from the film.

**3. Critical Insights:**  
You move beyond summary to make thoughtful points. For example, you note how the boy’s presence “allows for the audience to become aware of its viewing presence,” and you discuss the impact of showing real, modern audiences at the climax.

**4. Engagement with Secondary Sources:**  
You mention Donaldson’s article, bringing in academic context and demonstrating your engagement with scholarly work on the subject.

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Clarify the Central Argument:**  
While your thesis is strong, it could be slightly clearer. Try to explicitly state, near the beginning, that your essay will show how Taymor uses cinematic tools to force viewers to confront their own role as spectators of violence and spectacle.

**2. Organization and Transitions:**  
Though each paragraph contains interesting insights, the transitions between points can be smoother. For example, after describing the dinner scene, explicitly state *how* this reflects the blending of theatre, cinema, and reality, before moving on to the camera techniques.

**3. Deepen the Analysis:**  
In some places, you mention techniques (e.g., the presence of the modern boy, Matrix-style camera work), but don’t fully unpack their significance. For instance:
- *Why* does pausing the action with the camera swirling matter? How does this affect the viewer’s perception?
- The “game” metaphor could be further developed—what kind of game? What are the stakes? Is it meaningful that the violence is “play-acted”?

**4. Address Counterpoints:**  
You might anticipate objections: Do all viewers feel “mocked” or distanced, or might some instead feel more immersed? Is detachment *always* Taymor's goal, or does she sometimes draw us in emotionally? Briefly acknowledging these points can strengthen your analysis.

**5. Conclusion:**  
The essay’s conclusion is somewhat abrupt. Consider summarizing your main points and offering a final thought on what Taymor’s approach says about modern adaptations of Shakespeare—or about modern viewers’ relationship with violence in art.

**6. Stylistic and Mechanical Notes:**  
- Some sentences are long and could be broken up for clarity.
- Watch for repetition (e.g., the phrase “watch on—in horror and detachment” occurs more than once).
- Proofread for flow and variety in sentence structure.

### **Sample Revision of Your Thesis (for clarity):**
> “Through her blending of ancient and modern imagery, theatrical and cinematic techniques, and the self-conscious inclusion of both fictional and real-life spectators, Julie Taymor’s *Titus* compels viewers to confront their own complicity in the spectacle of violence, turning the act of watching itself into the film’s subject.”
