Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on **content, argumentation, structure, clarity, and recommendations for improvement**.

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Engagement with Philosophical Sources**
- You demonstrate a strong understanding of both A.J. Ayer’s and Charles Stevenson’s expressivist (emotivist) theories in ethics.
- The use of direct citations, as well as references to Herodotus and broader philosophical questions, shows thorough research and thoughtful engagement.

### 2. **Critical Analysis**
- Rather than just summarizing the views of Ayer and Stevenson, you critically examine their limits, especially in relation to moral education.
- You highlight a key problem: if moral discourse cannot proceed between people with fundamentally different attitudes, does this undermine the purpose or possibility of moral education?
- Comparing theories and raising the issue of *moral systems* versus *surface attitudes* gives your paper depth.

### 3. **Organization and Flow**
- The paper follows a logical structure: you start with Ayer, diagnose a problem via an example, introduce Stevenson as a refinement or antagonist, and pursue the issue further.
- Transitions are generally clear, and the reader is guided through your argument step by step.

### 4. **Philosophical Insight**
- The critique that "expressivism assumes such systems to be pre-existent and stubbornly stagnant" is a keen observation, reflecting genuine insight into both expressivism and the more dynamic process of moral reasoning.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Clarity and Style**
- At times, the prose is dense, with long sentences and philosophical jargon. This can obscure your main points.
    - **Example:** “If I press Stevenson once more why I should accept his basic ‘moral principle’ that ‘X is wrong,’ admittedly, Stevenson can eventually offer no further explanation in accordance with his expressivist theory.”
    - **Suggestion:** Break up sentences and explicitly signal your argument (e.g., “This shows that... Therefore... But this means...”).

### 2. **More Concrete Example(s)**
- The use of Herodotus is helpful, but you could clarify or add another contemporary example. For instance, bring in a modern moral controversy to illustrate how moral education goes beyond simple fact or attitude transmission.

### 3. **Directness of Critique**
- Sometimes the critique feels implied rather than explicit. For example, state more directly what is unsatisfying about “because I said so” when you discuss Stevenson.
- When you claim, "This form of education is unsatisfying," be sure to explain why, using philosophical language (e.g., “it cannot ground normativity...” or “it cannot account for moral progress...”).

### 4. **Engage With Possible Objections**
- You mention the expressivist possible response briefly ("This is not the meaning of disapproval to which I am referring..."), but consider fleshing out a potential rebuttal from Ayer/Stevenson and then countering it.
- For instance, might Stevenson say that rational reflection on attitudes is still *expressivist* at its root? How would you respond?

### 5. **Conclusion**
- The last few paragraphs set up an important argument but could be condensed and summarized more forcefully in a clear concluding paragraph. Recap your main point (“Expressivism fails to account for the full role of moral education because...”) and, perhaps, suggest briefly where a more robust theory might go (e.g., sensitivity to reasons, rational reflectivity, discourse ethics, etc.).

## **Minor Points**

- **Citations:** Generally good—ensure consistency (punctuation, page numbers, etc.).
- **Formatting:** As this appears to be a draft, double-check paragraph breaks and indentation for readability.

## **Sample Improved Opening (for clarity):**
> "A.J. Ayer famously declares that ethical concepts are 'pseudo-concepts' that add nothing to the factual content of statements. For Ayer, moral judgments merely express approval or disapproval, lacking genuine truth-value. However, this position raises a serious difficulty: if moral discourse is limited to the expression of personal sentiments, then moral education—typically seen as the rational development of one’s values—loses much of its substance. How, then, can societies teach or refine moral attitudes if, as Ayer claims, further discourse is impossible once all facts are established?"

## **Overall Evaluation**

This is an insightful and analytically strong essay. With improvements to clarity, more direct criticism, and a firm concluding section, it could be even more compelling. You demonstrate real engagement with philosophical issues and frame an important critique of expressivist meta-ethics.

**Grade (for reference):** A- (with minor improvements in style and argumentation, could be an A).
