Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, “Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV/AIDS in Low-Resource States.” I’ll break it down by strengths and areas for improvement, then offer general and specific suggestions.

---

**Strengths**

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  
   You have a well-structured literature review that shows you researched the topic in depth. Key sources are integrated throughout, and there’s a clear understanding of epidemiology, interventions, and the complexity of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) in low-resource settings.

2. **Critical Analysis:**  
   You don’t just summarize; you also critically engage with the material, discussing the gaps between policy and practice and highlighting structural violence and its role in perpetuating MTCT.

3. **Use of Evidence:**  
   You consistently reference reputable sources (e.g., JAMA, The Lancet, reports from WHO/UNICEF), ensuring your arguments are grounded in credible evidence.

4. **Awareness of Socioeconomic and Cultural Factors:**  
   The way you address structural violence, gender inequality, and economic issues demonstrates a holistic understanding of the problem. You recognize that solutions must be culturally tailored, not just medically effective.

5. **Clear Structure:**  
   The organization of your paper is logical, flowing from introduction to literature review, discussion, scale analysis (structural and individual), and conclusion.

**Areas for Improvement and Suggestions**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:**  
   Some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for clarity. Aim for clear, direct language—especially when describing complex social dynamics or health interventions.

   *Example:*  
   > “This great divide in who contracts HIV/AIDS and who is able to access treatment suggests deeply rooted structural violence and the inability of millions to receive aid.”  
   Could be:  
   > “The divide between those who contract HIV/AIDS and those who can access treatment reflects deeply rooted structural violence, leaving millions without aid.”

2. **Thesis/Argument Statement:**  
   Your introduction outlines the problem but could benefit from a more explicit thesis statement—what is your main argument or goal in this paper? State this clearly at the end of your introduction.

3. **Transitions:**  
   Some transitions between paragraphs and sections could be smoother. Make sure each section clearly connects to your overall argument or question.

4. **Balance Between Structure and Detail:**  
   The paper sometimes moves quickly from broad structural issues to specific intervention critiques without always signaling that transition to the reader. Use topic sentences to orient the reader at each stage.

5. **Paragraph Length:**  
   Some paragraphs are quite dense. Consider breaking them into shorter, focused sections to help with readability.

6. **Repetition:**  
   A few points (especially around structural violence and resource scarcity) repeat multiple times. Make your case strongly, then move forward without circling back unless adding new insight.

7. **Conclusion—Actionable Recommendations:**  
   While your conclusion highlights the need for a fundamental change in how women’s health is valued, it could be stronger with specific, actionable recommendations or a call to action.

8. **Formatting and Citations:**  
   Ensure consistent citation formatting (there are some typographical errors, e.g., “1175-1182 .”) and check for any missing references. Also, consider removing references to “In Class Video” unless you provide details or explain its significance.

**Overall Evaluation**

You have written a thoughtful, well-researched, and passionate paper that goes beyond technical solutions and interrogates the root causes of persistent MTCT of HIV in low-resource settings. Your discussion of structural violence is particularly strong and relevant. With some tightening for clarity, smoother transitions, and a more explicit thesis and recommendations, your paper would be even more impactful.

**Specific Section-Level Suggestions**

- **Introduction:**  
  Add a clear thesis statement. Consider tightening:  
  “This paper argues that to significantly reduce MTCT of HIV/AIDS in low-resource states, policy and programs must address not only medical interventions but also the underlying structural and cultural factors that shape women’s access to care.”

- **Literature Review:**  
  Briefly define “structural violence” for readers who may not be familiar.

- **Discussion/Structural Scale:**  
  When discussing economic disparities, connect more explicitly to how this impacts access on the ground—for example, link the cost of antiretrovirals directly to local health system constraints.

- **Individual Scale:**  
  Strong analysis of cultural and gender-specific barriers. Could benefit from examples or quotes from affected communities.

- **Conclusion:**  
  Suggest concrete next steps: e.g., “International aid organizations should partner with local women’s groups to co-develop culturally relevant interventions, subsidize antiretroviral therapy, and promote education campaigns that address gender inequality.”
