Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, both in terms of content and writing style:

---

### Strengths

**1. Ambitious Comparative Analysis**
- You undertake an impressive comparative approach, connecting Gabriel García Márquez’s *One Hundred Years of Solitude* with Virginia Woolf’s *Orlando* and E.T.A. Hoffmann’s “The Sandman” (and briefer nods to Lewis Carroll and “Sleeping Beauty”). This shows strong command of literary texts and theories.

**2. Thematic Clarity**
- Your central thesis—exploring how insomnia/sleep functions as metaphor for societal and individual disjunction across different works—is clear and original.
- The reversal you note (from society affecting the individual, and vice versa) demonstrates a deep engagement with literary motifs.

**3. Effective Use of Evidence**
- You blend textual evidence (direct quotations with proper citation) smoothly with analysis. Each example is relevant to your thesis about alienation, transformation, and fulfillment.

**4. Strong Structural Organization**
- Each paragraph develops logically from the last, and your transitions between texts and points are generally fluid and clear.

**5. Insightful Observations**
- You make sophisticated points about character transformation and the metaphysical implications of escape, especially in discussing Orlando’s metamorphosis and Nathanael’s tragic end.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Clarify and Expand Your Thesis (Introduction)**
- While your opening paragraph introduces the central metaphor, make your main argument even clearer: What are you arguing about the uses of sleep/insomnia as metaphor? A more assertive thesis statement will orient the reader better from the start.

**2. Tighten Topic Sentences**
- Some paragraphs could benefit from stronger topic sentences that explicitly link back to your thesis and preview the paragraph’s main idea.

**3. Develop Comparative Threads Further**
- You sometimes discuss each text in isolation before connecting them back together at the end of paragraphs. More often compare/contrast the characters and themes *within* paragraphs to strengthen your analysis.

**4. Balance Analytical Depth**
- Your reading of Orlando is very strong, but the discussion of Nathanael, while insightful, could go deeper. For example, explore why Nathanael fails where Orlando succeeds; is it personal failing, or a function of the kind of societies they inhabit?

**5. Minor Stylistic Issues**
- Some sentences are complex to the point of distraction—shorten and clarify for impact. For example:  
  > "This insomnia serves as a metaphor for the detrimental effects of a discordant individual upon society, instilling the loss of identity amongst an entire culture."  
  You could trim and clarify:  
  > "Insomnia becomes a metaphor for how a single discordant individual can erode collective identity."
- Occasional awkward or unclear phrases: “transformation of sex and eta” (did you mean “era” or something else?).

**6. Proofread for Mechanics**
- There are few typographical errors, but attention to minor details (comma use, omissions) will improve polish.

**7. Address Allusions in Conclusion**
- You introduce Alice (*Wonderland*) and Sleeping Beauty in passing at the end. Briefly expand how they fit your argument, or else omit them for stronger focus.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- **Revise your thesis** to be even more specific and argumentative.
- **Ensure each paragraph’s topic sentence** directly relates to your thesis and lays out the comparative element.
- **Deepen your comparative analysis** by explicitly drawing parallels or contrasts at the end of each body paragraph.
- **Edit sentence structure and wordiness** for readability and clarity.
- **Expand or cut passing references** in the conclusion for focus and coherence.

### Overall Assessment

This is an ambitious, thoughtful, and well-supported argument that shows strong close reading and an innovative comparative approach. With some tightening—especially upfront in the introduction and at the sentence level—this would be an excellent undergraduate literary analysis. You demonstrate clear understanding of both the texts and the broader literary implications of your theme.

**Grade range (if applicable):** A- to A
