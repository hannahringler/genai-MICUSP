Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback and critique of your paper, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and some suggestions for clarification and polish.

## Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**

1. **Analytical Depth & Originality:**  
   You provide a thoughtful and nuanced critique that draws on existing theories (Kim, Sullivan et al.) to challenge and reinterpret empirical findings from Sniderman and Piazza. Your engagement with conceptual distinctions (stereotyping vs. prejudice vs. tolerance) is sophisticated.

2. **Use of Theory:**  
   Integrating Kim’s framework of racial construction, power, and ordering adds significant analytical value, moving the discussion beyond surface-level readings of survey data.

3. **Structure & Organization:**  
   The paper follows a logical structure, leading the reader through a review of relevant chapters, theoretical summaries, and your own argument. Each section builds on the last, culminating in clear conclusions and implications.

4. **Critical Engagement:**  
   You critically question the assumptions behind measurement in social science, which is an advanced and important move for work at this level.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Clarity of Argument**

- **Thesis Statement:**  
  In the introductory paragraph, your thesis could be stated more succinctly. While your introduction does outline where you are headed, the main argument appears a little diffuse. Consider distilling your main claim (e.g., "Black stereotyping of Jews, as measured in Sniderman and Piazza, is not straightforward evidence of anti-Semitism, but may instead indicate political tolerance; this challenges standard measurement of prejudice.") into a single, bold sentence early on.

### 2. **Definition & Conceptual Precision**

- **Stereotyping vs Prejudice vs Tolerance:**  
  Although you discuss the differences between these concepts throughout, consider defining each term as you use it, possibly in a short paragraph in your introduction or early in the paper. This will ensure the reader clearly tracks your distinctions.

- **"Tolerance" as Used by Sullivan:**  
  Since your argument hinges on Sullivan et al.'s concept of "tolerance," give a little more emphasis to WHY their measurement matters in this context—perhaps by summarizing limitations of previous prejudice measurements (not just Sniderman and Piazza’s).

### 3. **Use of Evidence**

- **Engagement with Sniderman & Piazza:**  
  While you reference their data and experiments, more direct engagement with specifics from the text would clarify your points (for instance, quoting or closely summarizing findings that you challenge). This also strengthens your claims of reinterpretation.

- **Addressing Counterarguments:**  
  In your response to the possible objection ("isn't it important how one group feels about another?"), you deal briefly with methodology. Flesh this out with more specifics—why are Likert scale questions insufficient, and what would you want instead? Give an example if possible.

### 4. **Writing Style & Organization**

- **Transitions:**  
  Some transitions between sections could be smoother. For example, when you move from summarizing Sniderman & Piazza to discussing Sullivan et al., signpost the reader with a clear statement about how the first study’s limitations are addressed by the second framework.

- **Repetition:**  
  There is a bit of repetition in explaining the theoretical points (e.g., definitions of prejudice), which could be tightened. Once you've clearly defined terms, refer back to those definitions succinctly rather than reiterating them.

- **Conclusion:**  
  Your conclusion is solid but could benefit from a stronger and more concise summary of implications (“Therefore, policy analysts/scholars should…”) and perhaps a brief statement of what further research or data would be helpful to advance this debate.

---

## Minor Points

- **Grammar & Mechanics:**  
  Generally clean, but there are a few typographical errors and awkward phrasings. For instance:  
  - “Theoretical schema Kim offers…” → “The theoretical schema that Kim offers…”  
  - Watch for misplaced commas and sentence run-ons.

- **In-Text Citations:**  
  Ensure all in-text citations match formal style guidelines (APA, Chicago, etc.) as required by your instructor.

- **Works Cited:**  
  Nicely formatted and complete.

## Suggested Revision Sample

> "This paper argues that black stereotyping of Jews, as detailed by Sniderman and Piazza (2002), should not be equated with anti-Semitism. Drawing on Kim’s (2000) concept of racial ordering and Sullivan et al.'s (1979) political tolerance measurement, I contend that such stereotyping—if not translated into discriminatory behavior—may in fact signal political tolerance rather than animus. This essay critically evaluates how social science conceptualizes and measures racial prejudice, highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches."

## Overall Rating: **A-** (with potential for solid A with some tightening)

**You do excellent theoretical work and engage deeply with the literature. With a bit more polish and attention to definition and argumentation clarity, this could be a model grad-level essay.**
