Absolutely! Here is detailed and constructive feedback on your essay titled “We Will Both Praise it Now: A discussion on History, Memory, and the voices who sing of both.”

## Strengths

**1. Sophisticated Engagement with Theory**
- You deftly engage with key theorists—Carolyn Kay Steedman, Walter Benjamin, Edward Said, and others—which gives your argument a strong, scholarly foundation. This grounds your discussion of history and memory in a critical tradition.

**2. Comparative Analysis**
- Your comparison of Walcott’s *Omeros* and Coetzee’s *Waiting for the Barbarians* is well chosen and nuanced. You carefully articulate differences in form (choral vs. solitary voice) and geography (concrete St. Lucia vs. fictional frontier), showing how each author dramatizes memory and history in distinct yet parallel ways.

**3. Clear Thesis and Consistent Focus**
- Your thesis—about the tension and interplay between history (as an "official" account) and memory (as personal or marginalized story)—is clear and consistently referenced. Each author and example you discuss circles back to this central concern.

**4. Use of Secondary Sources**
- Well-placed references (Williams, Gallagher, Klein, King, Said) demonstrate robust research and effectively bolster your analysis.

**5. Insightful Close Reading**
- You perform careful close readings of key passages, especially in your analysis of Plunkett and the Magistrate, which substantiates your claims about their efforts to inscribe memory against official histories.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Clarity and Conciseness**
- Some sentences are unnecessarily long or complex, which can obscure your meaning. For example:
    - *"Walcott abstracts the Caribbean island into mythical proportions by creating a labyrinth of memories, histories, and identities."*  
    Consider: *"Walcott transforms the Caribbean island into a mythic landscape, interweaving memories, histories, and identities."*
- Aim to simplify sentence structure for clarity and readability.

**2. Paragraph Transitions**
- While your sections are well-organized, transitions between paragraphs and sections could be smoother. Occasionally, the essay feels segmented. Try using transitional phrases to guide the reader and signal shifts in focus.

**3. Depth of Textual Analysis**
- While you do a strong job summarizing each author's technique, occasionally the analysis could delve deeper. For example, you reference the “chorus” of voices in *Omeros* often—can you illustrate this further with a specific passage or by exploring how this multiplicity complicates the notion of 'the historical record'?
- Similarly, discuss more specifically how Coetzee’s “allegory” works—are there examples of ambiguity or indeterminacy in the Magistrate’s memory?

**4. Integration of Theory and Primary Texts**
- Sometimes theoretical discussion takes over, at the expense of sustained attention to the literature itself. For a reader less familiar with the theory, these moments are dense. After invoking a theorist, always connect back clearly to how this shapes your reading of the novels.

**5. “Forgetting” as Theme**
- Your insights on forgetting are promising but underdeveloped. The paragraph on forgetting in *Omeros*, for example, could go further—how does forgetting relate to shame, survival, or the production of new identities? Are there moments of creative or productive forgetting?

**6. Proofreading and Formatting**
- There are more than a few minor typos and occasional awkward phrases, e.g.:
    - “the dominate history” (should be “the dominant history”)
    - “to make a history or them, do not serve…” (awkward/typo: "for them")
- Ensure all direct quotes are clearly cited, and double-check for missing/incorrect punctuation.
- Works Cited formatting could be standardized (spacing, indentation, etc.).

**7. Conclusion**
- The concluding statements are somewhat abrupt. Consider using your conclusion not just to summarize, but to reflect on the broader implications of your argument. For example: What does your analysis suggest about contemporary debates on public memory, national identity, or the role of literature in shaping history? Can literature change who “gets” to write history?

## Summary

**Overall, this is a strong, thoughtful essay, demonstrating deep reading, broad knowledge of theory, and mature analysis.** With a bit more polish, sharper focus on passage-level literary analysis, and attention to flow and concision, this paper would reach a higher level of sophistication.

**Suggestions for revision:**
- Cut or split longer sentences to improve readability.
- Use more signposting between sections.
- Add one or two deeper analyses of chosen quotations from each book.
- Expand slightly on the theme of forgetting.
- Proofread for typos and formatting consistency.
- Rework the conclusion to offer broader takeaways or implications.
