Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback review of the paper, "Increasing Women's Participation in Math and Science Careers: Causes and an Intervention."

---

### Overall Assessment

This paper provides a comprehensive and well-organized examination of the causes behind the under-representation of women in math and science careers, evaluates existing interventions, and proposes a thoughtful, research-based new intervention. The use of relevant literature supports the arguments, and the writing is clear and mostly well-structured.

---

### Strengths

**1. Clear Structure:**  
The paper follows a logical structure—introduction, causes, interventions (existing and proposed), measuring effectiveness, limitations, and conclusion. This makes it easy to follow.

**2. Good Use of Literature:**  
The paper draws on many relevant studies, using them to support major points. Citations are appropriate and provide a solid foundation for the arguments.

**3. Relevant and Realistic Intervention Proposal:**  
The intervention—teacher training on stereotype threat, self-efficacy, and supportive classroom environment—is realistic, especially as it draws on previously successful models (like “wise” schooling) and thoughtful application to younger students.

**4. Critical Evaluation and Limitations:**  
You demonstrate critical thinking by considering potential limitations of your intervention and of generalizing earlier research.

**5. Academic Tone and Clarity:**  
The writing style is appropriate for an upper-level undergraduate audience and is largely clear and concise.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Depth of Critical Evaluation:**  
While you briefly mention the limitations of past interventions (e.g., generalizability from African American college students to young girls), you could be more critical in evaluating:
  - The limitations of the research methods in the cited studies (e.g., sample sizes, lack of longitudinal data).
  - Possible unintended effects or challenges—e.g., teacher resistance, institutional barriers, or the need for parental/community involvement.

**2. Originality and Specificity of Proposed Intervention:**  
While your proposed intervention is sensible, it remains a bit broad. Consider specifying:
  - Concrete examples of curriculum/teaching method changes.
  - How to tailor interventions for different ages or communities.
  - What kinds of teacher training are most effective (e.g., workshops, peer-mentoring, ongoing support).

**3. Practicality and Feasibility:**  
The proposed longitudinal study is ambitious, but very resource-intensive (time, money, coordination). Mentioning possible funding sources or pilot studies, or proposing incremental changes, could make the plan more feasible.

**4. Addressing Intersectionality:**  
The paper focuses on gender but does not discuss how intersections with race, class, or disability might further compound under-representation in math and science. Integrating intersectional perspectives would strengthen the analysis.

**5. Writing and Style Minor Points:**
- There are minor grammatical/word choice errors (e.g., “elected high school science classes” should probably be “elective high school science classes”).
- Occasionally, the transition between paragraphs could be smoother.

**6. Data Currency:**  
Some citations and statistics are from 2003 and 2007. If updated data is available, referencing more recent trends would strengthen your case.

### Suggestions for Further Development

- Expand on how such classroom changes would be implemented and monitored in diverse educational contexts.
- Consider including qualitative data or testimonials from women in math/science to enrich your argument.
- Discuss broader cultural, social, and policy-level changes that could complement classroom-based interventions.
- Reflect briefly on how your intervention could be adapted if the longitudinal study shows only modest effects.

---

### Summary

**Grade (if applicable):** A-  

You have written a strong, well-researched paper with a solid intervention proposal and an excellent grasp of the literature. With a bit more specificity in the intervention, deeper critical evaluation, and attention to intersectionality and feasibility, the paper would be even stronger.

Great work!
