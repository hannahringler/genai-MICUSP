Absolutely! Here is a structured feedback on your paper, “Components of Effective Adolescent Sexual Education: Parents, Schools and Safe-Sex Knowledge,” based on common academic writing criteria:

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Clear Organization & Structure**
   - The paper is well-organized, with clear sections: Introduction, Family-Based Education, School and Community-Based Education, Comprehensive Sexual Education, Limitations and Future Directions, and References.
   - Each section smoothly transitions into the next, creating a logical flow of information.

2. **Strong Use of Evidence**
   - You reference multiple peer-reviewed studies and data from reputable sources (CDC), reinforcing your claims.
   - The paper effectively integrates empirical evidence to support main points, enhancing credibility.

3. **Critical Evaluation**
   - You don’t just summarize studies; you examine their strengths and weaknesses, such as sample limitations, self-report bias, and generalizability.
   - Suggestions for future research demonstrate critical thinking about the current state and limitations of the literature.

4. **Policy Implications**
   - You extend your findings to practical recommendations, such as funding comprehensive over abstinence-only sex education. This is valuable for applied social science writing.

5. **Scholarly Tone**
   - The language is formal and academic, suitable for a university-level paper.
   - Proper in-text citations and a well-formatted reference list at the end add to the professionalism.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Thesis Clarity**
   - The thesis could be stated more explicitly at the end of the introduction. While your argument is clear overall, a concise thesis statement outlining your main claim would orient readers from the outset.

2. **Depth of Analysis**
   - Many of the limitations and strengths you identify are quite general (e.g., small sample, self-report). Whenever possible, consider digging deeper—*why* might a small sample lead to limited generalizability, and were there attempts to mitigate bias?
   - You mention the lack of studies on minority sexual orientations; incorporating even a small amount of existing literature or noting the impact of that absence in current policy would strengthen your critique.

3. **Integration of Source Material**
   - Although the summary of each study is solid, try to synthesize findings across studies rather than treating each in isolation. For example, compare how parental communication impacts sexual behavior across different cultural contexts, or how different school-based interventions align or diverge in outcomes.

4. **Balanced Discussion of Counterarguments**
   - While the paper is evidence-based, it presents comprehensive sex education as categorically superior, which is strongly supported by your sources. For balance, briefly consider any arguments or evidence used by advocates of abstinence-only education to show you’ve fully engaged with the debate—even if you then refute them.

5. **Conclusion**
   - Your final paragraphs are effective, but the paper would benefit from a stronger, more explicit conclusion that succinctly restates key findings, underscores their significance, and highlights the most urgent recommendations for policy and practice.

6. **Minor Stylistic Points**
   - Try to avoid repetitious phrasing (e.g., “This study’s limitation was…” at the start of multiple sentences).
   - Double-check for minor grammatical or typographical errors (e.g., missing words, agreement between subject/verb).

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a strong and sophisticated review paper, particularly in its structure, engagement with relevant literature, and critical evaluation of sources. With refinement of your thesis and conclusion, deeper synthesis across studies, and some stylistic tweaks, it could be even more compelling.

**Grade Suggestion (if relevant):** A- to A (with further minor refinements, definitely in the A range!)

**Key Recommendation:** Make your thesis and conclusion more explicit, and synthesize across sources for depth and cohesion.
