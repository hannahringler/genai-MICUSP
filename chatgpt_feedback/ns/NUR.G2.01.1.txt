- The integration of Biblical principles and personal values adds sincerity and depth to your response.

### 3. **Application to Practice**

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Critical Analysis**
- While your descriptions and personal applications are strong, some areas would benefit from more critical analysis. For example:
    - Recognize and briefly discuss potential challenges or drawbacks of each strategy or idea.
    - For example, “giving 110%” is admirable, but can also risk burnout—acknowledging this nuance shows advanced critical thinking.

### 2. **Integration of Evidence**
- While you reference McGraw, Peters, and scripture, you could enhance academic rigor by briefly integrating evidence or viewpoints from additional scholarly sources—especially for ideas like flexibility, communication, or leadership in APN practice.

### 3. **Balance of Personal and Professional**
- Your personal experiences are well-illustrated. For a graduate-level paper, further highlighting broader implications for the nursing profession or healthcare teams (beyond yourself) could strengthen your work.

### 4. **Clarity and Conciseness**
- Some paragraphs are quite lengthy and could be broken up for easier reading. Focus on concise, direct sentences to increase impact.
- Avoid repetition—occasionally you restate the same idea in slightly different words.

### 5. **APA/Scholarly Formatting**
- Double check your reference section and ensure in-text citations match APA format or the required style for your course.
- Page numbers and running headers are good; just ensure consistency in formatting.

### 6. **Specificity in Action Steps**
- When you mention wanting to apply these ideas in practice, briefly suggest specific, actionable steps, especially in the Peters section (e.g., how exactly will you “nurture other leaders” or implement “WOW projects”?).

### 7. **Connecting Strategies Together**
- You point out similarities between strategies, which is good. Expanding on the interrelationship between them—how, for example, honesty, flexibility, and active listening work together—would further demonstrate higher-order thinking.

## **Summary Statement**
Overall, this is a thoughtful, thorough, and well-organized paper that effectively integrates personal reflection with concepts from McGraw and Peters. With deeper critical analysis, tighter integration of scholarly literature, and even more concise writing, this would be a strong graduate-level submission. Your passion for nursing and patient-centered care is clear and commendable!
