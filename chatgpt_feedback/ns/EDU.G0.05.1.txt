Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your reflective teaching assignment, focusing on both strengths and areas for potential improvement:

---

## Overall Strengths

### 1. **Organized Structure**
- **Clear Sections:** The paper follows a logical structure: analysis of the original lesson, revised lesson plan, rationale, and reflections. This organization makes it easy to follow your thinking and planning process.
- **Explicit Criteria:** Using explicit criteria (eliciting students’ ideas, sense making, assessment) demonstrates a thoughtful, analytic approach to lesson planning.

### 2. **Thorough Analysis and Reflection**
- **Critical Reflection:** You critically analyze the original lesson plan, directly referencing what it did and did not include for each criterion. For example, you point out the lack of opportunity for student predictions and explanations in the original plan.
- **Rationale for Revisions:** You explain not just what you changed, but why—this is crucial for demonstrating reflective practice.
- **Awareness of Student Thinking:** You show awareness of students’ prior knowledge and possible misconceptions, and you actively aim to surface and address these.

### 3. **Focus on Inquiry and Student Engagement**
- **Student-Centered Revisions:** Your changes, such as asking students to make models, share ideas, and revise based on evidence, are clearly more inquiry-oriented and authentically engage students in science practices.
- **Use of Multiple Modalities:** Including drawing, writing, discussing, and video provides different entry points for learning.

### 4. **Assessment for Learning**
- **Formative Assessment:** The use of worksheets for models, explanations, and revisions, as well as exit slips to capture lingering questions, demonstrates a solid approach to formative assessment—much more reflective of actual learning than a simple writing rubric.

### 5. **Alignment with Standards**
- You connect the lesson goals to state and national standards, ensuring the lesson’s rigor and relevance.

## Areas for Improvement / Suggestions

### 1. **Depth of Student Voice**
- **Examples:** Consider including more direct examples or anticipated student responses. What are some specific things students might say or draw in their models? This level of anticipation can help you plan for productive classroom discourse and address misconceptions more intentionally.

### 2. **Assessment Detail**
- While you mention formative assessment, you could briefly describe how you would use the data from the worksheets and exit slips to inform next steps. For example, will you reteach a concept, or adjust the next lesson if you notice persistent misunderstandings?
- **Rubrics:** You might sketch a brief rubric for the diagrams/models to clarify expectations for students and to ensure consistency in assessing understanding.

### 3. **Differentiation**
- Consider how the lesson could be differentiated for students with varying levels of prior knowledge or learning needs (e.g., ELLs, students with IEPs).
- What supports or extensions might you offer?

### 4. **Explicit Connection to Prior Knowledge**
- You reference connecting the lesson to prior activities but could describe more precisely how you will elicit that knowledge (for example, through specific questions, a KWL chart, or a demonstration).

### 5. **Opportunities for Student Discussion**
- While you mention partner and whole group discussion, it could help to specify strategies for ensuring all students get to share (e.g., think-pair-share, structured academic talk routines).

### 6. **Use of Science and Engineering Practices**
- The lesson does a great job with modeling and argumentation. You might explicitly call out other practices (e.g., planning investigations, interpreting data) even if they are not the main focus of this lesson.

### 7. **Technology Use**
- You use a video very intentionally. A quick reflection on tech access/logistics or possible alternatives if technology fails would round out the practical planning.

## Praise for Strong Points

- **Reflective Practice:** Your honest reflection ("I even learned something!") and your willingness to adapt existing resources show a strong, growth-oriented mindset.
- **Inquiry Orientation:** The move from teacher-centered delivery to student-centered investigation is a big strength. Your explanation of why your lesson became more inquiry-focused is clear and persuasive.
- **Evaluation of Curriculum Materials:** Your assessment of the strengths and limitations of the borrowed lesson plans shows thoughtful professional judgment.

## Summary Statement

This paper is a well-developed reflection and revision of a science lesson, highlighting growth in inquiry-based teaching. With a few added details on assessment use, student discussion, and differentiation, it would be exemplary. Your focus on eliciting and building on student ideas, and on formative assessment, is especially praiseworthy—keep developing those strategies in all content areas!
