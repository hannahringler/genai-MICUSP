Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, organized by **strengths** and **areas for improvement**, followed by some **specific suggestions**.

---

## **Strengths**

1. **Clear Structure and Organization**
   - The paper has a logical flow: it introduces the topic, examines three case studies (Holt, Suny, Reis), and draws their relevance to the “new social history.” You situate each historian’s intervention nicely within broader historiographical trends.
   - Each section is clearly signposted with reference to main arguments and supporting evidence.

2. **Engagement with Scholarship**
   - You demonstrate excellent engagement with foundational texts and authors, not just summarizing their content but critically engaging with their theoretical underpinnings (e.g., your handling of Holt’s critique of the Freudian paradigm, and your awareness of historiographical debate about “culture” vs. “social”).
   - Your range is impressive: Thompson, Suny, Holt, Reis, secondary theoretical frameworks, and historiographical context.

3. **Strong Use of Evidence**
   - You use well-chosen examples (e.g., German complicity in Nazism; Brazilian funeral rites) to illustrate abstract concepts. 
   - Quotations are incorporated smoothly and analytically.

4. **Analytical Depth**
   - Your analysis does not merely summarize the historians’ points but interrogates their significance ("the practical value of his [Holt’s] work only goes so far,” “Reis is careful to note, economic and religious interests were intertwined…").
   - You discuss the implications of historicizing “eternal” categories, avoiding teleology, and challenging naturalization.

## **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Thesis Clarity**
   - While your introduction states the main theme, your own thesis—the particular insight or intervention your paper is making—could be clearer. What specifically are *you* arguing about “new social history” and historicization? Try to make this explicit early on.

2. **Conclusion Needs Expansion**
   - The paper ends somewhat abruptly without a formal conclusion. You should briefly synthesize your analyses and reflect on why “historicizing” race, politics, and religion matters for historians and for current debates—drawing connections between the three cases.

3. **Occasional Wordiness/Complex Sentences**
   - Some sentences are quite long or densely packed with clauses, which can make them hard to follow. For example:  
     > “Thus, these historians perform an admirable task: one of reconciling the social history of the 1960s and 70s with the dominant cultural history of the 80s and 90s, placing the historical discipline on the threshold of a new era.”
   - Aim for a balance between sophistication and clarity.

4. **Authorial Voice and Critical Distance**
   - Sometimes you write in an approving tone (“admirable task,” “does a fine job”) rather than maintaining critical academic distance. Even when you agree, strive for neutral phrasing.
   - You sometimes alternate between discussing what historians do and what “we” should do; clarify your position—is this your analysis, or are you channeling their aims?

5. **Transitions and Synthesis**
   - You cover each historian thoroughly, but transitions between the case studies could be smoother. After each section, briefly connect back to your central theme or note the differences and similarities between the approaches.

## **Specific Suggestions**

- **Thesis Statement**:  
  In your introduction, state explicitly: what is the value, challenge, or risk of historicizing identity categories? (e.g., “By historicizing categories like race, politics, and religion, new social historians challenge naturalized assumptions, but also encounter new methodological dilemmas regarding agency and structure…”).

- **Concluding Paragraph**:  
  Return to your opening questions. Why does historicizing matter for contemporary debates—about race, culture, politics? What should future historians take from these interventions?

- **Sentence Level**:  
   - Break up long sentences into two when the ideas shift.
   - Use more topic sentences at the beginning of paragraphs to guide readers.

- **Citations**:  
   - Make sure all citations are consistently formatted. Sometimes your Chicago style is interrupted (e.g., missing italics, or inconsistent abbreviation of “Ibid.”).

## **Summary**

This paper reflects very strong engagement with historiography and a sophisticated understanding of “new social history.” You are ready to dive further into original analysis and refine your academic voice. Focus on clarifying your own thesis, tightening prose, and bringing the pieces together in a thoughtful conclusion. Overall, this is excellent graduate-level work—well done!
