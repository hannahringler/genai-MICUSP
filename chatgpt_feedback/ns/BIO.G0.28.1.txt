Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, **“Relative Abundance of Myotis septentrionalis and Myotis lucifugus in Three Habitats in Northern Michigan”**. This feedback covers the main scientific components as well as presentation and clarity.

## Content & Structure

### **Strengths**

1. **Clear Research Questions & Hypotheses**
   - The introduction does an excellent job of setting up the comparison between *M. lucifugus* and *M. septentrionalis*, including relevant ecological and morphological background.
   - The rationale for expecting habitat and temporal segregation is well explained.

2. **Methodology**
   - Site selection and use of the Anabat detector are well documented.
   - There is a good explanation of how calls were analyzed and identified, including use of discriminant function analysis for ambiguous calls.
   - The control for extraneous variables (temperature, rainfall) is clear.

3. **Results**
   - The data is clearly presented, with quantified call numbers, significance values (p-values, U-values, etc.), and reference to clear figures.
   - The inclusion of figures/graphs helps to visualize spatial and temporal patterns.

4. **Discussion**
   - You interpret the results sensibly, relating findings back to the hypothesis.
   - Limitations are acknowledged, particularly regarding reliance on call counts and potential issues with the detection method.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Abstract**
   - Condense slightly to focus only on the most important findings and methods. The abstract is a bit long and contains more detail than necessary. Try to keep it to 2–3 sentences on background, 2–3 on methods, and the rest on the main results and their implications.

2. **Introduction**
   - While informative, the introduction could benefit from a synthesis/summary paragraph before stating the hypotheses, highlighting why understanding this habitat/temporal partitioning matters.
   - Briefly introduce the broader ecological or conservation value of studying habitat preferences in bats.

3. **Methods**
   - Clarify whether sites were sampled in a randomized order and if all habitats were sampled equally (the text says two sites per night—does this rotate so all receive equal effort?).
   - Consider mentioning any limitations regarding call identification more explicitly (could species with overlapping call frequencies be confused?).

4. **Results**
   - The figures are good, but make sure each one is explicitly referenced and discussed in the body of the results, not just placed together at the end.
   - Always state the sample sizes (n) in the written results for clarity, especially for statistics.

5. **Discussion**
   - There is only a brief mention of alternative explanations for patterns observed (e.g., observer placement, detector range, or prey distribution). A little more discussion on *why* the bats prefer certain habitats (beyond just call adaptation) would add depth.
   - When discussing limitations (e.g., one bat making multiple passes), suggest how future studies might address this (e.g., simultaneous mist netting, radio telemetry).

6. **Literature/Citations**
   - The literature cited is solid and up-to-date for the time. Ensure all works cited are referenced in the main text.
   - If possible, integrate more synthesis from the most relevant recent studies (if any exist).

7. **Presentation**
   - Proofread for minor typos, grammatical errors, and consistency (e.g., species names are italicized, and ensure all scientific notations—*P*, *n*, etc.—are consistently formatted).
   - Figures and tables should have fully descriptive legends so they are understandable without reference to the main text.

## **Summary Feedback**

**Overall, this is a well-designed and clearly written undergraduate research paper, with strong methods, justified hypotheses, and careful interpretation. You demonstrate a good understanding of bat ecology and acoustic monitoring. A little tightening up of the structure, minor improvements to clarity, and a bit more depth in the discussion would take it to the next level. Well done!**

If you want, I can also provide sample rewrite/edits for any section, suggestions for stronger conclusions, or advice on submitting to undergraduate journals. Just let me know!
