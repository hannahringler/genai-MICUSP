Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback analysis on the paper, "Economics of the Illicit-Drug Market," based on content, structure, argumentation, use of evidence, style, and areas for improvement.

---

### **Strengths**

**1. Comprehensive Coverage:**  
The essay covers a wide range of economic, social, and philosophical dimensions of the illicit drug market. It not only discusses supply and demand but also considers negative externalities, opportunity costs, and broader societal impacts.

**2. Use of Support and Evidence:**  
The author supports claims with a variety of sources—academic papers, policy reports, journalistic articles, and seminal works in economics and philosophy. Real-world examples, such as sentencing laws, costs of incarceration, and harm reduction models, add credibility.

**3. Structure and Organization:**  
The paper follows a logical progression: introducing the issue, discussing the inefficiencies of prohibition, detailing costs and externalities, reviewing alternative policies, and, finally, considering philosophical angles before concluding. The use of headings or topic sentences helps the reader follow the argument.

**4. Engagement with Policy Alternatives:**  
It’s a positive that the author doesn’t propose simplistic solutions. By discussing partial reforms—like decriminalization, harm reduction, and the Dutch model—the paper offers a nuanced view rather than a binary approach.

**5. Balanced Philosophical Treatment:**  
The philosophical discussion shows an understanding of moral arguments both for and against prohibition. The author references Husak, Nozick, and Rawls, broadening the scope from economics to ethics and law.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### **A. Clarity and Conciseness**
- Some sentences are overly long and could be trimmed for clarity. For example:  
  > “However, as will be shown, the costs associated with these problems are tremendous, and we must now call into question whether or not current forms of prohibition and resource allocation are an effective and efficient means of attacking these problems.”  
  Could be revised to:  
  > “However, the tremendous costs associated with these problems call into question whether current forms of prohibition and resource allocation are efficient or effective.”

**Action:** Review for concise language. Shorter sentences often aid readability.

#### **B. Thesis and Topic Sentences**
- The thesis is implied but not always explicit. Early in the essay, the reader would benefit from a clear, direct statement of the paper's main argument.
- Some paragraphs open with evidence rather than topic sentences. This can make structural transitions less clear.

**Action:**  
- Strengthen the thesis up front.  
- Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence outlining what it will discuss.

#### **C. Paragraph Development**
- Several paragraphs are very long and should be split for easier reading and better focus. Dense paragraphs can obscure major points.
- In some places, ideas bleed into one another (for example, the discussion of costs and externalities sometimes overlaps).

**Action:** Divide long paragraphs and group related points more tightly.

#### **D. Addressing Counterarguments More Directly**
- The paper describes arguments against legalization mainly in summary form. Directly engaging counterarguments and responding to them would make the argument more robust.
- For example, opponents’ concerns about increased usage post-legalization could be addressed with empirical evidence from places that have decriminalized certain drugs.

**Action:** Explicitly state, then rebut, the most common counterarguments.

#### **E. Style and Tone**
- The essay sometimes shifts between formal academic voice and a more conversational tone. Phrases like “Shockingly” or direct appeals like “perhaps more emotionally appealing, however…” can be toned down for a more consistent style.
- There are some small grammatical or typographical issues (incomplete/awkward phrases, e.g., “the most powerful incentive for participation lies in the opportunity to move up the ladder where the more lucrative wages are made”).

**Action:** Proofread for tone and grammar to ensure formality and consistency.

#### **F. More Recent Sources**
- Many sources cited are more than 15 years old. While some are classics, incorporating newer research, data, or policy outcomes (such as those from recent marijuana legalization efforts in US states and other countries) would strengthen the paper’s relevance.

**Action:** Update with more contemporary sources if possible.

#### **G. Conclusion**
- The conclusion could be strengthened by restating the central argument and summarizing the strongest evidence more directly.
- The inclusion of philosophical considerations is good, but it would benefit from a stronger final statement linking economics and moral reasoning.

### **Final Assessment**

**Overall, this is a strong undergraduate essay that demonstrates critical thinking, research, and the ability to synthesize complex arguments.**  
To improve, focus on clarity, structure, conciseness, and the addition of more recent examples. More robust engagement with counterarguments and a tighter conclusion would push this paper closer to an “A” level.

**If you’d like, I can suggest a brief revision of the introduction or conclusion to illustrate how to implement some of these changes!**
