Certainly! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, “In God we trust?” The Battle between Evolution and Intelligent Design:

---

**Strengths**

1. **Thorough Historical Context:**  
   Your paper does an excellent job outlining key legal cases (Scopes, Lemon v. Kurtzman, Abington v. Schempp, Edwards v. Aguillard, Dover, Cobb County) that shaped the debate over religion and science in U.S. education. This gives readers a solid understanding of the topic's complexity and evolution over time.

2. **Balanced Consideration of Both Sides:**  
   You present the arguments from both evolution supporters and intelligent design/creationism advocates clearly. You include case law, quotes, and reactions from various perspectives (legal, religious, parental, media) which strengthens your analysis.

3. **Integration of Sources:**  
   The use of cited sources, including Wikipedia, court documents, and news articles, supports your points and adds credibility. You also refer to relevant organizations (Discovery Institute, ACLU) and activists.

4. **Personal Reflection:**  
   Including your personal viewpoint and the story about your uncle adds a human element to the analysis. It demonstrates that this issue isn’t just academic—it impacts individual lives and beliefs.

5. **Coverage of Definitions and Controversies:**  
   You explain how confusion around the definitions of “evolution” contributes to controversy, and you elucidate the “teach the controversy” approach.

**Areas for Improvement**

1. **Organization & Flow:**  
   - The paper sometimes feels like a summary of facts rather than a cohesive argument. Consider adding clearer transitions and topic sentences to guide the reader through your claims and evidence.
   - Try to clarify your thesis in the introduction: Are you arguing for a specific policy (e.g., for or against teaching intelligent design) or mainly analyzing the conflict? Right now, the introduction suggests analysis, but the conclusion is more opinionated.

2. **Depth of Analysis:**  
   - While you summarize the legal battles well, the analysis of why these tensions persist—and their broader social consequences—could be deepened. For instance, you could further explore why grassroots efforts succeed or fail, or how American views on science/religion have shifted over time.

3. **Source Reliability:**  
   - Wikipedia is fine for background, but academic papers benefit from more primary and scholarly sources (peer-reviewed articles, books, court transcripts). Consider replacing some Wikipedia citations with more authoritative texts.

4. **Counterargument & Nuance:**  
   - The conclusion leans heavily on a fear that “God is being pushed out” of public life, but could benefit from acknowledging opposing viewpoints with more nuance. For example, discuss why some advocate for strict secularism and why others see this as a protection rather than a threat.

5. **Clarity & Precision:**  
   - Be careful with wording like “religion has been replaced” at the University of Michigan; clarify that it may refer to departmental changes, not the absence of religious studies or student faith life.
   - In places, your tone shifts from objective to highly subjective. While personal narrative is valuable, be careful to distinguish your analysis from opinion.

6. **Citation Format:**  
   - Your Works Cited list is comprehensive, but make sure you use a consistent citation style (MLA, APA, etc.), and check for accuracy and formatting issues such as URL breaks.

7. **Conclusion:**  
   - The call-to-action at the end (“parents and students will need to organize and work through the courts and the media...”) would be stronger if tied directly to earlier analysis. Consider reinforcing your main findings and suggesting actionable, realistic next steps.

**Summary/Overall Impression**

You present a well-researched, thorough overview of the evolution vs. intelligent design debate in U.S. public education, grounded in important legal history and public reaction. The paper could be improved by sharpening its thesis, deepening analysis, improving organization and transitions, and relying more on scholarly sources. Balancing your personal perspective with critical analysis of all sides will make your argument even more compelling and academically robust.

**Suggested Grade Range:**  
If this were for a college-level course, this paper would likely fall into the B to A- range depending on the course rubric, particularly if revised for organization and scholarly depth.
