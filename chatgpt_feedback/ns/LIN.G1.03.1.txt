Absolutely! Here’s detailed and constructive feedback on your paper “A Discussion of the VP-External and VP-Internal Subjects Hypotheses,” considering content, organization, argumentation, use of sources, and clarity:

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clarity of Purpose**
You clearly articulate the goal of your paper in the introduction: to explore the benefits and drawbacks of the VP-external and VP-internal hypotheses using both theoretical and empirical criteria. This sets expectations for the reader and frames the discussion well.

### 2. **Organization and Flow**
The paper is well-organized and flows logically:
- Introduction of the two hypotheses with diagrams.
- Step-by-step exploration (theta-role assignment, floating quantifiers, PRO).
- Use of clear examples (e.g., “Norman will kick the ball”) and corresponding tree diagrams to illustrate key syntactic points.
- A summary and strong conclusion.

### 3. **Depth of Discussion**
You thoughtfully discuss both theoretical motivations (like the elegance of theta-role assignment within the m-command domain) and empirical motivations (the distribution of floating quantifiers, following Sportiche).

### 4. **Integration of Literature**
The discussion is well-anchored in the literature (Chomsky, Lasnik, Sportiche, etc.), and relevant citations are provided. The referencing style is consistent and appropriate for an academic linguistics paper.

### 5. **Argumentation**
You fairly consider the advantages and disadvantages of both hypotheses before reaching a reasoned conclusion. This is a mark of strong academic writing.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Technical Detail and Accessibility**
- While the technical detail is appropriate for a graduate-level paper, consider briefly introducing or reminding the reader of technical terms as they arise (e.g., m-command, government, Spec, IP, etc.), especially for readers who may need a refresher.
- For sentences like, “We will be working with the assumption that theta roles are assigned by mutual m-command,” a brief explanation or citation for “mutual m-command” would help.

### 2. **Explaining Diagrams**
- You consistently include and reference tree diagrams, which is excellent. However, sometimes the text assumes the reader can easily interpret these trees. Each time a diagram is introduced, explicitly summarize its key message and how it visually supports the discussion.

### 3. **Transitions and Explicit Contrasts**
- Some transitions between points could be clearer, particularly when summarizing why one hypothesis is less preferable than the other in a given context. Explicit sentences that highlight these contrasts help reinforce your argument: e.g., “While the VP-external hypothesis avoids subject movement, it introduces undesirable complexity in theta-role assignment…”

### 4. **Empirical Issues**
- The discussion of English versus French floating quantifiers is strong, but you leave the English data somewhat unresolved. While it’s accurate to say Sportiche’s account is imperfect for English, acknowledging any major alternative proposals for English more explicitly would be ideal.
- Similarly, when you discuss PRO and its problems, you might more clearly summarize, at the end of the relevant section, why the issues with PRO do not decisively settle the debate between hypotheses (flaws remain in both, as you note).

### 5. **Stylistic Adjustment**
- There are a few places where sentences could be tightened for clarity and conciseness. For example:
  - Instead of “An appeal of the VP-internal subjects hypothesis put forward in Sportiche’s paper is that these two conditions, (3) and (4), follow from it,” try “A key advantage of Sportiche’s VP-internal subjects hypothesis is that it naturally accounts for conditions (3) and (4).”
  - Some sentences are long and complex; breaking them up improves readability.

### 6. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion is strong but could be even more impactful by restating the most significant finding and briefly suggesting areas for future research or implications for syntactic theory.

## Overall Assessment

This is a strong graduate-level paper: clear, organized, thoughtful, and well-integrated with the literature. With some minor improvements in writing style, technical exposition for accessibility, and explicit transitional statements, it could be even stronger. Your conclusion, that the VP-internal hypothesis is preferable based on theoretical and empirical grounds, is well supported.
