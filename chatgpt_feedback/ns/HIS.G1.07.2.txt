Absolutely! This is a thoughtful and well-developed graduate-level history paper that critically examines the concept of capitalism as a historical agent in Michel Foucault and William Cronon’s works. Below, I’ll provide both overall impressions and specific, actionable feedback:

---

### **Strengths**

**1. Clear Thesis and Organization:**  
You articulate a focused thesis at the outset: examining points where capitalism is a historical agent for Foucault, comparing with Cronon, and stressing the need to interrogate how capitalism gains its agentic power.

**2. Effective Use of Sources:**  
You engage closely with Foucault’s *Discipline and Punish* and Cronon’s *Nature’s Metropolis*. Quotations are judicious and well-explained, demonstrating an advanced level of reading comprehension.

**3. Thematic Depth:**  
Your exploration of “discipline,” the timetable, surveillance mechanisms, and the Panopticon, shows strong thematic engagement. You effectively link the conceptual development of disciplinary mechanisms to the requirements of capitalist economy.

**4. Comparative Analysis:**  
The comparison with Cronon adds value, highlighting that both authors attribute agency to capitalism rather than to individuals, while also noting methodological differences (theoretical vs. historical specificity).

**5. Critical Perspective:**  
You challenge the “ahistorical” treatment of capitalism as an impersonal force and argue for historicizing its origins—this is a sophisticated and perceptive critique that expands the discussion.

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Clarity and Style:**
- At times, some sentences are a bit dense. For example, complex clauses can make your argument harder to follow. Try to simplify where possible and break up long sentences.
- Consider removing “in this essay I am particularly concerned with…” and just launch into your analysis; such signposting is less needed at this level if your structure is tight.

**2. Engagement with Agency:**
- While you raise the question of human agency sharply at the end, you might briefly gesture (even speculatively) at possible answers or areas for further research. For instance, were merchants, bureaucrats, or reformers deciding to implement disciplining techniques? Even if Foucault doesn’t focus there, a mention of such debates would show engagement with scholarly discourse beyond the immediate text.

**3. Integration of Cronon:**
- Your analysis of Cronon, while concise, could benefit from further depth. As is, it reads somewhat summary-like. Are there more nuanced ways Cronon deals with agency or resistance you could draw out?

**4. More Direct Argumentation:**
- At a few points, you could be more explicit in drawing connections: *how* exactly does the historical rise of these disciplines relate to the economics of capitalism? You hint at it, and often let Foucault’s quotations carry the weight—don’t be afraid to paraphrase and analyze more.

**5. Citations:**
- The citations themselves (as numbered) work for this assignment, but in other contexts, you may wish to use full footnotes or parenthetical citations (as Chicago or another style requires).

### **Minor Suggestions**

- Proofread for small typographical issues (e.g., “jut as they please” on the first page—presumably “just”).
- When summarizing arguments (Foucault, Cronon), sometimes use introductory phrases (“Foucault contends that…”) to clarify whose perspective is being presented.
- The conclusion is strong, but consider sharpening the “so what?” by briefly noting *contemporary* relevance. Why does re-examining the origins of capitalism matter for today’s social or political debates?

### **Sample Revision**

**Original:**  
“Such a conception of capitalism, however, is ahistorical: although the developmental process of the capitalist world system is described in detail, no attention is given to the original development of capitalism as an entity, economic system or worldview.”

**Possible Revision:**  
“However, this treatment of capitalism as an impersonal force risks becoming ahistorical. While both authors detail the expansion of the capitalist world system, they overlook the contingent and contested processes by which capitalism itself emerged as both an economic system and a worldview—an omission that limits our understanding of historical agency.”

### **Summary**

This is an excellent critical paper: ambitious, tightly argued, and engaged with major theorists. With minor stylistic tweaks, deeper engagement with agency, and a slightly sharper connection between your critique and the authors’ texts, it would be ready for submission at a high academic level.

**Great work! Let me know if you’d like a more detailed, line-by-line edit or any specific examples of how to rework sections.**
