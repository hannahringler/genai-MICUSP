## Overall Assessment

This is a nuanced, thoughtful essay that makes an interesting comparison between Marlowe’s *Doctor Faustus* and Shakespeare’s *The Tempest*, specifically focusing on the nature of magic, the pursuit of knowledge, and the moral decisions of the protagonists. Your engagement with both texts is deep and analytical, and you demonstrate a clear understanding of both plays’ themes and broader literary/cultural contexts.

---

## Strengths

**1. Insightful Argument:**
You go beyond surface-level comparison, delving into the philosophical and religious implications underlying each character’s actions. Your framing of Faustus and Prospero’s differing attitudes toward power and humanism is compelling.

**2. Close Reading:**
You incorporate well-chosen quotations and analyze them deftly. For example, your unpacking of Faustus’s and Prospero's respective attitudes toward their books of magic and the significance of burning/drowning them is especially strong.

**3. Organization and Progression:**
The essay moves logically from background/thematic similarities to character analysis, then to the moral and existential crises faced by each, ending with the consequences and lessons implied by the texts.

**4. Writing Style:**
Your prose is generally polished and mature, and your sentences are varied and engaging. Complex points are handled with clarity and sophistication.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### Thesis and Introduction

- **Thesis Statement:** 
  - Your introduction starts by comparing *The Jew of Malta* and *The Merchant of Venice*, which is interesting but somewhat distracts from your main topic. Consider either trimming this or more clearly connecting it to your argument about *Faustus* and *The Tempest*.
  - Your thesis (the final sentences of your first paragraph) could be sharpened. Try to make it more explicit—exactly *how* do Faustus and Prospero's choices regarding magic reflect their attitudes toward knowledge, power, and morality?

> *Suggestion:*
> Condense the first paragraph and end with a sharper thesis, e.g.:  
> *"While both Faustus and Prospero turn to magic to transcend the limits of human knowledge and power, Marlowe’s protagonist pursues diabolic power at the cost of his soul, rejecting human and divine order, whereas Shakespeare’s magician ultimately renounces magic to embrace a humanist reconciliation with mortality and moral responsibility."*

### Evidence and Analysis

- **Balance of Textual Evidence:**
  - You use strong textual evidence throughout. Occasionally, passages are quoted at length without enough subsequent unpacking (e.g., the long Prospero quote, p.4). Always follow up longer quotations with focused analysis of the *specific* language and its implications.

- **Historical/Philosophical Context:**
  - You gesture towards Faustus’s “anti-Christian” perspective and Prospero’s humanism. Briefly clarifying (in a sentence or two) what you mean by “anti-Christian” vs. “humanist” for your reader—contextualizing them against Renaissance thought—could help solidify your analysis.

### Structure and Repetition

- **Paragraphing:**
  - Some paragraphs are quite long (especially pp.2–4). Consider breaking them up to help readers follow your argument more easily.

- **Repetition:**
  - Occasionally, points are repeated with slight rephrasing. For instance, that Faustus seeks ultimate power despite intellectual achievement, and that Prospero attains magic through study but ultimately rejects it for human concerns, occurs a few times. Aim for *development* rather than repetition of ideas.

### Clarity and Style

- **Transitions:**
  - Some paragraph transitions could be smoother. For example, when moving from discussing Faustus to Prospero, signpost more clearly for the reader.

- **Syntax:**
  - You generally write well, but review sentences for conciseness and clarity. A few sentences are a bit convoluted and might benefit from trimming and restructuring.

- **Citations:**
  - You cite passages well internally. Make sure your final Works Cited matches the required style guide for your assignment.

### Conclusion

- Your conclusion insightfully resists reducing the plays to simple “morals”—excellent. It might be strengthened by briefly restating your main comparative claim, emphasizing what your analysis reveals about early modern conceptions of knowledge, magic, and humanity.

## Minor Edits

- Double-check for typos and grammatical errors—very few, but a quick proofread is always good.
- Make sure stage directions and act/scene citations (for Shakespeare) match your cited edition’s conventions.
