Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, **“Defining Wild Nature: A brief study of H. D. Thoreau, Gary Snyder, Robert Frost, and Mary Oliver.”** I will address **organization, argumentation, evidence, writing style, and areas for improvement**.

## Overall Strengths

### 1. Ambitious and Thoughtful Engagement
Your paper takes on a complex and multifaceted subject—defining “wildness” in the works of influential writers—and you fully embrace its nuances and contradictions. You contextualize these writers within broader literary and philosophical traditions, showing excellent critical thinking.

### 2. Strong Use of Sources and Integration
You use a variety of primary sources and secondary commentary, from Thoreau’s “Walking” to legal documents like The Wilderness Act to the poetry of Oliver and Frost. You handle quotations and paraphrasing adeptly, often linking them back to your own analysis.

### 3. Analytical Depth
You move beyond summary to interrogate the language, etymology, and philosophical implications of "wildness." Your attention to *ferity*, *self-willed*, and the different writers’ attitudes toward the wild vs. civilization is insightful and demonstrates a high level of literary analysis.

### 4. Clear Structure and Transitions
Though your topic is broad, your transitions between literary figures and ideas are mostly smooth. The progression from Thoreau and Snyder, to Frost and Oliver, to the Wilderness Act works well, creating a logical flow of the development of “wildness” as a concept.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Thesis Statement and Framing
While your introduction effectively lays out the complexity of defining “wild,” your main argument could be a bit sharper and more explicit. State as early as possible (and reiterate later) *what* you think these writers agree/disagree on, or why tracing this evolving concept is important—beyond it being “fruitful.”

**Suggestion:**  
Consider summarizing in one or two sentences: *What, if anything, do these writers collectively reveal about “wildness” that is unexpected or essential for “contemporary Americans?”* This would offer a clearer through-line for readers.

---

### 2. Focus and Cohesion
Although the essay’s breadth is a strength, at times the paper risks becoming a survey rather than a sustained argument. For example, the section about the legal language of the Wilderness Act is interesting, but less closely tied to the literary analysis.

**Suggestion:**  
- At the end of each section, explicitly tie it back to your thesis or main question.  
- When comparing writers, highlight their key agreements/disagreements in a sentence or two at natural transitions.

---

### 3. Depth with Minor Authors (Frost, Oliver)
Your treatment of Frost and Oliver is less developed than Thoreau and Snyder, and Frost in particular serves mainly as an illustration rather than a subject of deep analysis.

**Suggestion:**  
- Consider either expanding these sections—how do their poems either echo or challenge the philosophies of Thoreau and Snyder?  
- Or, make it clear that Frost/Oliver are representative voices and focus your principal argument on Thoreau and Snyder.

---

### 4. Clarification of Terminology
You do a good job parsing terms like “ferity,” “wildness,” and “wilderness,” but sometimes the overlap of terms (especially as used differently by Snyder, Thoreau, and law) could confuse readers.

**Suggestion:**  
- Early in the paper, define the distinctions you’ll use for “wildness,” “wilderness,” and “nature.”  
- If using them interchangeably with poet’s intent, flag for the reader when you’re switching definitions.

---

### 5. Concluding Section
Your final paragraph is a bit rushed—after such a rich analysis, the paper would benefit from a reflective synthesis that more directly answers the questions raised in your introduction.

**Suggestion:**  
- Revisit the opening questions.  
- Briefly state how your exploration has developed/challenged/complicated your understanding of “wildness.”
- Suggest why these definitions *matter* today (for environmental thought, identity, or policy, etc.).

---

## Writing Style & Mechanics

- **Generally, your prose is clear and thoughtful.** There are some long sentences that could be broken up for clarity.
- A few places would benefit from more concise wording.
- Use of endnotes/footnotes is good, but ensure formatting is consistent.
- Watch for typographical errors (e.g., bracketed [sic] may not be necessary unless you are correcting an error in a quotation).
