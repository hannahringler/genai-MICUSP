Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback focusing on the structure, content, clarity, and strengths/areas for improvement of this political science proposal:

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Clear Research Question and Significance**
- The core research question (“Does merely priming a common outgroup shift attitudes among conflicting groups?”) is timely and significant, especially given ongoing debates about intergroup relations.
- Explains real-world relevance (e.g., post-9/11 New York, LA mayoral election), anchoring the study in recent history and familiar cases.

### 2. **Comprehensive Literature Review**
- Thoroughly covers key theoretical frameworks—realistic group conflict, group position, symbolic racism, and social identity theories.
- Cites influential studies (Sherif’s Robber’s Cave, Brophy on merchant seamen, Traugott et al. on 9/11 effects) supporting the theoretical basis for predictions.

### 3. **Methodological Rigor**
- Proposes a multi-experiment design, testing both “subtle” and “explicit” priming across major ethnic/racial groups in the US.
- Attention to randomization, control/treatment groups, and careful operationalization of variables (use of “feeling thermometer,” campaign ad design, etc.).
- Hypotheses are clearly stated and linked back to literature and theory.

### 4. **Acknowledgement of Alternative Explanations and Limitations**
- Recognizes possible outcomes where priming could backfire or simply increase attachment to the immediate ingroup, not just reduce conflict.
- Considers that different groups may respond differently due to pre-existing levels of group consciousness/identity.

## **Areas for Improvement / Questions to Address**

### 1. **Clarity & Structure**
- The paper occasionally becomes dense with theory and literature. Try splitting longer paragraphs and using more subheadings to guide the reader (e.g., “Methodology: Study Design,” “Hypotheses & Expected Outcomes,” etc.).
- Definitions of key terms (e.g., “ingroup,” “outgroup,” “priming”) could be provided early to orient readers from non-social psychology backgrounds.

### 2. **Operationalization / Manipulation of Primes**
- The “subtle” and “explicit” primes rely on specific media examples (e.g., country club ad, gang news). Consider pre-testing these for effectiveness and potential unintended confounds (e.g., stereotypes in media that could bias results in unexpected ways).
- Are there risks the primes could trigger backlash or additional negative stereotypes rather than fostering unity (especially with “explicit threat” primes featuring crime/gang content)?

### 3. **Measurement and Survey Design**
- Feeling thermometers are good, but consider supplementing with more nuanced measures (e.g., Implicit Association Test, open-ended questions about candidate perceptions).
- How is group identity measured? The proposal references “attachment to the ingroup,” but the exact survey items could be described in an appendix or referenced.

### 4. **Sampling Concerns**
- Who will the subjects be (college students? Community sample? Recruitment methods? Size of each group?) since results may differ by geography, socioeconomic status, or age.
- Potential limitations in generalizability should be discussed.

### 5. **Ethical Concerns**
- Priming intergroup threat—especially with sensitive content (affirmative action, immigration, crime)—can have ethical implications. Consider IRB safeguards and debriefing for participants.

### 6. **Future Research and Policy Implications**
- Nicely positioned, but could benefit from a clearer discussion of what positive applications *look like*, and how findings might help reduce intergroup animosity in practice, not merely describe mechanisms for manipulating group attitudes.

## **Stylistic/Formatting Suggestions**

- Use more frequent citations within paragraphs for precision, especially when articulating highly contested points.
- Table/figure references (as in Appendix A) are helpful—consider integrating a visual flowchart or model summarizing the experimental design earlier in the main text.

## **Overall Assessment**

**This proposal demonstrates strong command of the literature, thoughtful experimental design, and a real-world grounding in contemporary group relations.** With some additional clarifications on operationalization, ethical safeguards, and sampling strategy, it would be ready for IRB review or submission as a grant proposal or thesis project.
