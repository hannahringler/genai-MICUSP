Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback review of your paper, organized by sections that highlight your strengths, point out any weaknesses, and offer suggestions for enhancement.

### **Strengths**

**1. Clear Structure and Organization**
- Your essay is logically organized, with clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Each paragraph focuses on a particular theme or comparison, making your argument easy to follow.

**2. Effective Use of Evidence**
- You make excellent use of direct quotes from Greg Michie’s _Holler if You Hear Me_ and reference Noguera’s _City Schools and the American Dream_ effectively. These textual evidences strongly support your arguments.

**3. Thoughtful Analysis**
- The essay demonstrates a nuanced understanding of both texts. You delve into the implications of teachers listening to students, attending to the broader contexts of students’ lives, and the impact of caring adults.

**4. Personal Reflection**
- Your reflections about hopefulness as a future educator add a compelling, personal touch. This perspective is effective in showing how academic texts relate to your own evolving educational philosophy.

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Thesis Clarity**
- While your introduction is engaging and generally clear, your main argument (thesis) could be stated more explicitly. Consider clearly articulating, by the end of your introduction, exactly how Michie’s insights provide more hope for reform than Noguera’s—what specifically makes them more actionable or inspiring for you as a prospective teacher?

**2. Transitions and Flow**
- The transitions between some sections are abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing Michie’s insights to comparing them with Noguera’s could be smoother. Consider adding transition sentences that bridge your discussion points more clearly.

**3. Engagement with Counterarguments**
- While you discuss feelings of powerlessness in response to Noguera’s approach, you might strengthen your analysis by considering possible strengths of Noguera’s broader, systemic approach, even if ultimately you find Michie’s more hopeful. This would demonstrate critical engagement and strengthen your argument.

**4. Minor Stylistic Edits**
- There are minor grammar or phrasing issues (e.g., “ourselfs” in the student quote—though it is probably quoted as written, clarify with [sic] if it's a direct quote with a misspelling).
- Some sentences could be more concise or combined for flow. For example: “He demonstrates through students’ first-hand accounts that many middle-schoolers have hopes and dreams that are sabotaged by these life circumstances.” This could be reworded for clarity: “Through his students’ first-hand accounts, Michie demonstrates how these life circumstances can undermine the hopes and dreams of many middle-schoolers.”
- Be consistent when you introduce works. For instance, you sometimes refer to Michie’s book as _Holler if You Hear Me_ and sometimes just _Holler_. That’s fine, but make sure it’s clear to the reader from the start.

**5. Broadened Citations**
- While you refer to additional scholars (Anyon, Noguera), their inclusion could be slightly more pointed, with a brief explanation of their relevance—to show you’re not just name-dropping, but actually connecting to broader readings.

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a strong and thoughtful argumentative essay. Your engagement with the texts is insightful and personal, and you do well to anchor your analysis in concrete examples both from the texts and from your own aspirations as an educator. With a slightly clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and a bit more critical engagement with opposing views, your excellent analysis would be even more compelling.

**Final Tips:**  
- Add a sentence or two to your introduction that clearly lays out your main argument.
- Use transition phrases to guide your reader from one idea into the next.
- Consider and address counterarguments, even briefly.
- Proofread for minor style and grammar issues, checking quotes and formatting.

**Great work—keep it up!**
