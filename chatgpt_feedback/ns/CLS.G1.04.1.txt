Absolutely! Below is detailed feedback on your essay, “The Bellum Hispaniense as a Face of Battle Narrative,” with suggestions for improvement, highlighting its strengths, and some notes on structure, argument, and style. The feedback is organized into categories for clarity:

---

### **Overall Impression**
This paper is a well-researched, thoughtful, and analytically sophisticated piece on a nuanced topic. You engage actively with modern scholarly debates (Keegan, Kagan), integrate ancient sources well, and present a strong argument for rereading the **Bellum Hispaniense** as a “face of battle” narrative rather than a war commentary. The choice to shift the focus from grand strategy to the day-to-day and small-scale experience of a junior officer is compelling and well-defended.

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Engagement with Scholarship**  
   - You summarize major scholarly works concisely (Keegan, Kagan, etc.) and set up your argument in response to them.
   - The footnotes and bibliography are thorough, indicating a deep engagement with both primary texts and secondary literature.

2. **Clarity of Argument**  
   - The thesis (that the Bellum Hispaniense should be read as a “face of battle” narrative rather than a strategic commentary) is clear and well-supported.
   - You justify your methodology explicitly (e.g., focusing on “trivialities”/small-scale operations for their interpretive value).

3. **Use of Evidence**  
   - Effective incorporation and explanation of primary sources, with apt quotations and good translation.
   - Sound attention to details from the text supporting your argument about the perspective and intent of the author.

4. **Structure and Flow**  
   - The paper is logically organized: Introduction → Historiographical Context → Close Reading/Analysis → Conclusion.
   - Section transitions are generally smooth and signposted.

### **Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

1. **Thesis Placement and Signposting**
   - The thesis emerges clearly, but it could be made even more explicit in the very opening paragraph, so the reader knows straight away what your stance is.
   - Occasionally, paragraphs become long and could benefit from internal signposting and topic sentences. Consider breaking up denser sections for greater readability.

2. **Balance of Summary vs. Analysis**
   - At times, early sections spend a bit too much time summarizing Keegan/Kagan. Shorten these slightly to allow room for your own analysis.
   - When referencing modern critics who fault the **Bellum Hispaniense** for lack of strategic analysis, directly quote their criticisms more concisely and pivot quickly to your rebuttal.

3. **Close Reading**
   - Fantastic work with specific examples from the text (double-mounting, cavalry action, etc.). You could foreground the *effect* this narrative approach has on readers’ understanding—how does seeing the war through the eyes of a low-level officer change our perception of Roman warfare, leadership, or morale?

4. **Bringing out Implications**
   - In your conclusion, take a sentence or two to broaden the implications: What does your reading tell us about ancient historiography as a whole? About the role of “minor” tactics? About the social or psychological experience of Roman soldiers? Don’t be afraid to speculate briefly about larger stakes.

5. **Style and Mechanics**
   - There are a few typographical/phrasing oddities (e.g., “his account of the last action” should probably be “his account of the last actions”).
   - Consider varying sentence lengths in some places for flow.
   - Some in-text citations can disrupt the flow; in a revised draft, move these to footnotes if possible for easier reading.

6. **Potential Additions**
   - You might mention, even briefly, the literary quality of the **Bellum Hispaniense**—is the “face of battle” style unique in Latin military narrative, or part of a trend?
   - It may be worth reflecting on the possible limitations or biases of a junior officer’s perspective (e.g., narrow focus, potential for exaggeration, or limited knowledge).

### **Minor Corrections**

- **Footnotes:** In the main text, make sure references are consistently formatted.
- **Quotations:** For all Latin or Greek passages, a translation (as you’ve done) is excellent. Ensure all are included for non-specialist readers.
- **Grammar/Typo:** Watch for comma placement and sentence fragment issues, e.g.: “but once there the light-armed troops were no match...” could be “but, once there, the light-armed troops were no match…”

---

### **Conclusion**
This is an excellent, original, and well-argued paper. It demonstrates strong command of ancient sources and modern historiography, and your argument is both clear and significant. A bit of tightening for concision, organization of scholarly summary, and more explicit signposting of your argument in the introduction will make it even stronger.
