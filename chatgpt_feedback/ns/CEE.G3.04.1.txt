## Overall Feedback

### 1. **Thesis and Purpose**
- **Strengths:**  
  The paper clearly identifies a relevant and pressing issue: the management of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) and their regulatory and grassroots controls. The thesis is evident early on—CAFOs are problematic, and both regulatory and grassroots approaches are needed for effective management.
- **Suggestion:**  
  The thesis could be made even more explicit in the introduction; consider a sentence that directly states what your paper will argue or demonstrate regarding CAFO management.

### 2. **Organization and Structure**
- **Strengths:**  
  - The structure follows an effective logical progression: introduction, environmental impacts, effects on rural economies, regulatory framework, enforcement, local example (Pampa), and finally, recommendations and future prospects.
  - Clear section headings (“CAFOs in the Environment,” “CAFOs and Rural Economies,” etc.) guide the reader.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - An abstract or brief overview up front could help orient the reader.
  - Consider a short concluding section that synthesizes your main findings and offers policy or practical recommendations.

### 3. **Development and Use of Evidence**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Evidence and citations are abundant and cover a range of perspectives—scientific, regulatory, economic, and citizen/grassroots viewpoints.
  - Good balance of qualitative (citations from news editorials and public opinion) and quantitative/scientific (data from EPA, USGS, academic studies) evidence.
- **Suggestion:**
  - Ensure consistent integration and explanation of citations: after introducing a statistic or quote, summarize its importance in your own words to reinforce your analysis.
  - Where possible, connect data or arguments directly back to your main thesis.

### 4. **Clarity and Academic Style**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Writing is generally clear, well-organized, and avoids unnecessary jargon.
  - Good use of quotation and paraphrase. The text incorporates humor and local color through direct quotes, making it engaging.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Occasionally, long sentences could benefit from being broken up to improve readability.
  - Watch for vague pronoun use (“this,” “these” — clarify what is being referred to).

### 5. **Arguments and Analysis**
- **Strengths:**  
  - The paper critically evaluates both the shortcomings of regulatory solutions and the potential of grassroots activism, rather than presenting only one side.
  - It acknowledges the economic arguments for CAFOs, not just the environmental drawbacks—this shows nuanced understanding.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - The paper could be even stronger by proposing more concrete or innovative solutions, rather than primarily pointing out flaws in the existing system.
  - More explicit discussion of potential trade-offs (economic gains vs. environmental/rural community costs) would be helpful.

### 6. **Use of Sources and Referencing**
- **Strengths:**  
  - The references pages are thorough and formatted appropriately for an engineering or environmental science paper. In-text citations are correctly used.
  - Governmental, scientific, and journalistic sources are well-balanced.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Minor: Double-check citation style (APA, IEEE, etc.) for consistency if required by the assignment.
  - It sometimes helps to distinguish between peer-reviewed sources and opinion/editorial sources in your analysis.

### 7. **Visuals**
- **Strengths:**  
  - The inclusion of an image (with EPA credit) on the title page is engaging and relevant.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Additional figures or tables, such as graphs of water contamination data or maps showing CAFO locations, could further support your arguments and break up the text visually.

### 8. **Conclusion**
- **Strengths:**  
  - The closing remarks about citizen involvement and the importance of caution are persuasive and end on an optimistic, forward-looking note.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Draw your key arguments together in a succinct paragraph and explicitly state your recommendations or what actions should be taken next.

## **Summary**
**This paper demonstrates strong research, sound organization, clear writing, and thoughtful critical analysis.** You cover regulatory, environmental, economic, and social aspects comprehensively and draw on a wide range of credible sources. For even greater impact, make your thesis and recommendations more explicit, tighten prose for clarity, and ensure every piece of evidence is tied clearly to your main argument.
