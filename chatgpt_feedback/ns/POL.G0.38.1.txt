Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on this paper, considering elements such as thesis development, evidence use, organization, clarity, and analysis. This feedback assumes the expectations for a final-year undergraduate research paper in political science.

---

**Title and Introduction:**
- The title is clear and directly presents the focus of the investigation ("Does BCRA really work? An investigation into the Re-election of Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur").
- The introduction is concise and quickly focuses on Congresswoman Kaptur’s background and the political/economic makeup of her district, which is a good foundation for the analysis to come. However, it could be enhanced by more explicitly introducing the BCRA and setting up your main research question or thesis about its effectiveness.

**Thesis and Argument:**
- The central research question—does the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) “work,” at least in the specific case of Kaptur’s fundraising—is implied but not stated as clearly and forcefully as it could be. Consider a more explicit thesis statement that addresses what you expect BCRA to accomplish and how you will evaluate it in Kaptur’s case.

**Use of Evidence and Detail:**
- The paper shows excellent attention to relevant detail. You use Kaptur's campaign finance records to break down contributions (individual, PACs, unitemized donations) and connect them to specific interests and pieces of legislation—a highly effective approach that links money to policy.
- Real-world examples, such as Dennis Johnson and the Maumee Valley Growers or Teledyne Technologies, concretize how donations may be influenced by congressional action.
- There is a good balance of citing both direct monetary data and larger analyses (especially Malbin’s work) on the effects of BCRA.

**Analysis:**
- The analysis is strongest when you connect contributions concretely to Kaptur’s legislative actions or the composition/interests of her district (e.g., union support, agribusiness, and university research funding).
- The examination of the shifts in fundraising post-BCRA, both generally and with reference to Kaptur, is thorough and nuanced. You correctly identify that BCRA “plugged one sort of campaign contribution” but that money quickly found other routes—a common finding in campaign finance research.
- The connection between theory (Malbin’s arguments) and your empirical example (Kaptur) is well-articulated, though at times the evidence could be more critically weighed (for example, discussing if Kaptur is typical or exceptional among House members).

**Organization and Structure:**
- The paper is logically organized—district context and Kaptur’s role, analysis of individual and PAC contributors, discussion of BCRA, and finally, a comparative/interpretive section using time-series fundraising data.
- Some sections, however, are heavy with descriptive detail and could benefit from more explicit analytical transitions or topic sentences that keep the reader focused on the central question: is BCRA effective?

**Use of Sources:**
- Sources (OpenSecrets, VoteSmart, Malbin, etc.) are well-picked and documented.
- Some links in the references are now outdated or incomplete—while this is not the author’s fault, in a present-day revision, condensed citations or DOIs would help ensure future accessibility.
- The references section is comprehensive and appropriate for an academic research paper.

**Clarity and Style:**
- The writing is generally clear, with some long and complex sentences that could be broken down for greater readability.
- Some minor grammatical issues (e.g., verb tense consistency, sentence fragments) can be fixed for a more polished final product.
- Paragraphs sometimes start with specific details instead of topic sentences, impacting the cohesion and readability of sections. Stronger topic sentences would guide the reader better.

**Conclusion:**
- The paper lacks a strong, explicit conclusion. The last section (which interprets Malbin’s analysis in light of Kaptur’s campaign data) drifts into ending without drawing a clear, final answer to the research question.
- Consider adding a brief conclusion that (a) summarizes whether BCRA “worked” in this case and (b) reflects on the larger implications for campaign finance reform more generally.

**Strengths:**
- Uses a detailed, concrete case to illuminate broader questions about money in politics.
- Good, critical engagement with existing literature.
- Rich empirical detail grounded in specific campaign finance data.
- Clearly documented research sources.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Strong, Explicit Thesis:** More clearly and forcefully state your main argument near the opening.
2. **Transitions/Analytical Cohesion:** Guide your reader through the argument more directly with strong topic sentences and transitions.
3. **Conclusion:** Add a brief analytic conclusion tying your findings to the research question and relating the case to broader debates about BCRA.
4. **Polish:** Proofread for sentence structure and clarity; break up long sentences.
5. **Balance Description vs. Analysis:** Sometimes sections are heavy on background; aim for a stronger connection to your central evaluative question.

**Overall Assessment:**  
This is a well-researched, thoughtful case study that successfully connects real campaign finance data to theoretical policy debates. With a more explicit thesis, stronger cohesion, and a clear conclusion, it would be an excellent undergraduate research paper.
