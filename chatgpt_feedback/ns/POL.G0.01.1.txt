Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on the argumentative essay “The Social Impact of Roe v. Wade,” covering strengths and areas for improvement:

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Thorough Historical Context**
The essay does an excellent job of providing historical background, explaining how abortion laws evolved in the U.S. from the 19th century and situating Roe v. Wade in the context of the women’s rights movement. The use of historical sources, including Rubin’s book, is effective and demonstrates strong research skills.

### 2. **Clear Structure and Organization**
Your essay has a logical flow, moving from history, to the rise of the women’s movement, to the legal developments, the Supreme Court decision, and its aftermath. Each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next, making the argument easy to follow.

### 3. **Balanced Presentation**
You acknowledge multiple perspectives—including those of the Pro-Choice and Pro-Life movements, as well as critiques from both sides of the Roe v. Wade decision. This balanced approach strengthens your credibility and shows critical thinking.

### 4. **Use of Evidence**
The essay is well-supported with data (for example, statistics on illegal abortions and maternal deaths), relevant court cases, and the views of various stakeholders. Citations and quotations (e.g., from Lucinda Cisler, Justice Blackmun) add authority.

### 5. **Strong Conclusion**
Your conclusion effectively situates Roe v. Wade as a turning point that did not resolve but rather transformed the abortion debate, highlighting its sociopolitical legacy and the challenges of enforcing judicially-driven social change.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Thesis Statement Clarity**
While your essay provides a rich narrative, the main argument (thesis) is somewhat tucked into the body. **Suggestion:** Consider a more explicit thesis statement early on (e.g., at the end of the introduction), clearly stating your position on the overall social impact of Roe v. Wade.

### 2. **Depth of Analysis in The Aftermath**
You mention that Roe v. Wade led to increased contestation and subsequent legal battles, but the essay could offer a deeper analysis of **why** this decision didn’t settle the debate. Are there broader implications for how social change is pursued in courts versus legislatures? More focus on the societal, cultural, or political shifts post-Roe would add depth.

### 3. **Engagement With Counterarguments**
You report opposing viewpoints but don’t always engage with them analytically. For example, you note the conservative critique that Roe was judicial overreach. **Suggestion:** Briefly assess the merits and limits of this argument to show deeper critical engagement.

### 4. **Contemporary Relevance**
Given the paper is scholarly and historical, it ends before recent developments (such as Dobbs v. Jackson, which overturned Roe in 2022). While this may be outside your assigned scope, a brief statement about the ongoing relevance or recent events could showcase critical awareness—if allowed by your assignment.

### 5. **Minor Stylistic Points**
- A few sentences are overly long or complex (e.g., lists with many commas), which could obscure your point.
- Some wordiness could be trimmed to make the prose sharper and more concise.
- There are occasional minor grammar issues (“began to organize” instead of “began organizing”; “could may be found” instead of “could be found”).

### 6. **Citation Consistency**
You do well to cite your sources, but sometimes the context of quotations is a little vague or the citation blends awkwardly into the sentence. Ensure all direct quotes are clearly integrated and follow your citation style guide consistently.

## Overall Impression

**This is a well-researched, thoughtfully structured, and analytically rich essay that demonstrates a strong understanding of Roe v. Wade’s legal and social impact.** With a more explicit thesis, some tightening of prose, and a deeper dive into the ongoing nature of the debate, this essay could be further strengthened.

**Grade Estimate (if relevant):** A- to A
