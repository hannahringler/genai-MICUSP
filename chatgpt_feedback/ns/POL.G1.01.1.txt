Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, **“Cohabitation in France”**, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, structure, style, and content.

---

### **Strengths**

#### 1. **Clarity of Purpose and Structure**
- The introduction sets out the dual focus of the paper (how figures handled cohabitation and its implications for French governance), which is clear and well-motivated.
- The paper is logically structured, progressing from historical context and constitutional analysis to the powers of the Prime Minister and President, and concluding with foreign/defense policy.

#### 2. **Use of Sources/References**
- The paper is impressively researched, with robust referencing to authoritative books and articles (e.g., Hall, Elgie, Colomer, Menon, Hayward).
- You integrate references smoothly to support your points.

#### 3. **Depth of Analysis**
- The discussion is well-informed and nuanced, especially in sections comparing different periods and the respective powers of the Prime Minister and President.
- You don’t just describe events, but also analyze the institutional changes and their implications.

#### 4. **Balance**
- The paper avoids oversimplification, acknowledging both the gains and limits of power for both executive roles during cohabitation.
- There is a good mix of historical facts, constitutional discussion, and real political examples.

#### 5. **Writing Style**
- The writing is generally clear, mature, and appropriate for a graduate-level politics paper.
- Technical terms (e.g., “domaine réservé”, “cohabitation”) are correctly used and contextualized.

### **Areas for Improvement / Suggestions**

#### 1. **Thesis and Conclusion**
- **Thesis Restatement:** While your dual aims are clear at the outset, your concluding remarks could more explicitly restate your thesis and main findings. Consider finishing with a sharper reflection on what cohabitation reveals about the adaptability or fragility of French semi-presidentialism.
- **Conclusion Length:** The conclusion is a bit abrupt. Expand it slightly to sum up your main arguments and suggest broader implications, or future trends (e.g., whether reforms to synchronize terms will really end cohabitation, or its lessons for other semi-presidential systems).

#### 2. **Transitions and Flow**
- Occasionally, transitions between sections can be abrupt. For example, the shift from the domestic to the foreign policy implications might benefit from a transitional sentence.
- Internal paragraph structure could be tighter in a few places; sometimes, key points are buried mid-paragraph.

#### 3. **Balance in Examples**
- The focus leans heavily on Mitterrand-era cases, with less detail on the later Jospin-Chirac cohabitation. Briefly comparing dynamics in all three periods would further strengthen your argument.

#### 4. **Critical Voice**
- While you summarize scholars’ views effectively, your own critical evaluation (do you agree with the “flexibility and legitimacy” argument? Are changes to the electoral calendar enough to avoid cohabitation?) could be more pronounced.

#### 5. **Stylistic Minorities**
- Occasional sentences run long and could be broken into shorter, more digestible ones.
- There are a few typos and formatting glitches (e.g., “Presiden Mitterrand”), but these are minor and easily fixed.

#### 6. **Gendered Language**
- Double-check for consistent gender-neutral language (e.g., “he or she” in addition to “his or her”), though this is generally handled well.

### **Specific Highlights**

- **Great Insight:** The discussion of the psychological interplay between Chirac and Juppé adds a human dimension.
- **Smart Use of Evidence:** The reference to public opinion polls on cohabitation and the explanation of constitutional mechanisms add credibility.

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a strong, thoughtfully researched graduate paper with analytical depth, good structure, and a mature writing style. With a stronger conclusion and a little more critical evaluation, it would be even better. Well done!

#### **Action Points for Revision:**
1. Expand and sharpen the conclusion.
2. Add more explicit comparison/contrast between all three cohabitation periods.
3. Strengthen transitions between main sections.
4. Consider adding a brief paragraph on what cohabitation in France tells us about semi-presidential government more broadly.
