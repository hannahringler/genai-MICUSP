Absolutely! Here’s some constructive feedback on your paper "Thoughts on Positive Psychology." I’ll break it down into key areas: **content, organization, clarity, style, and mechanics**.

---

### **Strengths**

**1. Insightful Reflection**  
You provide a thoughtful contrast between the negativity often presented in both media and traditional psychology and the refreshing perspective of positive psychology. Your personal experience with the course and the random act of kindness assignment demonstrates genuine engagement.

**2. Personal Connection**  
The anecdote about the pizza is engaging and relatable. It nicely illustrates your point about genuine acts of kindness and selfless giving, making your reflection more vivid and memorable.

**3. Forward-Looking Perspective**  
You discuss how the course has already begun to influence your thinking, not only in daily life but also in shaping your academic interests and research approach. This shows an ability to synthesize and apply what you’ve learned.

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Thesis & Focus**  
While the response is clearly themed around positive psychology and kindness, the main argument could be stated more explicitly in your opening paragraph. For example, you could add a sentence clearly articulating how positive psychology's focus on strengths and kindness is a compelling alternative to pessimism and negativity in societal narratives.

**2. Organization & Transitions**  
Some paragraphs could be better connected. For example, the transition between your positive seminar experiences and your struggles with the kindness assignment is a bit abrupt. Consider using transitional phrases to guide your reader (“Building on the inspiring topics we discuss, I encountered a challenge with our kindness assignment…”).

**3. Depth of Reflection**  
You mention that doing kind acts felt “very pure,” and that expecting reciprocity “mars the good act.” This is intriguing! Expand a bit more—perhaps reflect on why you think this is, or how you might apply this idea beyond the classroom. Delve deeper into your evolving view of altruism.

**4. Specificity**  
You reference media coverage and traditional psychology’s focus on the negative, but you could briefly provide more specific examples or references. Even one or two (“For instance, headlines often emphasize crime statistics while rarely highlighting community successes”) would ground your introductory points.

**5. Mechanics & Style**  
- Watch for minor typos and awkward phrasings (“through out” should be one word: “throughout”).
- Some sentences are quite long; breaking them up would enhance clarity and flow.
- Emoticons ("I'm looking forward to the chocolate tasting :)") are informal; unless required or allowed for the assignment’s tone, you might omit or rephrase in a more academic voice.

**6. Conclusion**  
The final sentences could do more to “close the circle.” Restate your main takeaway: how positive psychology is reframing your orientation towards both academic and personal life.

### **Example Revision of Opening Paragraph:**

*Original*:  
“In watching the news and reading articles online I’ve found that our media is caught in a rut of advertising what is wrong with society. From women and their children being murdered to casualties in the war on terrorism, the sensationalist news coverage showcases a grim world. Much like traditional psychology, a lot of what people are shown in the news is the negative and the positive is left out of the show…”

*Suggested*:  
“Our media landscape is saturated with stories that highlight the tragic and grim aspects of society, from local violence to international conflict. Similarly, traditional psychology has often focused on diagnosing and treating problems, with little attention given to the positive qualities that contribute to human flourishing. In this context, my experience in the Positive Psychology Seminar has been a welcome change, drawing attention to the strengths and kindness that exist in people and the world around us.”
