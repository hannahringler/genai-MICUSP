Absolutely! Here is **detailed feedback** on the paper "Prevention Mechanisms for Clinical and Sub-Clinical Eating Disorders: A Proposal Study." Aspects reviewed include clarity, structure, depth of research, data analysis, and overall effectiveness.

---

### Strengths

**1. Relevance and Rationale:**  
- The paper addresses a critical and timely issue: prevention of eating disorders, particularly among pre-adolescent girls—a group shown to be at high risk.
- The focus on “sub-clinical” symptoms is important, since many individuals fall in this category but still suffer consequences.

**2. Use of Literature:**  
- The introduction does a good job referencing DSM-IV criteria and providing epidemiological context.
- Multiple sources (e.g., Rosen, Stice, Mann, Walcott et al.) are used to show the history of prevention attempts and common sociocultural influences.

**3. Clear Hypothesis:**  
- You clearly state your hypothesis: teaching nutrition to younger girls may reduce anxieties around food and act as a prevention mechanism.

**4. Original Data Collection:**  
- Surveys via smartgirl.org show initiative and provide preliminary evidence from the actual population of interest.
- You present clear survey questions and basic statistical analysis, such as Pearson correlations and chi-square tests.

**5. Practical Proposal:**  
- There’s a good translation of findings into next steps: a multi-faceted educational project tailored to the needs and preferences of the target demographic.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Writing Style, Organization, and Flow**  
- The introduction integrates a lot of data at once; consider breaking up the background into shorter paragraphs with clear topic sentences.
- Be careful with phrasing (“The goal of the survey on smartgirl.org was to evaluate the interest in body image, nutrition and surrounding issues” is a bit vague—try to be more specific).
- Some sentences are long and could be broken up for clarity.

**2. Depth of Literature Review**  
- While you mention causes and risk factors, the literature review could better highlight what has and hasn’t worked in prevention, and how your proposal fits into or differs from existing approaches.
- Expand on why existing programs fail—are they too generic? Do they ignore cultural aspects? Are they not evaluated rigorously?

**3. Methods Section**  
- More detail is needed: how was the survey designed? Were questions based on prior validated instruments, or were they newly created?
- Sampling: how were Smart Girl members recruited or informed? What is the estimated age range?
- Statistical analysis: The Pearson correlation and chi-square test are a good start, but consider including effect sizes or explanation of practical significance.

**4. Results**  
- Tables are referenced, but some of the figures are only briefly discussed. Interpret the data—what does a correlation of -.49 mean in real terms?
- “Clearly a majority of Smart Girl members are preoccupied with gaining weight,”—is this surprising? How does it compare to national data?
- Consider limitations of self-selection and interpretation of survey items.

**5. Limitations and Implications**  
- You mention limitations in the discussion, but consider suggesting how to overcome them in future research (e.g., better demographic data, multiple sites, longitudinal tracking).
- Discuss possible obstacles to program implementation (e.g., parent buy-in, school policies).

**6. Citations and APA Style**  
- The references are formatted closely to APA, but ensure consistency (e.g., italics for journal titles, correct use of ampersands, etc.).
- Double-check in-text citation format, especially for direct quotes.

**7. Discussion and Future Directions**  
- The discussion is promising but could be expanded: What would success look like for your intervention? How could it be measured?
- Mention of emotional eating and positive framing is good; give an example or outline of a module for clarity.

### Overall Evaluation

**Grade Estimate:**  
- This reads as a **strong upper-level undergraduate proposal**, showing initiative, research, and clarity of purpose.  
- Addressing the organizational and methodological details would move it closer to the level expected for honors or graduate work.

**Summary of Edits/Next Steps:**
- Clarify and expand methods.
- Deepen and organize the literature review.
- Interpret results more fully.
- Tighten up writing for clarity and flow.
- Update APA references as needed.
- Expand on how your intervention will address the gaps in current prevention practices.

**Encouragement:**  
- You have a strong start and a great idea. With some added polish and deeper engagement with methodological detail, this could be a model proposal!
