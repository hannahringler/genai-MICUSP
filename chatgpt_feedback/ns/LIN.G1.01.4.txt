Absolutely! Here’s a comprehensive feedback on your paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

---

## Strengths

**1. Clear Structure and Organization:**
- Your paper follows an excellent structure: Introduction, Methods, Results (with clear subheadings), Conclusions, and Appendix. This organization helps the reader follow your argument and findings very easily.

**2. Well-Stated Hypothesis:**
- The introduction presents a clear and testable hypothesis about the nature of stress in Meglen Vlach and aligns it with existing knowledge (comparison to English stress).

**3. Rigorous Methodology:**
- Your experimental design is clearly described. You provide details about the wordlist, recording environment, and the Praat script used for analysis. The explanation regarding annotation and measurement procedures is thorough.

**4. Quantitative Results:**
- Tables are used effectively to summarize numerical outcomes. You give not only the raw values but also percentage increases, making the impact of stress on each measured feature explicit.

**5. Data Visualization:**
- Including a formant chart demonstrates the vowel space and visualizes the centralization effect succinctly.

**6. Critical Analysis:**
- You discuss not just the general trends, but also inconsistencies and possible reasons (e.g., the less clear reduction for [i], variation in [A]).

**7. Replicability:**
- The inclusion of your Praat script in the appendix significantly improves the replicability of your results.

## Areas for Improvement and Suggestions

**1. Literature Review:**
- The introduction could be strengthened by a brief review of past research on stress in related languages or on stress realization cross-linguistically, even if just a paragraph or a couple of references.

**2. Motivation and Broader Implications:**
- While you mention similarities to English stress, you do not elaborate much on the linguistic or theoretical implications of your findings (e.g., what this means for the typology of stress systems, are Vlach and English stress similar due to areal factors, historical development, etc.).

**3. Statistical Analysis:**
- You report means and percentage changes, but there’s no mention of statistical significance tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.). Even with limited data, presenting any inferential statistics would strengthen your claims.

**4. Sample Size and Speaker Variation:**
- The experiment uses a single speaker. Acknowledge this limitation and any potential consequences more explicitly. If possible, compare with findings from other speakers (even if citing other work).

**5. Vowel Quality Section:**
- While you discuss some overlap and inconsistencies, a deeper linguistic analysis of why, say, [i] resists reduction, would enrich the discussion (e.g., is this a general pattern in unstressed high front vowels in related dialects?).

**6. Figures and Tables:**
- Consider giving each table and figure a more informative caption, describing what main point should be noticed. In the figure, perhaps color-coding or labeling could further aid clarity.

**7. Writing and Style:**
- The text is clear, but at times there is redundancy in the explanation (e.g., reiterating that the word list was randomized). You might be able to streamline a bit for conciseness.
- Proofread for minor typographical errors and formatting (e.g., standardization of italicizing technical terms, consistent treatment of in-text citations if you add any).

**8. Theoretical Context (if appropriate):**
- How do your findings fit with phonological theories of stress? Even a short paragraph on this would help contextualize your results for a broader linguistics audience.

## Overall Assessment

**This is a well-constructed and thoughtful experimental paper.**  
Your methodology is rigorous, your data presentation is clear, and your results directly address your research questions. With a few improvements—most critically, adding context from prior research, statistical testing, and a more explicit theoretical framing—your paper would be suitable for submission to a conference or for a course portfolio.

**Keep up the great work! If you’d like, I can help you draft specific sections (such as a short literature review or conclusion tying the findings to theory) or help you with statistical analysis.**
