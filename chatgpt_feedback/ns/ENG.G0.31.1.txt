Certainly! Here’s **detailed feedback** on your paper, both in terms of content/argumentation and writing style/organization.

---

## Content & Argumentation

### Strengths

1. **Clear Thesis & Focus**
   - Your central argument—that conflicting forms of inheritance (land, knowledge, and family secrets) shape the fates and ethical choices of Cass and Isaac in *Go Down, Moses*—is well-articulated and carries through the essay.

2. **Strong Textual Evidence**
   - You use quotations and references to key moments in Faulkner’s text, such as the ledgers, the land dispute, and the characters’ upbringings, to support your points.
   - The use of specific page citations and concise summaries of events strengthens your analysis.

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - The essay does an excellent job juxtaposing Cass and Isaac, not just reciting plot points but critically examining their different responses to their shared legacy.

4. **Nuanced Understanding**
   - You acknowledge the complexities of the characters’ relationships to the land, to each other, and to their family’s history of slavery and incest.
   - The discussion of intergenerational trauma and the idea of a “curse” demonstrates maturity of interpretation.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Thesis Development & Clarity**
   - The thesis is clear, but you could state it more strongly and precisely in your introduction. As written, the first paragraph is a bit circuitous. Consider tightening the opening lines to foreground your perspective immediately.

2. **Organization**
   - The flow of ideas is sometimes disrupted by back-and-forth references (e.g., moving from Cass to Isaac, then back again). Try more explicit topic sentences and transitions to clarify when you shift focus.
   - Summaries of events (e.g., Cass’s upbringing) sometimes feel long. Prioritize analysis over summary, especially as your reader likely knows the text.

3. **Thematic Complexity**
   - There are opportunities to more closely analyze *why* Cass and Isaac react differently, beyond just age/generation. For example, can you connect their choices to Faulkner’s broader themes of Southern history, race, and redemption?
   - How does Sam Fathers influence both characters differently? You mention him but might dig a little deeper into his symbolic role.

4. **Conclusion**
   - The conclusion is solid but could be more robust. Instead of merely restating, try to briefly consider implications: what does this suggest about the possibility of overcoming inherited “curses” in the American South, or in families generally?

## Writing Style & Mechanics

### Strengths

- **Academic Tone:** The writing is formal and well-suited for literary analysis.
- **Quotation Integration:** You blend quotations smoothly into your own analysis.
- **Clarity:** For the most part, your points are clear and logically sequenced.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Wordiness & Conciseness**
   - Some sentences are overly complex or wordy. Look for ways to break up long sentences for readability.
   - Example: “Cass’s experience bears great resemblance to Isaac’s experience on the face of it, but Cass is not nearly as affected by the bear or seeing the mystical buck as is Isaac.” → “While Cass’s experience mirrors Isaac’s, he is not as affected by the bear or the mystical buck.”

2. **Paragraphing**
   - A few paragraphs are quite long and could be split to emphasize key points or shifts in argument.

3. **Transitions & Topic Sentences**
   - Be sure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence tying it to your thesis, and use stronger transitions to guide the reader through your comparisons.

## Minor Issues

- **Citation:** Be consistent in using parenthetical citations after quotations.
- **Names:** Sometimes you switch between “Cass” and “McCaslin” without explaining for new readers that both refer to the same character (McCaslin Edmonds). Clarify early on.

## Overall Assessment

This is a thoughtful, well-supported, and perceptive paper that demonstrates a good grasp of Faulkner’s themes and artistry. With tighter organization, slightly more focused analysis, and some stylistic polish, it could be an excellent upper-level undergraduate essay.

**Suggested next steps:**
- Clarify and strengthen your thesis in the introduction.
- Organize your paragraphs for smoother transitions between points.
- Dig a little deeper into the “why” of the characters’ differences in response to inherited trauma.
- Streamline some sentences for clarity and conciseness.

**Overall grade (if you’re curious):** Likely in the B+/A- range as written, with room for A/A+ with further refinement.
