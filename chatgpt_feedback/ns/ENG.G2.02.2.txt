Certainly! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, **“City Troubles”: Miss Lonelyhearts and the Publicized Privacy of Urban Space**. The feedback will consider thesis clarity, argumentation, evidence, structure, scholarly engagement, written style, and potential improvements.

---

### **Strengths**

#### **1. Strong, Engaged Introduction**
- Your introduction establishes the central critical debates around *Miss Lonelyhearts*—specifically, the work’s ambivalence regarding suffering, sincerity, and irony.
- The use of West’s poem "Burn the Cities" is a compelling opening, setting the thematic tone and linking the novel to broader questions of urban modernity.

#### **2. Clear and Compelling Thesis**
- You articulate a precise and thoughtful thesis: the novel’s central tension between public and private expressions of suffering, and how this is mediated through urban and textual spaces.
- You’re explicit about moving the conversation beyond sincerity/irony dichotomies to the interaction between physical (urban) and discursive (newspaper/letters) spaces.

#### **3. Excellent Use of Secondary Sources**
- The essay demonstrates deep engagement with criticism (Berman, Fiedler, Veitch, Greenberg, etc.), with clear attributions and a nuanced synthesis of differing viewpoints.
- Your use of Veitch, especially, is productive in opening up the question of mediation and the function of the advice column.

#### **4. Close Reading of the Text**
- You consistently root your analysis in detailed, textual evidence—both from the letters in the novel and from scenes involving Miss Lonelyhearts’ relationships with other characters (e.g., the Doyles, Betty).
- The reading of Broad Shoulders’ letter, and the analysis of the intersection of public and private, are especially strong.

#### **5. Theoretical Ambition**
- The engagement with Marshall Berman and modernist theory elevates the paper, showing keen interest in the historical and social context of modernism.

#### **6. Logical Progression**
- The paper is well-organized. Each section builds on the previous one, leading to a satisfying and thematically rich conclusion linking back to *Burn the Cities*.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### **1. Thesis Reiteration and Focus**
- While your thesis is strong, it could be stated more succinctly at the paper’s outset (before the first block quote or at the end of the first paragraph) and then reiterated later for emphasis. This would keep your reader continuously oriented.

#### **2. Organizational Signposting**
- Though generally well-structured, the essay sometimes moves rapidly between critics, theory, and textual analysis. Brief roadmap sentences (“In the next section, I will…”) could help guide the reader.
- Consider paragraph topic sentences that clarify what each paragraph will contribute to your argument.

#### **3. Synthesis Over Summary**
- Occasionally, you summarize secondary sources at length (e.g., the discussion of Bremer and Veitch) before linking them to your own claim. Tighten these segments to foreground your own argument—use critics as supports, not as detours.

#### **4. Engagement With Counterarguments**
- You might consider engaging more explicitly with possible objections or alternative readings. For example, might someone argue that the novel/column *does* make possible a form of sincere consolation, or does offer a viable community? Addressing these possibilities would strengthen your claims.

#### **5. Style and Clarity**
- The style is generally elevated, but sentences are sometimes long and complex; a few become unwieldy. Vary sentence length for readability.
- Paraphrasing or breaking up quotes for clarity would help—especially with complex passages from the letters.

#### **6. The Ending**
- The conclusion is strong in relating West’s poem to the novel, but a final sentence drawing out the stakes of your argument for broader literary or cultural questions (i.e., *why* this matters for modernist studies or for our understanding of public/private experience today) could be powerful.

### **Minor Points / Edits**

- **Typos/Formatting**: Occasional awkward grammar, sometimes missing commas after introductory clauses.
