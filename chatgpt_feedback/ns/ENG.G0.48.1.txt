Certainly! Here is a thorough feedback and critique for your paper, focusing on your **argument, organization, use of evidence, style, and overall effectiveness**:

---

### 1. Thesis & Argument

**Strengths:**
- Your main argument—a comparative study of Yezierska’s and Dos Passos’s narrative forms via rewriting—is clearly articulated and creative.
- The paper promises and delivers not just analysis but actual creative engagement (rewriting passages), which is unique and intellectually rigorous.
- You succeed in showing that *form* and *content* are deeply intertwined, and that rewriting can illuminate this relationship.

**Areas to Improve:**
- While your thesis is strong, it could be condensed for clarity. The intro could more sharply state not just what you’re doing ("probing the space...") but what you aim to *prove*: That the meaning of a work is inseparable from its form, as shown through your rewritings.

### 2. Organization & Structure

**Strengths:**
- The paper is logically organized: you introduce the two authors/texts, proceed with your rewritings, and follow each with reflections/analytical commentary.
- It is easy to follow your process, and the summary paragraphs after each creative section are insightful.

**Areas to Improve:**
- Some paragraphs are quite long and could be broken up for easier reading. For instance, the section after your first Yezierska-style rewrite can be divided into two or three smaller paragraphs.
- Transitions could be improved; sometimes sections end abruptly and the next begins without enough connective tissue.

### 3. Use of Evidence

**Strengths:**
- You quote both Yezierska and Dos Passos and reference their plots/actions in detail.
- Inclusion of your own creative rewritings is imaginative, pertinent, and serves as primary evidence for your claims.

**Areas to Improve:**
- At times, you reference plot or theme in general terms (e.g., "Daughter tells Dick..."), but you could anchor commentary more frequently with short quotations or page numbers for clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the texts.
- Tie your close-readings more directly to your thesis—sometimes the insights about the characters or tone could circle back more forcefully to your claims about form/content.

### 4. Style, Language & Mechanics

**Strengths:**
- The prose is generally clear, reflective, and engaging. Your voice is confident and intellectually curious.
- You successfully imitate the styles of both authors, showing strong command of narrative voice.

**Areas to Improve:**
- Watch out for occasional grammar, wordiness, or awkward phrasing. For instance:  
  - *"it was as if he were God sent to speak endless tongues..."* is ambitious but a bit unclear.
  - Consider “psychological movement” vs “plot movement” distinctions—could be explained with a bit more clarity for readers not versed in narratology.
- Be careful with register; the informal ending ("It’s 3:38 in the morning and I’ve sincerely had fun.") might not be appropriate unless your instructor has encouraged such a tone.

### 5. Analytical Depth & Insight

**Strengths:**
- Your observations about the effect of narration (internal/external, emotional/objective) are strong and well-illustrated by your rewritings.
- Good recognition of modernist themes (idealism/disillusionment, agency, etc.) in both authors, even as their styles diverge.

**Areas to Improve:**
- You could push your comparative insights even further. For example, what does *the failure to translate character depth* from one style to another tell us about modernism as a movement, or about immigrant experience vs. American alienation?
- Occasionally, sentences are a bit tentative ("It made the most sense to me to end Daughter’s story optimistically..."), but a more assertive voice would be appropriate: "Yezierska's style demanded a hopeful ending, revealing how form shapes narrative possibility."

### 6. Conclusion

**Strengths:**
- The conclusion is honest and reflective, and it circles back to your main themes well.

**Areas to Improve:**
- Your final paragraph could better synthesize your findings—what is the broader implication for literary study or pedagogy? How might your experiment inform how we read or teach modernist literature?

---

## **Summary of Strengths**
- Inventive and original approach to comparing two modernist authors.
- Effective demonstration of how style influences narrative content.
- Strong close-reading and creative writing skills.
- Thoughtful, reflective analysis.

## **Summary of Suggestions**
- Sharpen thesis and topic sentences.
- Break up long paragraphs and improve transitions.
- Integrate more textual evidence as you analyze.
- Clarify and assert your insights more forcefully.
- Finish with a broader, more synthetic conclusion.

---

**Overall:**  
This paper is original, insightful, and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of literary form. With some tightening of argument and language, and a bit more assertiveness in your critical voice, it would be an excellent undergraduate essay. Well done!
