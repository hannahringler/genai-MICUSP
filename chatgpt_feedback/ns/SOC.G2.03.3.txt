Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, considering aspects such as clarity, organization, engagement with theory, critical thinking, and writing style.

---

**1. Organization and Structure**
- *Strengths:* Your essay clearly addresses the assigned question, with a logical structure that first outlines your classification scheme, then discusses each theorist in detail (Alexander, Durkheim, Bourdieu), and explores both similarities and differences.
- *Suggestions:* Consider using more explicit subheadings or topic sentences at the beginning of each section to further guide the reader. For instance, "Alexander’s Theory of Civil Society," "Durkheim and the Sacred/Profane," etc.

**2. Understanding of Theorists**
- *Strengths:* You exhibit strong command of the materials—your explanations of Saussure, Durkheim, Alexander, Bourdieu, and Foucault are accurate and demonstrate in-depth engagement. You don’t just summarize their ideas but apply them contextually.
- *Suggestions:* While you provide critical questions (e.g., about Alexander’s lack of practical solutions), occasionally push further by offering brief alternatives or more concretely linking their theories to contemporary examples.

**3. Synthesis and Comparative Analysis**
- *Strengths:* The paper does a nice job grouping theorists by their approach to symbols, language, and power, and it traces out clear lines of comparison between how theorists view social structure, culture, and inequality.
- *Suggestions:* The comparative sections could be made more explicit—perhaps a paragraph that directly contrasts, say, Durkheim and Bourdieu on the role of cohesion and differentiation within society, rather than relying on in-passing comments.

**4. Critical Reflection**
- *Strengths:* You thoughtfully question Durkheim’s optimism, Alexander’s solutions, and potential critiques of Bourdieu, which is excellent.
- *Suggestions:* Where you raise questions (“Does the economy break up social cohesion for Durkheim? Does Alexander endorse welfare?”), try to venture some possible answers based on your reading, even if speculative, to show initiative in theoretical engagement.

**5. Use of Examples**
- *Strengths:* Good use of real-world examples (e.g., George Orwell’s 1984, social welfare programs, "Work First" classes) to illustrate theoretical points.
- *Suggestions:* Sometimes examples could be integrated more tightly with the argument. For instance, after mentioning "Work First," reflect on how Bourdieu would analyze such a program: does it confirm or challenge his thesis about cultural capital?

**6. Writing Style and Mechanics**
- *Strengths:* Your writing is clear, concise, and largely free of grammatical errors. Terms are well defined for the reader, such as “habitus.”
- *Suggestions:* Occasionally sentences are quite long—consider breaking up long passages for easier readability. Also, ensure direct quotes are tightly integrated and always reflect on their significance.

**7. Use of Citations**
- Very thorough use of primary sources and good engagement with secondary literature.

**Summary of Strengths**
- Deep engagement with theory
- Thoughtful classification and comparative analysis
- Good critical thinking and use of real-world examples
- Clear, scholarly writing

**Areas to Strengthen**
- Build out and organize sections with subheadings
- Use more explicit, direct comparison/contrast paragraphs
- Where you raise questions, try to answer or further elaborate
- Split up long sentences for clarity

**Possible Grade:** Assuming this is for a graduate-level theory class, this is a high-quality paper—likely in the A range, with room for minor refinements to reach even greater clarity and depth.

**Additional Thought:**  
If you had space, you could deepen the contemporary relevance section. For example, tie Bourdieu to current debates about social mobility, or show how Alexander’s codes of “us” vs “them” shape debates over immigration, etc.

**Overall:**  
Excellent, critically engaged paper, showing strong understanding of difficult theorists and thoughtful analysis of their differences and implications for understanding society.
