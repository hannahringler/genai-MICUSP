Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, highlighting strengths and suggesting areas for improvement:

**Overall Feedback**

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Structure & Organization:**  
   The essay is organized logically: it introduces the real-life scenario, presents the relevant theory (collective action problems, or CAPs), analyzes the scenario under different conditions, and ties this analysis back to theoretical models and class simulations (e.g., GACC, Schelling). Each section flows into the next with purpose.

2. **Effective Use of Real-World Example:**  
   Using the house dishwashing dilemma gives your analysis relatability and concreteness. It makes abstract concepts like collective action, peer pressure, and enforceability immediately intelligible.

3. **Demonstrates Theoretical Understanding:**  
   The paper shows a good grasp of CAPs and the nuances of actor behavior (differences in knowledge, cost functions, peer pressure). You also effectively relate this example to concepts from Schelling and the class GACC simulation.

4. **Critical Thinking:**  
   You don't merely describe the situation but probe into why total defection is impossible, why peer pressure varies seasonally, and why efficiency-maximizing solutions may be unworkable. This shows analytical depth.

5. **Visual Aids:**  
   The mention of Figures 1 and 2 strengthens your argument, showing awareness that conceptual arguments can be supported by visual models.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Figures/Graphs Integration:**  
   The references to Figures 1 and 2 are helpful, but since only the captions are included (or the graphs are not visible here), readers may find it harder to engage. In a formal paper or presentation, you should ensure that figures/graphs are included and clearly labeled, with all points (A-F) explained in the text.

2. **Citations & Engagement with Sources:**  
   While you mention Schelling and the class simulation, a more explicit citation style (e.g., using footnotes, page numbers, or author-date in parentheses) would make your analysis more professional and easier for readers to verify. If this is for an academic course, check required citation guidelines.

3. **Depth of Policy Implications:**  
   You mention that a "formal system" might be more effective, particularly in summer. To strengthen the essay, briefly sketch what such a policy could look like, possible challenges, and whether it might create new problems (e.g., resentment, policing difficulties).

4. **Clarity and Conciseness:**  
   Some sentences are long and could be streamlined for clarity (for example: "To define the system, the binary choice occurs after a resident has used dishes..." could be simplified). Watch for occasional wordiness.

5. **Engage the Reader in the Conclusion:**  
   The essay ends a bit abruptly. A succinct concluding paragraph tying back to the opening and offering a final insight or recommendation (even if tentative) can help leave a stronger impression.

6. **Formatting and Minor Errors:**  
   Double-check the formatting (e.g., line breaks, spacing) to ensure a clean submission. There are a few minor grammatical issues (e.g., "there are is one equilibrium" should be "there is one equilibrium").

**Summative Comments:**

This is a thoughtful, well-developed analysis that successfully links real-life group dynamics with theoretical models from class. With minor refinement—cleaner citations, a stronger conclusion, and more explicit figures—this paper would be very strong. Consider adding a sentence or two explicitly reflecting on how this micro-level analysis relates to larger, global environmental policy CAPs, to tie back to your course theme.

**Score (if required):**  
If assessing out of 10 for a graduate-level paper: **8.5–9/10**
