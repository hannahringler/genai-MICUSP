Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on the paper, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement:

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Summary of Descartes’s Argument**
- The paper demonstrates a *solid understanding* of Descartes’s argument about clear and distinct ideas, and effectively outlines the infamous "Cartesian Circle."
- The summary of *premises and logical structure* (first, second, and third premises) is handled methodically. This shows a clear grasp of the logical steps Descartes attempts.
- You correctly emphasize the importance of the passage in providing a working definition for “clear and distinct perception,” which is often left ambiguous.

### 2. **Contextualization**
- The paper nicely connects the excerpt to the broader aims of the *Meditations*, explaining why this explanation is pivotal for Descartes's overall project.

### 3. **Critical Awareness**
- There’s a brief—and accurate—recognition of the “Cartesian Circle” as a problem, and an acknowledgment that these arguments are controversial (“as we have already established in class, the argument is flawed…”).

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Depth of Analysis/Critique**
- While you mention that the argument is flawed, you don’t *explain in detail* why. The “Cartesian Circle” is only lightly touched upon. 
    - *Suggestion:* Elaborate on what the Cartesian Circle is (i.e., Descartes’ alleged circular reasoning in using God’s existence to guarantee clear and distinct perceptions when he also needs clear and distinct perceptions to prove God’s existence). Reference a standard objection directly.
    - *Suggestion:* Explore alternative interpretations or possible responses for Descartes, e.g., some scholars argue that the “Circle” is not vicious, or that Descartes distinguishes between “actual” and “memorial” clear and distinct perceptions.

### 2. **Engagement with Textual Evidence**
- There are very few direct quotations or references to Descartes’ precise wording (other than the one brief citation about the definition).
    - *Suggestion:* Add more direct textual support. Refer to specific parts of the Meditations and use short quotations to back up your interpretation.

### 3. **Organization and Flow**
- The organization is generally clear, but at times transitions could be smoother. Some sentences are slightly repetitive or wordy (e.g., “he does not go into much detail about this argument, because it is very much an obvious point…” can be tightened).
    - *Suggestion:* Use clear topic sentences for each paragraph. Summarize your analysis at the end of each major section.

### 4. **Originality and Engagement**
- Most of the writing is summary and restatement, with relatively little of your own critical voice or unique perspective.
    - *Suggestion:* After outlining Descartes’s argument, spend at least one full paragraph presenting your own perspective. Do you find Descartes’s logic persuasive? Why or why not? How might one defend Descartes, or what is most problematic?

### 5. **Technical Details**
- The paper cites only the main text but doesn’t refer to other scholarship, and the “Works Cited” only includes Descartes. That’s acceptable for some undergrad assignments but consider engaging with at least one secondary source (such as an article or commentary on the Meditations) to show wider reading.
- There are some small grammatical issues (e.g., “one cannot argue that he did not put any thought into it” is awkward; perhaps try “it is clear that Descartes devoted significant thought to this problem, even if his solution is unsatisfying”).

## Sample Revision of a Section

#### Before
> As we discussed in class, Descartes never completely explains why he is not creating what has been referred to as the “Cartesian Circle.” But this did not stop him from advocating it as a way for us to definitively know that God exists.

#### After
> As we discussed in class, many philosophers claim Descartes’ argument commits the so-called “Cartesian Circle,” because he needs the truth of clear and distinct perceptions to prove God, but also needs God to guarantee the truth of clear and distinct perceptions. Descartes attempts to respond to this objection, but many critics find his solution unconvincing.

## Overall Assessment

- **Score (if required):** B/B+
- **Summary:** The paper demonstrates a good grasp of the philosophical material and follows the argument closely, but could be improved by deeper critical engagement, tighter prose, and richer textual support. Try to move beyond summary to critique and independent analysis.
