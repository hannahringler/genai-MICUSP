Absolutely! This is a polished and insightful undergraduate essay that thoughtfully analyzes Margery Kempe’s self-fashioning via her reported religious visions. Below is detailed feedback addressing strengths and areas for improvement, organized into several categories for clarity:

---

**Strengths**

1. **Strong Thesis and Focus**
   - The argument that Margery’s apparent passivity is a strategic self-fashioning—used both to claim authority and gain psychological benefits—is clearly established and referenced throughout the paper.

2. **Engagement with Primary and Secondary Sources**
   - You support your analysis with quotes from *The Book of Margery Kempe*, providing close readings and drawing out implications.
   - Effective use of secondary sources: Brundage and Noonan contextualize her experience within late medieval attitudes toward women, marriage, and sexuality.

3. **Nuanced Analysis**
   - The paper recognizes complexity, acknowledging (and setting aside) debates about Margery’s motives, while focusing on the rhetorical effects and results of her self-fashioning.
   - You explore both the external (public/authoritative) and internal (emotional/psychological) functions of Margery’s visions.

4. **Structure and Organization**
   - The essay progresses logically; each section builds on the last, moving from the construction of passivity, to manipulation of narrative and reader, to interpersonal and psychological benefits for Margery herself.

5. **Attention to Literary Technique**
   - Noting Margery’s third-person narration and self-references as “the creature” is a sophisticated observation about voice and self-distancing in spiritual autobiography.

**Areas for Improvement/Suggestions**

1. **Signposting and Transitions**
   - While generally clear, some paragraphs are quite long and could use more explicit topic sentences or transitions, guiding the reader from one sub-argument to the next. For example, when shifting from the analysis of obedience to textual manipulation, signal this move more explicitly.

2. **Thesis Placement and Precision**
   - The thesis does appear in the introduction, but could be more assertively stated—perhaps as the final sentence of the opening paragraph, for added emphasis and clarity.
   - Example revision: “Margery’s self-recitation of her visions is not simply an expression of humility, but a strategic self-fashioning that grants her authority over her life, her audience, and even her own psyche.”

3. **Engagement with Counterarguments**
   - You note that some might view Margery’s visions as “fundamental dishonesty,” and you distance yourself from making assumptions about her motives. However, briefly referencing alternative scholarly perspectives (e.g., on authenticity vs. performance in female medieval mysticism) could further strengthen your analysis.
   - Are there limits to self-fashioning in her case? You might address whether Margery’s strategy ever backfires, or if audiences outside her circle (other church officials, readers, etc.) remained unconvinced.

4. **Use of Footnotes**
   - Your use of footnotes is fine, but since this is an undergraduate seminar paper, sometimes integrating this material into the main text is preferable for flow—unless these are endnotes required by the assignment style.

5. **Close Reading**
   - You might occasionally dig even deeper into individual passages from the primary text, analyzing language and imagery (especially as it relates to mystical union/marriage). This would showcase your skills in textual analysis.

6. **Conclusion**
   - The paper could end with a more forceful conclusion that broadens the implications of your argument—what does Margery’s case tell us about women’s agency in the Middle Ages, about autobiography as a genre, or about religious experience and gender more broadly?

---

**Minor Editing/Style Points**
- A few sentences are very long or complex; breaking these up for ease of reading can help.
- Double-check in-text citations for consistency (e.g., italicizing book titles, page numbers).
- “Immaculate Conception” is actually a doctrine about Mary’s conception without sin, not the Virgin Birth. Consider revising that language.

**Overall Assessment**

This essay is impressively researched, well-argued, and sophisticated in its treatment of Margery Kempe’s strategies of self-fashioning. With a little more attention to signposting, tighter argumentation, and a bolder conclusion, it would be an excellent undergraduate humanities essay and could even serve as a strong model for close reading and gender studies analysis.

If you’re working on a revision or aiming for publication/presentation, consider incorporating or responding to a broader range of scholarship on women mystics or exploring the reception of Margery’s text in later centuries.

**Grade Equivalent:** A- to A
