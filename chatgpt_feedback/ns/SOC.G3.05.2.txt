Absolutely! Below, I’ll give you **in-depth feedback** on the paper, “Drunk Girls are Easy: Binge-Drinking College Women’s Engagement with the ‘Slutty’ Discourse and its Implications for Sexual Violence.” I’ll cover **strengths, areas for improvement, and some specific suggestions.** (If you want feedback focused on only one aspect—like structure or argument—let me know!)

## Overall Strengths

### 1. **Timely and Important Topic**
   - This paper addresses a highly relevant and complex issue: the intersection of college partying, gender, and sexual violence. It is a significant contribution given ongoing concerns about campus safety, consent, and gendered social expectations.

### 2. **Strong Qualitative Methodology**
   - The use of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 31 self-identified binge-drinking undergraduate women is well-suited for examining nuanced social discourses and lived experiences.
   - The reflexive methodology is evident; the researcher is transparent about their role, positionality, and the iterative nature of coding/interviewing. This increases the trustworthiness of the results.

### 3. **Clear Organization and Flow**
   - The paper is logically structured: Abstract, Introduction, Background/Literature Review, Data/Methods, Findings (Party Culture, The Slutty Discourse, Safety), and Conclusion/Implications.
   - Headings and transitions are clear, making the argument easy to follow.

### 4. **Thoughtful Engagement with Literature**
   - The background section demonstrates a strong grasp of key literature on campus violence, rape culture, party subcultures, and gender studies.
   - The author skillfully situates their work within (and extends) the work of others (e.g., Armstrong, Martin & Hummer, MacKinnon).

### 5. **Rich, Nuanced Analysis**
   - The use of direct quotes and detailed examples from interviewees makes the findings compelling and authentic.
   - The author highlights contradictions (e.g., women “othering” each other, the coexistence of pleasure and risk) and wrestles intelligently with concepts like “sluttiness,” vulnerability, and safety.

### 6. **Powerful Implications Section**
   - The paper ends with clear, actionable recommendations both for feminist theory and anti-sexual-violence practice, indicating relevance beyond academia.

## Areas for Improvement or Further Development

### 1. **Theoretical Depth/Conceptual Clarity**
   - The concept of "sluttiness" could be more deeply theorized. While its operationalization as DRINKING + SEXINESS is interesting, engaging with broader feminist/queer sexualities literature may enrich the analysis (e.g., Judith Butler on performativity, or newer work on slut-shaming and postfeminist media culture).
   - The “party culture is sexualized” claim is well supported, but a more intersectional approach (beyond some racial/ethnic and class differences) could clarify how “sluttiness” operates differently across identity categories.

### 2. **Sample Limitations**
   - The author acknowledges homogeneity (participants were all heterosexual, mostly upper-middle class, and few sorority members). This is good, but the limitations could be discussed more in the implications: How might bisexual/queer women, non-cisgender people, or students at less elite schools experience these dynamics differently?

### 3. **Victim-Blaming—More Critical Distance?**
   - The paper thoughtfully unpacks how “othering” and safety practices reinforce stigmatization of “slutty”/vulnerable women. However, the author could offer more critique of the university and broader rape culture (e.g., how institutional policies reinforce these patterns) rather than placing so much emphasis on women’s internalized attitudes.
   - What about men’s roles? The “guys on the prowl” discourse is mentioned, but the gendered dynamics of power and entitlement could use deeper analysis.

### 4. **Writing/Editing**
   - The prose is largely clear and engaging, but the length could be tightened in places to avoid some repetition (e.g., the rules of safe partying, or reiterating points about “slutty as code for rape-able”).
   - Occasional minor grammar issues (e.g., typo: “loosing” instead of “losing”)—simple proofreading should fix.

### 5. **Implications—Could Go Further**
   - The suggestions for future theory/practice are strong, but the paper could offer more on how to actually support young women in resisting both slut-shaming and rape culture, or how universities could foster environments that disrupt these discourses (e.g., bystander training, consent education, less punitive alcohol policies).

## Specific Suggestions

- **Clarify Definitions Up Front:** Early on, spell out how “party culture,” “slutty,” and “sexual assault/violence” are used—offer working definitions before diving into literature review.
- **Engage More Directly with Intersectionality:** Discuss how race/class/sorority status/queerness affect one’s ability to “pass” or be “othered” as slutty and vulnerable.
- **Tie Back to Policy:** How can these findings inform university alcohol/sexual misconduct policies? Can student support services be redesigned?
- **More Men’s Voices/Structures:** Briefly address what parallel discourses or institutional pressures exist for men—are men ever “othered” (as creeps, predators, or similar)?
- **Visuals/Appendices (optional):** Consider including sample interview questions or a table of main themes in an appendix, if allowed.

## Final Evaluation

This is a **thoughtful, well-executed paper** that makes a meaningful contribution to understanding campus sexual culture and the lived experiences of women negotiating risk and stigma. The analysis is intelligent, the evidence compelling, and the implications significant.

**With deeper theorization of “sluttiness,” more intersectional analysis, and perhaps an expanded discussion of institutional structures and men’s roles, this could be a publishable paper—or, at minimum, an excellent model for qualitative research at the graduate level.**

**Grade (if appropriate):** High A/A-, with revision suggestions as above.
