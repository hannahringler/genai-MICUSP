Absolutely! Here is a constructive and detailed feedback for your essay, **"The Inclusion of Friday in Robinson Crusoe: An Exertion of European Dominance."**

---

## Strengths

**1. Strong Thesis and Clear Argument:**  
Your thesis is clear and consistently addressed throughout. You argue persuasively that the character Friday is used to reflect and facilitate Crusoe’s (and by extension, European) dominance, linking this to colonial attitudes and slavery. This is a sophisticated approach.

**2. Effective Use of Evidence:**  
You support your points with appropriate and well-chosen textual evidence from *Robinson Crusoe*, including well-integrated quotations. The use of criticism from Ian Watt and James Joyce adds depth and external perspective to your argument.

**3. Analytical Depth:**  
You move beyond surface level analysis and examine how Crusoe’s attitudes and actions symbolize wider European colonial attitudes. Your discussion of commodification, ownership, and paternalism is nuanced.

**4. Organization:**  
The essay is logically organized, tracking Crusoe’s early experiences with slavery, his relationship with Xury, and then his eventual relationship with Friday. Each paragraph builds on the last for a coherent whole.

**5. Attention to Historical Context:**  
You effectively situate the novel in its historical context and show awareness of how contemporary views inform both Defoe’s writing and our reading.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Thesis Nuance and Focus:**  
While your thesis is strong, it could be sharpened further with a more explicit acknowledgment of the novel's possible ambiguity toward slavery. At times, you skirt the possibility that Defoe is critiquing as well as reproducing colonial attitudes—engaging with this tension would strengthen your analysis.

**2. Connection to Defoe Himself:**  
You sometimes conflate Crusoe’s views with Defoe’s without qualification (e.g., “whether...Daniel Defoe himself supported the use of slavery...” ). It might be useful to clarify that you are analyzing Defoe’s text, characters, and context rather than Defoe’s personal views, unless you have biographical evidence.

**3. Engagement with Contradictions:**  
You note that Crusoe treats Friday with “a level of respect” and even love, but quickly dismiss this as insufficient. Consider engaging more with why Defoe chooses to portray this modicum of respect. Is it to make Crusoe sympathetic? To complicate a simple binary of good/evil masters? Addressing these contradictions in more depth will paint a more complex picture.

**4. Close Reading:**  
While you include many quotations, some could be analyzed more deeply. For example, Crusoe’s language of possession (“my cave,” “my subjects”) could be broken down even further to show how language itself enacts domination.

**5. Conclusion Expansion:**  
Your conclusion restates your thesis well but could be stronger by considering the implications of your analysis today—e.g., does *Robinson Crusoe* still shape modern attitudes? Do these colonial narratives persist?

**6. Minor Stylistic Suggestions:**  
- The essay could be more concise in places; some points are repeated (e.g., Crusoe’s commodification of people).
- Make sure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence.
- Watch for occasional wordiness or redundancy (“imperative historical topic that reaches a wide audience,” can be trimmed).

## Sample Revised Thesis (just as an example for further clarity):

> “The inclusion of Friday in Daniel Defoe’s *Robinson Crusoe* not only enables Crusoe to exert dominance over a person rather than merely a territory, but also serves as a literary vehicle for exploring—and ultimately justifying—the imperial and racial hierarchies underpinning European colonial expansion; yet, Defoe’s nuanced portrayal of Crusoe’s conflicting feelings gestures toward a more ambivalent attitude toward slavery and colonialism than a surface reading might suggest.”

## Overall Assessment

This is a strong, well-evidenced, and insightful undergraduate essay that engages skillfully with both the text of *Robinson Crusoe* and its wider implications. With more attention to nuance, contradiction, and the potential for Defoe’s critique as well as reproduction of colonial attitudes, this could be an excellent literature analysis!
