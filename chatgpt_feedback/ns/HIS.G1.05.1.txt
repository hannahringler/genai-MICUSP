## Big Picture Feedback

### Strengths

**1. Depth of Analysis:**  
You successfully situate Natalie Zemon Davis’s project in its historiographical and methodological context. Your engagement with Davis’s careful balancing of speculation and evidence shows a sophisticated understanding of her goals and challenges.

**2. Effective Use of Evidence:**  
Your citations are precise, and you draw explicitly from both primary (al-Wazzan’s works) and secondary (Davis and Cohen) sources to support your analysis.

**3. Clarity and Organization:**  
The essay is clearly organized, with a logical structure. You move from the summary of Davis’s subject and method, through close analysis of her argument and technique, to a thoughtful discussion of the broader implications.

**4. Reflection and Critique:**  
You don’t just summarize Davis’s work, but critically reflect on her choices and point out both her strengths and possible limitations (e.g. the degree of speculation, and her focus on an atypical figure).

**5. Contextualization:**  
Bringing in Mark Cohen’s comparative work is an excellent way to frame Davis’s contributions and broader relevance.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Thesis Statement and Argument:**  
While your analysis is thorough, the central thesis could be stated more succinctly upfront. What, specifically, are you arguing about Davis’s approach or her book’s significance? You hint at several possibilities (her balance of evidence and imagination, her model of cross-cultural exchange), but a clearer thesis statement in your introduction would give the essay even greater focus.

**2. Synthesis vs. Summary:**  
There are places where you veer into detailed summary (including lengthy recounting of al-Wazzan’s biography or Davis’s reconstruction techniques). Consider condensing some of this material in favor of more space devoted to *your* evaluation.

**3. Engagement with Limitations:**  
Although you mention that Davis’s reliance on speculation is handled transparently, you might push your critique a little further. For example: Are there dangers in Davis’s narrative method? Could her imaginative reconstructions inadvertently shape how future scholars remember the past?

**4. Style and Redundancy:**  
The prose is generally strong, but there are some repetitive phrases (e.g. reiteration of Davis’s speculation and transparency). Some sentences could be tightened for concision and clarity.

**5. Conclusion:**  
The closing paragraphs give a good sense of “so what?” but could more explicitly tie back to your thesis and offer an evaluative judgment. Did Davis ultimately succeed? Should historians follow her example? Why?

## Specific Suggestions

**Introduction:**
- Open with a sentence that captures Davis’s approach and your main evaluative point.
- State your thesis clearly: "Davis's work exemplifies both the possibilities and limits of imaginative historical reconstruction, using al-Wazzan/al-Asad to demonstrate the permeability of cultural boundaries—yet raises important questions about the line between evidence and speculation."

**Body Paragraphs:**
- When summarizing Davis’s arguments, pause to analyze: Why does her method matter? What does it reveal or obscure?
- When discussing al-Wazzan’s “double vision,” more directly address how this supports (or complicates) Davis’s larger arguments about identity and cross-cultural curiosity.

**Conclusion:**
- Avoid simply restating your summary. Instead, articulate your own position: Does Davis’s approach offer a necessary corrective to strict empiricism? Or does it risk romanticizing the past?
- Consider the implications for the discipline: What does Davis’s method suggest about the future of writing cultural or “micro” history?

## Minor Points

- Double-check all formatting, especially footnotes, to maintain academic consistency if submitting for class or publication.
- Check transitions—some paragraphs are dense and could benefit from clearer topic sentences or signposting.
- Consider adding a brief sentence or two on intended audience—how does Davis’s writing speak to both scholars and the general public, in your view?

## Overall Evaluation

This is a **well-researched, thoughtful, and clearly presented** paper that demonstrates advanced engagement with both Davis’s book and wider historiographical issues. With some tightening of thesis and conclusions, and greater emphasis on your own analytic voice, it could be even stronger.

**Grade Estimate:** A- to A (depending on instructor’s emphasis on thesis clarity and original critique).
