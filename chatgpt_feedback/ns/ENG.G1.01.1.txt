Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, **“Clarissa Consumed”**. I’ll address **structure, argumentation, use of evidence, historical/contextual awareness, style, originality, and areas for revision or further development**.

---

### Strengths

#### 1. **Thesis and Argumentation**
- **Clear Focus:** Your thesis is clear and original: you argue that Clarissa should be analyzed as an *embodied*, physical being rooted in her eighteenth-century medical context, particularly through the lens of nervous consumption, rather than only as an allegorical or symbolic figure.
- **Critical Engagement:** You engage with prior scholarship (e.g., Frega, Eagleton, Castle) thoughtfully, positioning your argument as both a critique and an expansion of the “anorexia” reading.
- **Nuanced Analysis:** By drawing in Richard Morton and George Cheyne, you not only contextualize Clarissa’s illness in the medical discourses of her time, but demonstrate how this context can alter prevailing interpretations about her decline.

#### 2. **Use of Evidence**
- **Textual Evidence:** You cite the novel closely and perceptively, drawing attention to the minutiae of Clarissa’s body and habits that are often overlooked.
- **Historical Context:** Bringing in Morton and Cheyne, and explicating eighteenth-century views on constitution, nerves, and “consumption,” gives your reading depth and historicity.
- **Balanced Analysis:** You’re careful about ambiguities (i.e., possibility of pregnancy vs. nervous consumption; the limits of contemporary diagnosis).

#### 3. **Structure and Organization**
- **Logical Flow:** The paper flows logically from a critique of modern readings to historical/medical context, then to close readings of Clarissa, Lovelace, and the implications of “constitution.”
- **Subsections:** Breaking the paper into clearly labeled sections helps guide the reader and underscores the methodical nature of your approach.

#### 4. **Style and Clarity**
- **Academic Tone:** Your prose is clear, disciplined, and (for the most part) concise, with a good balance between paraphrase and direct quotation.
- **Mature Writing:** Especially strong is your ability to connect high-level concepts (spiritual discipline, societal ideals, medical models) to the granular details of the text.

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Engagement with Counterarguments**
- **Explicit Address:** While you reference other readings (martyrdom, suicide, self-expulsion), you mostly address them in footnotes or passing. Consider developing (perhaps in the introduction or a brief “limitations” paragraph) a more explicit engagement with why your embodied reading is superior or complementary to these.
- **Potential Critiques:** Some might argue that the medical-historical reading “flattens” Clarissa as much as the psychoanalytic ones do. Anticipating and responding to this concern would strengthen your position.

#### 2. **Balance Between Sources and Original Analysis**
- **Dependence on Frega:** At times, your engagement with Frega becomes lengthy; you might shorten your summary of her argument in favor of foregrounding your own claims and findings.
- **Cheyne vs. Morton:** You argue convincingly for the relevance of both, but could clarify their differences: To what extent do their models overlap, and where might their readings yield different conclusions about Clarissa?

#### 3. **Clarity on Terminology and Concepts**
- **Define “Nervous Consumption”:** Although you quote Morton, a two-sentence digest defining it (as understood then vs. now) in your own words would be helpful.
- **Constitution:** You do good work with this concept, but a slightly earlier and clearer definition of what it means in the eighteenth-century versus modern medical parlance would be useful.

#### 4. **Development of “Embodiment”**
- **More on Gender:** You touch briefly on gender and the “ideal English gentlewoman,” but could expand: does this medicalization of women’s suffering tie into moral, gendered, or political discourses of the period?
- **Lingering Symbolism:** While you convincingly present Clarissa as a physical being, you could acknowledge how her bodily decline also functions symbolically—without reducing it *solely* to symbol.

#### 5. **Minor Stylistic/Editorial Issues**
- **Paragraphs:** Some paragraphs are long and could be broken up for readability.
- **Typos:** Minor (e.g. “edutions” for “editions”; “waverings and equivocatings” is creative but could be tightened).
- **Redundancy:** Occasionally, points are repeated (e.g. the interlinking of diet, spirit, and constitution); watch for conciseness.

#### 6. **Conclusion**
- **Future Directions:** The conclusion is generally strong but could point briefly to the broader critical or historical implications of this perspective for Richardson studies, or for eighteenth-century literature/medical humanities more broadly.

### Overall Assessment

**This is an impressively researched, well-argued, and original paper.** You succeed in weaving together literary analysis, historical-medical context, and philosophical inquiry in a sophisticated way. Your paper not only shows mastery of Clarissa and its criticism, but also demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary work. With a little more explicit engagement with counterarguments and an even sharper focus on your intervention, this could be a submission-worthy essay for a graduate seminar or even, with expansion, a conference.

**Grade: A / A- (high graduate level work)**
