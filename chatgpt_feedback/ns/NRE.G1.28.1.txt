Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on the "Frog Island Community Garden: Giving Ypsilanti Food for Thought and Learning!" proposal, focusing on structure, clarity, content, and overall effectiveness.

---

## **General Impressions**

This is a well-written, compelling, and clearly structured proposal. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the challenges facing Ypsilanti and articulates how the community garden can address community, health, economic, and environmental needs. The inclusion of a literature review, logic model, timeline, and budget all contribute to the professionalism and credibility of the application.

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Clear and Engaging Abstract**
- The abstract concisely introduces the garden’s goals, proposed activities, and funding needs. 
- The objectives are specific and meaningful.

### 2. **Contextual Background and Relevance**
- The introduction and literature review make a strong case for why this project is needed in Ypsilanti (e.g., limited access to healthy food, need for community spaces).
- The writing effectively ties local issues to broader trends (urban food deserts, environmental education, and community building).

### 3. **Evidence-Based Approach**
- The use of references throughout lends credibility and situates the project in current academic and practical discourse.
- Statistics about local health and food security support the urgency of the project.

### 4. **Clear Goals and Measurable Objectives**
- Goals are well-defined and align with the desired outcomes (knowledge, caring, community engagement).
- Each goal is paired with measurable objectives and planned evaluation methods.
- The inclusion of a control group for evaluation adds rigor.

### 5. **Detailed Methods and Roles**
- The plan for both the demonstration garden and the native restoration area is concrete and actionable.
- Roles and responsibilities are defined (e.g., FICG planning team, DDA’s administrative support, UM graduate student evaluation).
- Timeline and budget are clear and realistic.

### 6. **Strong Fit with Funding Source**
- The proposal explicitly connects the project to the DTE Energy Foundation’s mission and past-funded projects.

## **Areas for Improvement / Suggestions**

### 1. **Formatting and Flow**
- **Images and Captions:** Consider more cohesive integration of photos/diagrams within the text. Each should have a descriptive caption that ties directly into the narrative.
- **Section Headings:** Some headers could be more visually distinct for ease of reference (e.g., make Goals and Objectives/Methods bold and/or larger).
- **Appendices:** Explicitly reference each appendix in the body when relevant (e.g., “See Appendix 4 for timeline”), which you already do in some cases.

### 2. **Clarity and Accessibility**
- **Jargon Minimization:** While the grant readers will likely be familiar with gardening/environmental terms, aim to define less common terms or strategies (e.g., companion planting, Likert scale) briefly for accessibility.
- **Objective Clarity:** The numbers in objectives (“identify 3-5 native and 3-5 invasive species...”) might be clarified (why this range? Is “3” or “5” the goal?).

### 3. **Outcomes and Impact**
- **Quantitative Targets:** In some sections, 60% knowledge gain is projected as an expected outcome, vs. the 75% success rate in earlier objectives. Align these a bit more clearly.
- **Long-term Sustainability:** What will happen after the initial grant period? Briefly address sustainability or plans to maintain/expand the project after funding ends.
- **Community Involvement:** You mention non-member visitors and logs for attendance; is there a plan to actively recruit or market to underrepresented residents? More detail could strengthen claims of inclusivity.

### 4. **Budget Detail**
- The budget is clearly presented and seems comprehensive, but a short narrative paragraph summarizing key expense categories and justifying the larger line items would be helpful (not just the table).

### 5. **Minor Style and Grammar**
- Overall, the writing is strong, but review for some repetitive phrases (e.g., “interpretive signs” is used frequently, sometimes in consecutive sentences).
- Ensure tense consistency throughout (some shifts between present and future).

## **Conclusion**

**Overall, this proposal is exemplary in its structure, evidence, vision, and practicality.** It is well-matched to the funder’s mission, demonstrates community involvement and benefit, and provides clear evaluation plans. By slightly clarifying a few objectives, tightening the integration of appendices and images, and briefly outlining sustainability, it would be even stronger.

**Great job!** If you’d like, I can help you edit a section or draft sample language for particular improvements. Let me know how I can support further!
