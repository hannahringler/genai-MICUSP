Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement:

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Theoretical Grounding and Use of Sources**
   - You effectively root your argument in sociological theory, especially with clear references to West & Zimmerman ("doing gender"), Kessler & McKenna, Connell, and others.
   - Consistent citation of primary sources (e.g., Thorne’s classroom observations, Lorber's ideology critique) strengthens your analytical frame and grounds abstract points in observed reality.

2. **Argument Clarity**
   - The thesis is clear: Gender in elementary classrooms is a *social construction* maintained through individual action and institutional structure, and it becomes a "natural attitude" shaping children's lifelong understandings of gender.
   - Key concepts—*doing gender*, *gender as a social institution*, *gender accountability*—are explained well and returned to throughout the essay.

3. **Organization and Flow**
   - The paper follows a logical structure: introducing theoretical concepts, illustrating them with classroom examples, and drawing wider conclusions about the formation and persistence of gender norms.

4. **Use of Examples**
   - Drawing on detailed ethnographic observations (e.g., classroom seating, playground activities, lip gloss examples) helps concretize abstract theories and shows you can connect theory to lived reality.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Engagement with Counterarguments**
   - While the paper is grounded in social constructionist theory, it might be strengthened by briefly acknowledging other perspectives (for example, essentialist or biological viewpoints) before indicating why the social constructionist view is more adequate for your analysis.
   - Addressing potential criticisms—even if only to refute them—demonstrates critical engagement and depth.

2. **More Direct Analysis of Classroom Implications**
   - The paper frames elementary classrooms as settings where gender is reinforced, but you could speak more directly to the impacts: How might these early experiences affect students long-term? What are the consequences for children who deviate from norms? (You hint at this, but could give more detail.)
   - Suggest practical interventions or ways teachers could disrupt these processes—this makes the paper more actionable and policy-relevant.

3. **Transitions and Signposting**
   - Some transitions between theory and example are abrupt. For instance, after discussing West & Zimmerman, you move straight into Barrie Thorne’s observations—consider signaling the shift (“For example, in Barrie Thorne’s ethnography…”).
   - Likewise, drawing explicit connections between individual examples and broader social patterns will make your argument easier to follow for readers less familiar with the literature.

4. **Stylistic Issues**
   - Minor grammar/typo: "embrace[sic] teen culture" should be "embraced teen culture" (or explain the [sic], or paraphrase).
   - Sometimes, sentences are long and could be broken up for clarity (especially in paragraphs where several theorists are mentioned).
   - Watch for redundancy in key points—you reiterate “gender as something we do” frequently; these could be streamlined for conciseness.

5. **Conclusion**
   - The final paragraph summarizes well, but it could be stronger by reiterating the significance of your argument and possibly gesturing toward broader implications (e.g., beyond elementary school, how these patterns persist or transform in adulthood or other institutions).

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong, theoretically-informed essay with clear arguments and well-chosen examples. Strengthening counterargument engagement, smoothing transitions, and expanding on consequences and practical implications would take the paper from good to excellent. Great work synthesizing complex concepts into accessible analysis!
