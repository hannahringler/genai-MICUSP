Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on the paper analyzing Luis Alberto Urrea’s *The Devil’s Highway*:

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Summary and Organization:**  
   The writer provides a thorough summary of each section of the book and follows the book’s structure in the analysis. This makes it easy for the reader to follow the argument and understand the narrative arc as well as the key points of Urrea’s work.

2. **Engagement with the Text:**  
   The paper goes beyond simple summary and offers thoughtful engagement with Urrea’s choices, such as his use of in-scene writing, descriptive techniques, and structure. The writer isn’t afraid to challenge the author’s choices and adds their own opinions, which demonstrates active critical thinking.

3. **Personal Reflection:**  
   The writer connects the book’s content to their own prior views and explores how the book affected their perspectives. This enhances the personal value of the analysis and shows genuine interaction with the material.

4. **Balanced Critique:**  
   Both strengths and weaknesses of the book are addressed. The writer acknowledges the book’s success in humanizing migrants, while also critiquing storytelling choices, tone, and credibility.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Thesis and Analytical Depth:**  
   While the paper effectively summarizes the book and gives opinions, the central thesis could be more distinctly articulated. What is the overall judgment or takeaway about *The Devil’s Highway*? Articulating a concise thesis in the introduction would help tie the various observations together more strongly.

2. **Evidence and Support for Critiques:**  
   At times, the writer makes assertions (e.g., about Urrea’s condescending tone or overuse of certain themes) but doesn’t present enough direct evidence or specific examples from the text. Providing more direct quotes or closer readings would strengthen these critiques—for instance, what specific language (besides "wetback") feels disrespectful?

3. **Tone and Language:**  
   The paper sometimes shifts in tone from academic/objective (e.g., “I also contend that Urrea’s style was too jumpy…”) to conversational and subjective (e.g., “Why would a reader believe Urrea…”). While some personal reflection is valuable, maintaining a more consistent analytical/academic voice throughout would make the paper stronger.

4. **Clarity and Conciseness:**  
   Some sentences are quite long or contain repeated ideas, which can make the argument harder to follow. For instance, some criticism sections about what Urrea could or couldn’t speculate about the migrants’ plight could be tightened for clarity.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   The conclusion effectively sums up the argument and even offers a practical suggestion for teaching the book. However, it could more specifically reiterate the main critical points and reaffirm the significance of the book—and the analysis—more forcefully.

**Suggestions for Revision:**

- **Craft a succinct thesis statement** in the introduction to anchor the analysis.
- **Integrate more direct textual evidence** for critiques to increase credibility.
- **Polish language for clarity and conciseness,** especially in critiques.
- **Maintain a consistent analytical tone,** even in sections of personal reflection.
- **Reinforce the conclusion** by linking back to the thesis and the broader implications for readers or society.

**Overall:**  
This is a thoughtful, well-organized, and reflective review that demonstrates clear engagement with Urrea’s text. With a tighter thesis, more textual evidence, and a bit more polish, it would rise to the level of an excellent critical analysis. Great work!
