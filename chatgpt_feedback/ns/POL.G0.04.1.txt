Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, **“The Democratic Inadequacies of the European Union.”** The feedback is organized into several key areas: **organization/structure, argument and analysis, use of evidence, style and clarity, and suggestions for improvement**.

---

### 1. **Organization & Structure**

**Strengths:**
- The paper is well-organized, starting with a clear introduction that lays out the background and central problem (the EU’s democratic deficit).
- Each section tackles a specific aspect (institutions, elections, referenda, solutions), allowing for good flow.
- The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points and reinforces the thesis.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Consider adding more explicit subheadings (e.g., “The Structure of EU Institutions,” “Parliamentary Weaknesses,” “Participation Through Referenda,” “Reform Proposals”). This will help guide the reader and clarify when you shift from diagnosis to solutions.

### 2. **Argument & Analysis**

**Strengths:**
- Your thesis is clearly stated, and you maintain focus throughout on the “democratic deficit.”
- You draw useful distinctions between the various EU institutions and their modes of accountability.
- You address counterarguments (e.g., Majone’s position) and explain why critics may oppose greater democratization.
- The analysis of why EP elections have low turnout and “second-order” status is relevant and well developed.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- In the “Support for Less Democratic Input” section, you could more explicitly weigh the pros and cons of technocracy vs democracy.
- The transition from problem analysis to recommendations feels a bit abrupt. Preparing the reader by summarizing the main problems before presenting solutions can strengthen the logical progression.
- The paper would benefit from mentioning recent EU treaty reforms (such as Lisbon) and their limited impact, to reinforce the timeliness of the topic.

### 3. **Use of Evidence & Sources**

**Strengths:**
- The paper references a good range of academic sources to back up points.
- Key arguments are supported with specific examples (Swiss referendum, French/Dutch “No” votes).

**Areas for Improvement:**
- More up-to-date or additional empirical examples (even as of 2009–2010) could reinforce your claims—such as discussing the growing role of the European Citizens’ Initiative or more recent voter turnout statistics.
- At times, direct quotes are slightly overused from McCormick. You could paraphrase more to demonstrate your understanding.

### 4. **Style & Clarity**

**Strengths:**
- The tone is academic and argumentative, appropriate for the subject matter.
- You define key terms and make complex institutional structures understandable.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some sentences are overly long or a bit repetitive. Shortening sentences and varying structure would improve readability.
- Be careful with generalizations such as, “European citizens lack motivation…”—clarify when you mean “many” or “most.”
- Minor proofreading errors (e.g., singular/plural agreement, missing words) exist—review for polish.

### 5. **Suggestions for Improvement & Extension**

1. **Comparative Perspective:**  
   Consider mentioning how other supranational organizations or federations (e.g., the US federal system, German Bundesrat) handle democratic legitimacy.

2. **Recent Developments:**  
   Acknowledge efforts like treaty revisions, the European Citizens’ Initiative, or transparency reforms. Discuss why/if they fall short.

3. **Wider Context:**  
   Discuss the implications of the democratic deficit for legitimacy, public support, and the future of integration (e.g., link to rise of Euroscepticism).

4. **More Nuanced Critique:**  
   Recognize the unique challenges of supranational democracy—e.g., linguistic, cultural, and political diversity.

### **Summary Statement**

**Overall, this is a strong, thoughtful, and well-researched paper that demonstrates good understanding of the structure and challenges of the EU.** To make it even better, clarify transitions, streamline your style, and broaden your empirical and comparative illustrations. Consider more explicit engagement with recent reforms and the deeper question of what kind of democracy is realistically possible at the EU level.
