Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback and critique of your paper, "That's Some Fancy Thinkin': Accounting for Pretended Ideas in Hume's Treatise."

---

### Overall Impression

This is an ambitious and sophisticated engagement with some of the thorniest issues in Hume’s *Treatise*—namely, the status of “pretended ideas” (such as body, substance, and necessary connection) and the apparent dilemma they present for Hume’s empiricist theory of meaning. The paper demonstrates:

- Deep textual knowledge of the *Treatise* and secondary resources (e.g., Abstract references).
- Strong interpretive skills, especially in drawing careful distinctions between different Humean concepts and argumentative strategies.
- Creative, original analysis that moves beyond summary and engages the philosophical puzzle at hand.

**Your central thesis**—that Hume is not strictly caught between pointlessness and rationalism regarding pretended ideas, but has a more nuanced position—is timely, interesting, and well motivated.

## Strengths

### 1. **Thorough Engagement with Hume**
You not only cite Hume’s text but demonstrate command of key passages, nuances, and developments (e.g., the two kinds of complex ideas, distinction between vulgar and philosophical ideas of body, “copy principle” and its exceptions).

### 2. **Logical Structure**
Your paper is well organized, with a clear introduction, explicit recognition of the dilemma, stepwise examination of the core cases (body, substance, necessary connection), and focused conclusion tying your threads together.

### 3. **Nuanced Argumentation**
The way you show how “pretended ideas” can have content (sometimes misleading or confused content) is nuanced and supported by good textual evidence (e.g., on circularity and the imagination's role).

### 4. **Charitable, Careful Reading**
You avoid strawman attacks on Hume, and you note where your interpretations go beyond the explicit letter of the Treatise, which is scholarly and intellectually honest.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Clarity and Brevity**
The writing is often dense and at times *overly elaborate*, especially in explanations that could be more succinct. Some sentences are convoluted. For example,

> "We must therefore conclude that our idea of it has some other origin. What is puzzling about this is the fact that body appears to be a paradigmatic candidate to be a pretended idea: there is and can be no impression from which this idea is derived, yet Hume almost never thinks of it in these terms."

*Suggestion*: Consider breaking up long sentences and aiming for greater directness, especially in exposition.

### 2. **Explicit Thesis Restatement**
While the central aim is clear, the thesis could be stated more impactfully and concisely in both the introduction and conclusion. For example, you could have a bold statement like:

> "I will argue that Hume can and does account for the content of pretended ideas through the imagination’s recombination of experiential content, thus avoiding both the charge of rationalism and the charge of intellectual futility."

### 3. **Engagement with Secondary Literature**
You primarily analyze Hume directly, with almost no explicit engagement with secondary literature. Given the graduate level, it would strengthen your case to briefly situate your interpretation in relation to key commentators (e.g., Garrett, Stroud, Don Garrett, Galen Strawson, etc.), even if only in footnotes.

### 4. **Some Redundancy/Over-Explanation**
In places, you belabor distinctions that could be made more quickly (e.g., the difference between vulgar and philosophical ideas of body, or the mechanics of complex idea formation). 

*Suggestion*: Streamline repetitive points, especially when setting up obvious Humean distinctions.

### 5. **Footnote on 'Change' Admits Weakness**
Your honest footnote admitting the difficulty of grounding “change” in Hume is commendable, but it could be even stronger if you suggested or referenced a possible solution (perhaps citing literature that addresses “bundling” and the “self”). A short reference or brief sketch of alternatives would show broad awareness.

### 6. **Conclusion Could Be Stronger**
Your conclusion is somewhat low-key, emphasizing Hume’s confusion as forgiveable and understandable. You could more forcefully restate your thesis and the implications of your reading, perhaps by gesturing toward what it means for the broader empiricist project or for Hume’s legacy.

## Specific Comments

- **Quotations:** Your use of textual evidence is excellent, but sometimes you quote at extended length and could instead summarize when the point is relatively straightforward.
- **Section Transitions:** Generally strong, but occasionally abrupt (e.g., between the idea of body and the modern philosophy).
- **Original Examples:** Your example of “pudding and raisins” neatly illustrates inhesion—keep using vivid, clear illustrations like this.
- **Terminology:** You’re generally clear, but sometimes a reader unfamiliar with Hume might get lost. A brief definition of “pretended idea” in the introduction (for clarity) would help.

## Overall Evaluation

**Grade level (if applicable):** High B+ to A- at the graduate level, certainly in the A range at the undergraduate level. The argument is substantial, innovative, and closely reasoned. With minor tightening, greater brevity, and a few secondary source references, it would be an A/A+.

**Strengths:** Ambitious, original, close reading, interpretively acute.

**Improvements:** Tighter exposition, slightly shorter sections on established distinctions, more systematic citing of commentary.

---

### Summary

You have a strong, original, well-structured paper that makes a real contribution to interpreting a notorioulsy difficult aspect of Hume’s *Treatise*. With minor stylistic tightening and some engagement with secondary literature, this would be publishable-level graduate work. Well done!
