Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, “2D Electronic Spectroscopy of Biological Systems.”

### **Content/Scientific Merit**

**Strengths:**
- **Clear context and motivation:** You explain why the study of ultrafast energy transfer in biological systems is important, especially in relation to photosynthetic complexes and DNA photolyase. This situates your work well.
- **Appropriate method:** The choice of 2D Electronic Spectroscopy (2DES) is well-justified, including its relationship to NMR and the unique information it provides (e.g., separating homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening, transition dipoles, and coupling).
- **Logical structure:** Motivation, theory, experimental setup, and preliminary work are all presented in a logical, comprehensible sequence.
- **Figures:** Figures 1 and 2 are useful in visualizing the experimental process and expected data, which is crucial for readers less familiar with 2DES.
- **References:** You cite recent and foundational literature, supporting the points you make and allowing readers to dig deeper.

**Suggestions:**
- **More background on 2DES:** While you mention it as an optical analogue of 2D NMR, a brief explanation of why this technique has only recently become feasible (e.g., “passive phase stability”) would benefit readers less familiar with the field.
- **Application depth:** The focus is split between calibration on FRET-labeled DNA and moving on to larger biological complexes. Consider expanding a bit on the specific questions you hope 2DES will answer that cannot be addressed with other methods, especially in complex systems.
- **Broader impacts:** Add a couple of sentences about the broader significance of understanding energy transfer in photosynthesis or DNA repair (e.g., implications for artificial photosynthesis, solar energy, biotechnology).

### **Clarity and Organization**

**Strengths:**
- **Well-organized sections:** Each part builds on the last (Motivation → Methods → Experimental Setup).
- **Clear explanations:** Complex concepts like FRET and the pulse sequence are explained succinctly and understandably for the physical chemistry or physics audience.

**Suggestions:**
- **Flow between sections:** Sometimes, the transition between technical description and rationale feels abrupt. For instance, add connecting sentences explaining how calibration with DNA strands translates to work on more complex systems.
- **Figure captions:** Your captions are generally clear but could be a bit more descriptive, especially for readers new to 2DES (e.g., “what are ‘boxcar’ geometries”).
- **Equation formatting:** The FRET equation is a bit unclear due to the formatting (possibly a result of OCR or typesetting). Make sure it’s clearly typeset in your final version.

### **Specific Details & Language**

**Strengths:**
- **Accurately defined technical terms** (e.g., population, coherence, phase-matching) and their significance.
- **Use of illustrative examples:** Rhodamine-6G as a benchmark, DNA with site-specific fluorophores as a calibration.

**Suggestions:**
- **Minor typos/awkward phrases** (e.g., “scanable” should be “scannable,” “complex valued” → “complex-valued,” “relaxation time” could be defined more precisely).
- **Units:** Whenever you mention “femtosecond to picosecond,” you might want to add the actual time scales (10^-15 to 10^-12 s).
- **References in square brackets** sometimes have an extra period (e.g., [6].). Those should be corrected to [6].
- **Context for less-common abbreviations:** On the first appearance of “NOPA,” spell out “non-collinear optical parametric amplifier.”

### **Overall Impression**

This is a strong, clear, and well-organized proposal. It demonstrates understanding of both the experimental technique and the biological importance of the problem. With a few improvements for clarity—especially for non-expert or interdisciplinary readers—it could be even stronger. 

**Summary of Actionable Feedback:**
- Slightly expand on recent advances allowing 2DES in biological systems.
- Clearly lay out the progression from DNA calibration experiments to complex biological systems and what new insights 2DES is expected to provide.
- Add a brief note on broader impacts.
- Clean up minor typos and ensure equations are formatted correctly.
- Make figure captions even more descriptive.

If you have a word limit, focus on clarifying the experimental rationale and connections between your calibration system and target systems.
