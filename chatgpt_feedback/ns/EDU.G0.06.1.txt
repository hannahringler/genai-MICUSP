Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on your paper based on several key areas: **clarity, structure, use of evidence/examples, teaching practice, and mechanics/style**. 

---

### **Strengths**

#### 1. **Clarity and Focus**
- You have a clear focus on questioning strategies in the context of teaching tessellations.  
- The purpose of your paper—to demonstrate purposeful questioning and its impact in the classroom—is well established in the introduction and maintained throughout.

#### 2. **Use of Specific Examples**
- You effectively use specific, time-stamped classroom discussion snippets (“00:40”, “07:48”, etc.) to illustrate your questioning techniques. This grounds your reflection in real practice.
- Examples (e.g., Ryan’s misconception, Laura’s answer, Evan’s angle measurement idea) vividly demonstrate both eliciting and probing questions.

#### 3. **Reflection on Teaching Practices**
- You explicitly connect theory (from Chapin’s “Classroom Discussions”) to practice, showing you understand not just what to do, but why.
- The explanation of how misconceptions were uncovered and addressed is a strong point, highlighting your diagnostic teaching.

#### 4. **Making Connections**
- You provide a clear example of how you guided students to make mathematical connections—specifically, relating angle measures to tessellation. 
- You note this was “advanced” for fifth graders, and reflect on how sequencing questions helped students succeed, which demonstrates thoughtful lesson planning.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### 1. **Structure and Organization**
- Consider using subheadings or separated paragraphs for each major type of question (eliciting, probing, connecting), which would make your analysis easier to follow.
- The transition between examples and analysis sometimes gets blurred—try to separate description of events from your interpretation and reflection.

#### 2. **Analysis and Depth**
- While you describe what happened, try to analyze *why* each method was effective (or not) in more depth. For example, what specifically about your questioning helped move students’ thinking forward?
- You mention “advanced concepts” and “carefully sequenced questioning,” but you could explicitly outline your rationale for the order of questions.

#### 3. **Evidence of Impact on Students**
- You mention student participation and some outcomes (e.g., uncovering misconceptions, successful reasoning), but adding a brief summary of how students’ understanding shifted would further strengthen your reflection.
- If possible, reference specific student statements or common errors as evidence of growth in understanding.

#### 4. **Mechanics and Style**
- Overall, your writing is clear, but be mindful of run-on sentences (e.g., the long explanatory sentences could be split for better readability).
- Try to use students’ pseudonyms consistently and only include quotes from students when they provide insight, to keep the narrative concise.
- Watch small redundancies, for instance, “So can we add 60 to itself or multiply 60 by something to get 360?” could be streamlined.

#### 5. **Citation and Attribution**
- Your citation of Chapin is correct but could be referenced more consistently. Consider in-text citations (“(Chapin, 2003)”), especially if this is an academic assignment.
- Consider referencing your own learning (“From the reading, I learned…”) to further show the integration of theory and practice.

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a strong example of reflective practice, showing thoughtful and intentional use of questioning in math instruction. You connect theory to practice effectively and use classroom evidence to make your points. To improve, clarify your structure, deepen your analysis of classroom discourse, and ensure impact on students’ learning is explicit. 

**Well done!**
