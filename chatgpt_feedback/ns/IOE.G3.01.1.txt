Certainly! Below is detailed feedback on the paper “Water Utility Efficiency Assessment Using a Data Envelopment Analysis Procedure,” organized by standard academic criteria: **structure, clarity, methodology, analysis, originality, and overall impact**. At the end, I include **actionable suggestions for improvement**.

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Structure and Organization**
- The paper follows a clear academic structure: **Abstract, Introduction, Background, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion (Summary), Acknowledgements, and References**.
- Transitions between sections are logical, making it easy to follow the flow of ideas.
- Research objectives are defined early and revisited in the conclusions.

### **2. Clarity and Writing Style**
- The writing is generally clear, professional, and appropriately formal for an academic research paper.
- Jargon (such as DEA, WMW) is explained, making the methodology accessible to readers with some background in efficiency studies.
- The summary concisely revisits and interprets the results in light of the research questions.

### **3. Methodology**
- The **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)** method is well-chosen, well-defined, and justified for the application.
- Key decisions, such as using non-discretionary (non-controllable) outputs for utilities, are explained.
- Care is taken with data cleaning, with transparent discussion about limitations (e.g., missing or illogical data entries).

### **4. Analysis and Discussion**
- The **findings are clearly stated and well-supported by data**: public utilities are most efficient, followed by private not-for-profits, with private for-profits least efficient.
- Breakdown of efficiency by **ownership type and water source** is systematic, detailed, and reflects deep analysis with multiple variable sets.
- **Discussion of variable selection and informational spread** shows critical thinking about methodological choices and their impact.

### **5. Originality and Contribution**
- The study advances previous work by:  
    - Focusing on **non-discretionary variables**.
    - Including a nuanced examination of variable selection and its marginal returns.
    - Using a large, real-world dataset (US EPA Community Water System Survey).

## **Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement**

### **1. Clarity and Accessibility**
- **Length and density**: The paper is dense and could be more reader-friendly by summarizing lengthy findings in tables/charts, not just in text.
- **Figures/Tables**: Only two figures are included; more summarized data (e.g., tables showing main efficiency scores for each utility type) would help.
- **Explanation of statistical methods**: The WMW (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney) test is explained, but actual statistical results (p-values, significance thresholds) could be more visible in tables.

### **2. Literature Review**
- While the background is thorough, it could be improved by **directly comparing the current study’s results to more recent/related work in the literature**, not only in the background section but also in the conclusion.

### **3. Methodological Transparency**
- More information on **DEA model specification** could be included: Which software settings? Were any sensitivity analyses done?
- The **selection of input/output variables** is key: the reasoning is explained, but a table (like Table 1) should be referenced earlier and used in the main text for clarity.

### **4. Discussion and Interpretation**
- Some important **practical implications** of the findings (e.g., for policy-makers or utility managers) could be further developed, especially regarding why public utilities might be more efficient.
- The **limitations** are acknowledged (e.g., no quality data), but could be discussed in more depth (potential bias from excluded data/utilities).

### **5. Visualizations**
- Figure 2 on marginal returns is helpful, but needs a more detailed caption (explain what “dimensionless spread” means, interpret why curves flatten).
- Figure 1 could be better annotated, with a clearer key/legend for readers unfamiliar with the abbreviations.

## **Actionable Suggestions**
1. **Add a summary table** in the results section compiling the main efficiency scores and significance for each utility type and variable set.
2. **Improve visual aids**: Use more figures or tables to summarize findings. Each should have a detailed caption and all abbreviations should be spelled out.
3. **Highlight key findings visually**: Consider bolding or boxing the central conclusions in the summary or an “Implications” sub-section.
4. **Deepen discussion of limitations and future research**: Be more specific about which limitations most impact the findings and suggest concrete ways future studies could address them.
5. **Expand on policy implications**: Briefly discuss why public utilities might be more efficient (governance, scale, incentives), and what this suggests for utility management and regulation.
6. **Explicitly reference all figures/tables** in the main text when describing results.
7. **Balance technical detail with readability**: Summarize dense or repetitive sections and move technical or dataset specifics to an appendix if needed.
8. **Use p-values or confidence intervals** alongside t-statistics for clarity so non-statisticians can better interpret results.

## **Overall Assessment**

This is a **well-executed, rigorous, and meaningful research paper** that makes a significant contribution to the quantitative evaluation of utility efficiency. Improved visualization, summary tables, and expanded practical discussion would increase its impact and accessibility to a broader audience, including policy-makers and industry practitioners. Minor clarifications and additions, as suggested above, would further strengthen the paper.
