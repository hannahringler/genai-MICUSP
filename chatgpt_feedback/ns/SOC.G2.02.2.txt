Certainly! Here is a detailed feedback breakdown of your paper, “Reading Lovejoy’s Reading of Rousseau’s Discourse on Inequality.” I will address **argument/narrative**, **structure and organization**, **clarity and style**, **engagement with sources**, and **general suggestions**.

---

## 1. **Argument and Analysis**

**Strengths:**
- You clearly engage with both Rousseau’s original text and Lovejoy’s interpretation, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of the relationship between primary and secondary sources.
- Your thesis—that Lovejoy offers a nuanced counter-reading to the “noble savage” myth, highlighting Rousseau’s ambivalence and complexity—comes across clearly and consistently frames the discussion.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- At times your argument could be foregrounded or stated more explicitly, particularly for readers less familiar with the debate. A stronger introductory paragraph that succinctly lays out what you will argue (and why this matters for reading Rousseau today) would help ground the reader.

## 2. **Structure and Organization**

**Strengths:**
- The structure largely follows the unfolding of Lovejoy’s analysis, broken into Rousseau’s four ‘states’ and the core ideas you wish to emphasize (potentiality, perfectibility, self-love/selfishness).
- Transitions between sections are generally clear.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The paper is dense, with some long paragraphs. Consider breaking up complex concepts (such as the distinctions between self-love and selfishness, or the analysis of the four stages) into shorter paragraphs for readability.
- At the end of long interpretive passages, more “signposting” or summary might help; reiterate how a given section supports your main argument.

## 3. **Clarity and Style**

**Strengths:**
- The prose is generally precise, careful, and appropriately formal for graduate-level writing.
- You explain complex philosophical concepts in your own words, which demonstrates mastery.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- On occasion, the writing can be a little abstract or dense (for example, “Desire reaches backwards through time in search of the point of disarticulation”—while elegant, could be clarified).
- Some sentences could be streamlined; watch out for overly long constructions or unnecessarily complex syntax.

## 4. **Engagement with Sources**

**Strengths:**
- Detailed citation of primary and secondary sources (Lovejoy and Rousseau) shows careful research.
- Footnotes and direct quotations are used effectively to support points.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The discussion is heavily filtered through Lovejoy. While that is the paper’s premise, you might occasionally step back to explicitly evaluate the strengths or limitations of Lovejoy’s reading itself, rather than adopting it wholesale.
- Consider referencing a wider range of scholarship (if space allows) to situate Lovejoy’s essay within ongoing Rousseau criticism.

---

## 5. **Conclusion and Implications**

**Strengths:**
- The conclusion nicely ties Rousseau’s nostalgia to other contemporary discourses, suggesting the enduring relevance of these ideas.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The final paragraph is conceptually rich; however, it could be made more pointed by more directly stating the stakes or contemporary significance of your reading—for example, what does the nostalgia for a “lost state” mean for how we approach political theory today?

---

## 6. **General Suggestions**

- Double-check for small typographical errors and consistent citation formatting.
- If this is for a class, make sure you are meeting specific assignment guidelines (e.g., required number of sources, length).
- If possible, include a short introductory roadmap that tells your reader exactly how your paper will proceed.

**Overall Evaluation:**  
This is a well-researched and sophisticated engagement with both Rousseau and Lovejoy, demonstrating thoughtful textual analysis and fluent writing. With some tightening up in structure, stylistic clarity, and explicit argumentation, this could be an excellent paper suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate-level work.
