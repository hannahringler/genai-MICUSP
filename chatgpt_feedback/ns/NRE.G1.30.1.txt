## Overall Feedback

### Strengths

**1. Personal Engagement:**  
You demonstrate real personal involvement with your chosen topic. The narrative about your yoga journey, especially the reflection on conquering a handstand, feels authentic and compelling.

**2. Link to Course Themes:**  
You do an excellent job connecting your experience to academic topics like stress and coping, as well as physiological explanations (e.g., fight-or-flight, sympathetic nervous system, hormone response).

**3. Reflection and Self-Awareness:**  
Your journal excerpts and reflections are insightful, showing a depth of self-awareness. The passage about feeling gratitude for your body and noticing the mind-body connection is especially strong.

**4. Application of Theory to Practice:**  
You not only describe yoga practice but also relate it to theoretical concepts from your course, e.g., stress response, mental vitality, attentional capacity.

**5. Honesty about Limitations:**  
You acknowledge challenges—such as doubts regarding the “real” effects vs. expected effects, the problem of data collection interfering with relaxation, and external stressors impacting results. This transparency is valuable.

### Suggestions for Improvement

**1. Organization & Structure:**  
- The essay is mostly well organized, but consider clearer section divisions (possibly with headings), such as Introduction, Method, Reflection, Discussion, and Conclusion. This would make the flow easier to follow.
- The ending might benefit from a brief recap or conclusion that restates your key findings/benefits from the practice and links back to your opening.

**2. Academic Tone/Consistency:**  
- The paper alternates between informal journal-style entries and academic analysis. While the personal voice is engaging, you could strike a more consistent balance. Consider framing journal excerpts within more academically toned analysis.
- Be sure not to overuse casual language like “as difficult as it can be to get out of bed earlier.” Alternatively, preface personal comments with statements like “From a personal perspective…”

**3. Depth of Analysis:**  
- You touch on the physiological mechanisms of stress and the mind-body practice, but could even more explicitly elaborate on how your yoga practice mediates these responses using citations or references to research (if the assignment allows).
- Consider briefly mentioning different types or schools of yoga and why Vinyasa was particularly appropriate for your goals.

**4. Quantitative Data:**  
- While you mention survey data and mental vitality, no data are presented or described in detail. Including even a brief summary of trends (mean scores, specific changes) would strengthen your argument about yoga’s effectiveness.

**5. Minor Points:**  
- There are a few typos and small grammatical issues, but nothing major. Proofreading for these (e.g., consistent use of tenses, smoothing transitions) would polish the paper.

**6. Reference to Literature:**  
- If permitted, adding even a couple of in-text citations to research (e.g., literature supporting yoga for stress reduction) would ground your narrative in broader context.

### Closing Remarks

You have written a heartfelt, thoughtful, and intellectually engaged paper. Your personal observations are insightful and very relevant to the assignment’s objectives. With some minor structural tweaks, possible inclusion of quantitative data and references, and attention to academic tone, this paper could be even stronger.

**Keep practicing yoga, and keep writing reflectively—both seem to be making a positive difference!**
