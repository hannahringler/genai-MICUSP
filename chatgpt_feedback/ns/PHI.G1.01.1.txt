Certainly! Below is a detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on argumentation, clarity, structure, use of philosophical sources, and suggestions for improvement.

## Overall Comments

This is a thoughtful and well-structured essay that deals deeply with the metaphysical puzzle of material constitution, focused on the relationship between a statue (Peter) and the lump of clay (Lump) from which it is made. You clearly understand the major positions and arguments in this debate, and your engagement with figures like Kit Fine, Kripke, Lewis, and Judith Jarvis Thomson reflects a strong grasp of the literature. Your writing is generally clear and precise, and you do a good job mapping the terrain before launching your own argument.

## Strengths

**1. Philosophical Depth and Engagement**
- You show awareness of the central issues: the law of identity, properties and modal properties, essence, and possible worlds.
- Your use of secondary literature—Fine on essence, Kripke on rigid designation, Lewis on counterpart relations, Thomson on ontological levels—is highly appropriate.
- The contrasts you draw (such as between “a poem” and “the words on the page,” or Andy Egan’s properties) are helpful for clarifying abstract points.

**2. Structure and Organization**
- You begin by clearly stating the philosophical question.
- You systematically outline the two-thinger and one-thinger positions and address possible objections to both.
- Your argument moves logically through responses, culminating in your own position and clarifying its implications.

**3. Clarity in Exposition**
- The paper is generally readable and accessible, even while dealing with complex metaphysical distinctions.
- You successfully anticipate and address standard objections, indicating an ability to think critically about potential weaknesses in your own argument.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Articulation of the Core Argument**
- While you argue for a one-thinger position, there are moments where your positive argument could be clearer. For instance, are you offering a purely semantic solution (i.e., “statue” is simply a way of presenting “lump”), or are you making a more robust metaphysical claim?
- It may help to explicitly lay out your main positive argument in stepwise fashion. For example: a) All properties ascribed to Peter can be ascribed to Lump; b) Apparent modal differences arise from our linguistic or conceptual practices, not from metaphysical differences; c) etc.

**2. Engagement with Objections**
- You are fair in presenting objections to both views, but your responses occasionally feel underdeveloped:
    - For example, early in the essay, you say you are “not convinced that [the reply] will be successful” for the Lump/Peter case, but you don’t fully spell out why.
    - When you relinquish a “knock-down argument,” you should clarify why you think holding the “many-thinger” view is more problematic—are there counterintuitive consequences, or does it violate certain metaphysical or epistemic principles?

**3. Clarity around Terms**
- At times the distinction between modal, non-modal, and essential properties is blurred. An explicit definition early on may add precision.
- Similarly, it will help to clarify what you mean by “ontological levels” before discussing them in relation to Thomson and others.

**4. Addressing Modal Realism vs. Actualism**
- You reference Lewis on counterparts and Kripke on rigid designation, but do not fully tease out the differing metaphysical commitments of their views. For some readers, spelling this out would clarify how your argument interacts with various modal metaphysics.

**5. Use of Examples**
- The Andy Egan example is helpful, but introducing it earlier or using it more systematically to illustrate your broader metaphysical point could enhance the paper.
- Similarly, the comparison to poems would be more convincing if you showed how the analogy works—or breaks down—at critical points.

**6. Concluding Discussion**
- The conclusion could do more than recapitulate your rebuttal. Consider briefly mentioning possible implications (e.g., for aesthetics, persistence through change, or the ontology of artworks) and directions for future inquiry.

## Specific Suggestions

- **Paragraph Transitions**: Sometimes your argument jumps a step (e.g., from modal to non-modal properties). Use topic sentences to guide readers.
- **Footnote Placement**: Some footnotes address side issues that might be worth engaging in the main text, as they seem pertinent (e.g., formula for weighing intersecting objects).
- **Reference Consistency**: Double-check citation styles (e.g., Kit Fine, Kripke, Lewis; occasionally page numbers or full publication info are missing).

## Final Thoughts

This is an impressively nuanced essay on a difficult topic. With greater clarity around the nature of the “one-thinger” thesis, more systematic engagement with objections, and fuller definitions of key philosophical terms, your argument would be even stronger. Keep focusing on explicitness and systematic structure in presenting and defending your main thesis, and your philosophical writing will continue to improve.

**Recommendation:** This paper is strong, and with minor revisions could be excellent. You should feel confident in your understanding of the topic and the depth of your philosophical analysis.
