Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your “Development Paper” based on content, structure, use of theory, analysis, and clarity. Your overall approach demonstrates strong understanding of developmental theory and reflection on classroom observations.

---

**Strengths:**

**1. Application of Developmental Theory**
- You skillfully explain Piaget’s **Theory of Cognitive Development** and **Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Reasoning** in relation to actual students.
- The distinction between **formal operations** and earlier stages is clear, and you accurately tie it to classroom activities.
- You show real insight in analyzing why certain behavior management techniques may not work for older students, even when they did at younger ages.

**2. Classroom Context and Observation**
- The specific examples from Willow Run High School (lesson routines, quiz questions, classroom behavior) effectively ground your theoretical analysis in reality.
- The contrast between the two classes (honors 11th grade vs. “regular” 12th grade) is useful for your argument.

**3. Critical Reflection**
- You question the **appropriateness of instructional practices** for the students’ developmental stage and offer thoughtful suggestions for improvement (e.g., class discussions, journal responses).
- The connection you draw between **cognitive** and **moral** development is insightful.

**4. Use of Evidence**
- You reference actual events and responses (like ACT prep essays and reactions to Shoeless Joe and The Color Purple).

**Areas for Improvement & Suggestions:**

**A. Organization and Flow**
- **Intro/Thesis**: Give a clearer thesis or purpose statement in your introduction. The paper launches into the theory quickly; setting the context (“This paper evaluates how developmental theory applies to my classroom placement, examining both cognitive and moral development in relation to instructional practices…”) would clarify your aim for the reader.
- **Paragraph Structure**: Some paragraphs are very long and cover several points at once. Consider breaking them up for readability (especially when switching from discussion of Piaget to Kohlberg, or from description to analysis).
- **Transitions**: Make transitions smoother between theory, observation, and analysis. Explicitly signal when you’re moving from observation (“In the classroom…”) to interpretation (“According to Piaget…”).

**B. Depth of Analysis**
- While you apply theories well, at times the analysis could go deeper:
   - Provide more examples (even hypothetical ones) of **developmentally appropriate alternatives** to current practices.
   - When discussing student misbehavior, consider more classroom management theories or other external factors (e.g., student motivation, classroom culture).

**C. Use of Literature**
- It would strengthen the paper if you briefly referenced specific works by Piaget and Kohlberg (even if just parenthetically), or cited other research or best practices in secondary ELA instruction.

**D. Clarity and Conciseness**
- Some sentences are wordy or repetitive (e.g., “Because of this advanced stage of cognitive development, it would be possible for students to more easily find broad themes, ‘big ideas,’ and applications to their own lives…”). Aim for more concise, direct language.
- There are a few minor typos (“man students” should be “many students”; “theses student’s educational” should be “these students’ educational”), and a few awkward phrasings (“this instructor has thought some of his students” instead of “taught”).

**E. Conclusion**
- The final paragraph is promising but would be stronger if you synthesized your main points about theory-practice alignment and made a clear recommendation for future instructional practices.

**Summary of Feedback (Quick Bullets):**
- **+ Thoughtful use of Piaget and Kohlberg; strong classroom observation.**
- **+ Effective critique of current instructional fit for student development.**
- **÷ Needs a sharper thesis/intro and organizational improvements.**
- **÷ Expand analysis with more alternatives and reference to literature.**
- **÷ Improve paragraph structure, conciseness, and check for minor errors.**
- **÷ Strengthen conclusion with clear recommendations.**

**Overall:**  
This is a well-observed, theory-informed paper that demonstrates thoughtful analysis and a good grasp of developmental psychology’s classroom implications. With more polish on organization, writing mechanics, and critical depth, it would be even stronger.
