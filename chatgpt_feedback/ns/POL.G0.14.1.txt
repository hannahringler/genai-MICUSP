Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, “The Electoral Micro-Macroeconomic Cycle: Taking Tufte to the State Level.” I’ve organized the feedback into key areas: **Argument & Structure, Evidence & Literature Review, Writing Style, Methodology, and Suggestions for Improvement.** 

---

## **Argument & Structure**
**Strengths:**
- The argument is clear: you extend Tufte’s political business cycle theory from the national level to American state (gubernatorial) elections.
- The paper moves logically from theoretical background, to literature review, to empirical application and methodology, and finally to a conclusion tying everything together.
- Good use of an anecdotal example (Michigan’s minimum wage) to ground the discussion.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The introduction could benefit from a clearer thesis statement. Currently, the thesis is implied more than outright stated. Consider explicitly stating your main hypothesis by the end of the introduction.
- Some sections are a little repetitive (e.g., restating Tufte’s assumptions multiple times). Try to synthesize rather than re-explain in each section.
- The conclusion could be slightly stronger by revisiting the stakes or importance of this research beyond “it strengthens Tufte’s argument.”

## **Evidence & Literature Review**
**Strengths:**
- You review relevant and key works, including Tufte, Hibbs, and newer studies, showing strong familiarity with the political business cycle literature.
- You explain the differences between the “political business cycle” model and the “partisan” theory well.
- Good use of comparative (Canadian provinces, EU countries) examples to bolster your case for generalizability.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The literature review is comprehensive, but at times it reads a bit like a list of studies. Consider weaving the studies together more analytically: what are the points of agreement/disagreement? Any open debates?
- It’s not always clear which conclusions are based on prior research and which are your own conjectures (e.g., “It is my conjecture that other governors engage…”). Try to clearly distinguish between established findings and your own hypotheses.

## **Writing Style**
**Strengths:**
- The writing demonstrates strong engagement with the material and an ability to explain complex concepts accessibly.
- Use of quotations and references is appropriate and well-integrated.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Occasional awkward sentence constructions (e.g., “If rational (meaning the benefits of keeping the job are greater than the costs), the incumbent would prefer to keep his or her job.”). Sometimes wording is convoluted; revise for clarity and conciseness.
- There are a few typos and instances of missing or incorrect words; a careful proofread would help.
- Some run-on sentences/paragraphs could be broken up for easier reading.

## **Methodology**
**Strengths:**
- You think clearly about how to empirically test the theory, proposing the use of changes in real disposable income and outlining a regression approach.
- Good awareness of possible confounders (national economy, synced elections, partisan control of legislatures).

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The empirical strategy is described hypothetically—a natural limitation of the assignment, but you could outline in more detail **how** data would be collected (what sources, what time periods, variable operationalization, types of controls).
- Consider addressing additional outcome variables that governors might influence (e.g., unemployment, state GDP, public spending projects)—not just disposable income.
- A table or flowchart, even briefly described, could help the reader visualize your proposed research design.

## **Suggestions for Improvement & Next Steps**
- **Sharpen the Thesis**: End the introduction with a concise hypothesis: "I hypothesize that, similar to Tufte’s findings at the national level, state governors engage in economic manipulation to boost their reelection chances, as evidenced by pre-election increases in real disposable income.”
- **Integrate Literature Analytically**: Comment more explicitly on how past literature informs your approach; consider counter-arguments or cases where the model does not hold.
- **Be Specific about methods**: Even though you’re not conducting empirical work, be as precise as possible about what you would do and why.
- **Editing**: Proofread for grammar, clarity, and flow.
- **Conclusion**: Close by highlighting why your study matters for scholars and practitioners—what are the policy implications or broader lessons?

## **Overall Assessment**
This is a well-structured, thoughtful, and well-researched proposal. With stronger integration of literature, a clearer thesis, and tighter prose, it would be an excellent undergraduate research paper.
