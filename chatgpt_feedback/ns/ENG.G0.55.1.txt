Absolutely! Here’s a comprehensive feedback breakdown on your paper, “Self Destruction in Kindred.” 

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Focused Thesis**
You present a thoughtful central argument, linking self-destruction and mutilation to broader themes of interconnection, racism, and historical trauma in *Kindred*. The focus on how Dana, Rufus, and Alice embody these ideas is strong and consistent throughout.

### 2. **Textual Evidence**
You effectively cite and analyze quotations from *Kindred*, demonstrating a close reading of the novel. Each point is well-supported with references to the text.

### 3. **Thematic Depth**
You do well to connect individual acts of self-destruction to societal and historical implications, pushing your analysis beyond the surface. The connection to the 0.03% human difference introduces an original and universal lens.

### 4. **Structure and Organization**
The essay follows a logical structure: you introduce your thesis, then work through each character, and finally tie their experiences together before concluding. This helps the reader follow your argument.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Thesis Clarity**
The thesis, though thoughtful, is somewhat buried and complex in the introduction. Try distilling your primary argument into a clear, single-sentence thesis at the end of your introduction. For example:  
*“In Kindred, Octavia Butler uses physical and emotional self-destruction among Dana, Rufus, and Alice to symbolize the cyclical harm of racism, demonstrating that harming others is ultimately self-harming, both for individuals and society as a whole.”*

### 2. **Transitions and Flow**
Some sections—especially when moving from Dana’s perspective to Rufus or Alice—feel a bit abrupt. Use clearer topic sentences and transition phrases to guide the reader through your analysis.

### 3. **Depth of Characterization**
You effectively outline Dana’s and Rufus’s destructive ties, but Alice’s section could use more detail. Expand on Alice’s motivations and emotional state. How does her suicide reflect her complex relationship with Rufus and with the institution of slavery?

### 4. **Summary vs. Analysis**
At times, the essay slips into summarizing events rather than analyzing their significance (e.g., recounting a scene before explaining its thematic meaning). Prioritize analysis; after mentioning a plot event, immediately connect it to your thesis.

### 5. **Societal Implications**
You make the fascinating argument that self-harm among characters represents societal self-harm caused by racism. Consider pushing this point further, perhaps exploring its relevance in the present day or integrating a brief scholarly source to strengthen this insight (beyond Kottak’s genetics point).

### 6. **Clarity and Conciseness**
Some sentences are long and could be clearer. For example:  
“By killing Rufus, her ancestor, Dana has lost him as well as her connection to him.”  
Try: *“When Dana kills Rufus, she loses both her ancestor and her connection to her past.”*  
Tightening sentences will strengthen your argument.

## Minor Suggestions

- **Quotations**: Integrate quotations smoothly into your own sentences rather than presenting them as stand-alone blocks when possible.
- **Proofreading**: There are occasional typos (“hat” instead of “that,” etc.). Make sure to do one last read-through.
- **Citations**: Great job providing citations both in-text and at the end.

## Conclusion

This is a strong, thoughtful essay that engages deeply with Butler’s novel and raises important points about self-destruction, agency, and interconnection. With a clearer thesis, smoother transitions, and a slightly tighter focus on analysis over summary, your already compelling argument will be even more effective.

**Overall: B+/A-**
