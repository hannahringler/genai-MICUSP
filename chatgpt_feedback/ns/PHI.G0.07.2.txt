Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback analysis of your argumentative philosophy essay on the Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE) and intuitions about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Focus and Scope**  
   You identify a sharp philosophical problem: the apparent inconsistency between popular moral intuitions about terror bombing generally (considered wrong) and about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (often seen as justified). You use DDE as your main conceptual lens, which gives the essay strong focus.

2. **Engagement with Primary Sources**  
   You reference and engage with prominent philosophers (Foot, Thomson, Quinn) and demonstrate good understanding of their revisions to DDE. The discussion about negative versus positive rights, opportunistic versus eliminative agency, etc., shows solid grasp of the material.

3. **Logical Structure**  
   The essay is well-organized. Each section builds on the last:  
   - Exposition of DDE and related arguments  
   - Illustration of the challenge posed by Hiroshima/Nagasaki  
   - Analysis of possible attempts to draw distinctions or justify exceptions  
   - Reflection on the psychological/social reasons for exceptionalist intuition

4. **Honest and Nuanced Conclusion**  
   You resist oversimplification in your conclusion. Instead of claiming a clear victory for or against DDE, you suggest that our intuitions in the Hiroshima/Nagasaki case are shaped by extra-moral factors (nationalism, self-interest, etc.), and that this should make us wary of relying too heavily on them without critical examination.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Thesis Statement**  
   The central thesis could be made clearer earlier on. You state your aim, but the precise claim (that intuitions excusing Hiroshima are driven by morally irrelevant factors, not an exception within DDE itself) takes time to emerge. Consider sharpening this in the introduction:  
   *“I argue that DDE, properly applied, condemns Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and our inclination to excuse those acts is rooted more in bias and self-interest than moral principle.”*

2. **Clarification and Conciseness**  
   Some sentences are a bit wordy or circuitous, which slightly muddies your main points. Example:  
   > "But to do this one would have to suppose that DDE claims to offer a single principle, which guides our intuitions in every relevant case. All three philosophers deny this."  
   This is a subtle, important point—consider making it punchier:  
   *“However, DDE and its main defenders do not pretend to capture all moral intuitions with a single principle; even so, the Hiroshima case demands serious critical attention…”*

3. **Counterarguments**  
   While you consider some possible distinctions (e.g., “just war,” duty to country), you might strengthen your paper by more deeply engaging with specific counterarguments from proponents of Truman’s decision (e.g., the argument that “total war” fundamentally alters moral calculus, or that Japanese government culpability altered civilian status). Even the potential DDE-style arguments that foresee-but-do-not-intend civilian deaths could be engaged in more detail.

4. **Philosophical Depth**  
   Your conclusion about moral reasoning being swayed by self-interest is powerful, but could go further. For example, you might briefly mention empirical research (moral psychology, bias), or philosophical critiques (relativism, cultural chauvinism), to underline your diagnosis and show wider engagement.

5. **Citation and Formatting**  
   There are some informal references to page numbers and authors, but more conventional citation (author, year, page) could improve clarity. A short works cited or footnotes section could further strengthen the scholarly character (unless your assignment asked for an informal referencing style).

6. **Examples**  
   You might use a quick summary of one or two more classic trolley-style dilemmas (or contrast with another wartime moral dilemma) to highlight the “universality” you argue morality needs.

**Summary Statement:**  
This is a thoughtful, well-structured, and insightful paper. You demonstrate a solid grasp of DDE and articulately raise the challenge that Hiroshima and Nagasaki pose for moral theory and intuition. Your central insight—that our intuitions about Hiroshima/Nagasaki are colored by extra-moral factors, and that this reveals the limits of intuition as a moral guide—is persuasively developed. With a clearer thesis statement, tighter writing, deeper counterargument engagement, and some formal polish, this would be outstanding undergraduate work.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Clarify thesis early.
- Edit for conciseness.
- Briefly expand your engagement with pro-bombing arguments.
- Add formal citations if required.
