Absolutely! Here's a detailed feedback assessment of your paper **"Autonomy: Fact or Fiction"** (analyzing autonomy and faith in *Robinson Crusoe*), considering thesis, organization, use of evidence, analytical depth, writing style, and some areas for improvement:

---

## Overall Evaluation

### Thesis and Argument
Your thesis is clear and sophisticated: you argue that the myth of autonomy in Western society, as illustrated through *Robinson Crusoe*, is ultimately unsustainable in a multi-person society. You insightfully explore the tension between autonomy/self-reliance and faith, then connect these ideas to broader historical and economic contexts (capitalism and asceticism). This is an ambitious and thoughtful approach.

**Strengths:**
- Your introduction situates the discussion historically and guides the reader directly into your main argument.
- You consistently link the fictional narrative of Crusoe to real-world social myths and economic theories.

**Suggestions:**
- Your thesis can be more explicit and concise at the end of your introduction to help the reader quickly grasp your stance and what you’ll be arguing. For example: *“By examining Crusoe’s experience, it becomes clear that the myth of autonomy, though alluring, ultimately collapses in any society dependent on social and economic interdependence.”*

### Organization and Coherence

Your essay is logically organized, moving from historical context to literary analysis, then to theoretical discussion and finally to your conclusion.

**Strengths:**
- Paragraphs transition well, each addressing a specific aspect (pride vs. humility, self-reliance vs. gratitude, etc.).
- Each major point is illustrated with well-chosen quotations, followed by analysis.

**Suggestions:**
- At times, transitions between the close reading of *Robinson Crusoe* and the broader theoretical/historical arguments could be a bit smoother. Try adding “signposts” or transition sentences that clarify the connection you’re making.
- Some points, particularly in the longer paragraphs, could be broken up for easier reading and clearer focus.

---

### Use of Evidence and Textual Analysis

**Strengths:**
- You support your analysis with relevant textual evidence from *Robinson Crusoe* and theoretical support (Marx, Watt).
- The balance between quotation and analysis is generally good—you don’t just insert quotes, you explain their significance.

**Suggestions:**
- When using lengthy quotations, make sure to keep your analysis closely tied to the quoted material. For instance, following a quote, explicitly state how it supports your current argument.
- You could engage with counterarguments more directly, e.g., is there a reading of Crusoe’s faith that’s not merely perfunctory?

---

### Analytical Depth

**Strengths:**
- You engage with major philosophical debates (autonomy vs. faith, capitalism and asceticism) at a high level.
- The Marx and Watt references are deployed effectively and show engagement beyond surface-level readings.

**Suggestions:**
- The connection between capitalism, asceticism, and autonomy is strong, but a bit more explanation of *how* Crusoe’s experience translates or fails to translate to collective society would help, especially for readers less familiar with Marxist theory.
- Consider briefly referencing modern examples or implications (even just one sentence) to reinforce why this myth remains relevant.

---

### Writing Style and Mechanics

**Strengths:**
- Your prose is generally clear, formal, and appropriate for academic writing.
- Occasional rhetorical flourish and sentence variety keep the essay engaging.

**Suggestions:**
- Some sentences are quite long and may benefit from being broken up for clarity.
- Watch for minor grammar glitches (e.g., “hard work alone that gives him this unimaginable wealth in a place where money has no value and the only other people are cannibals”—you could clarify or rephrase to avoid unintentionally problematic phrasing).

---

### Conclusion

**Strengths:**
- You neatly tie up your arguments and reiterate the limitations of autonomy as a social myth.
- Your final observation—that in the end, neither faith nor autonomy “wins”—is a thought-provoking takeaway.

**Suggestions:**
- The last sentences could offer a broader reflection or implication for today’s society or contemporary understandings of autonomy, in order to give your conclusion more impact.

---

## Summary

**This is a strong, well-researched, and engaging essay.** You demonstrate critical thinking, strong engagement with primary and secondary texts, and a clear argumentative focus. With some small tweaks for clarity, organization, and deeper engagement with counterpoints or implications, this paper would be excellent for an upper-level undergraduate class.

**Final Tips:**
- Be explicit in your thesis.
- Break up longer paragraphs.
- Connect your quotations and analysis more tightly.
- Consider modern relevance in your conclusion.
