## **Feedback on Case Study 3: Molding Temperature Analysis for Liquid Rubber Supplier**

### **Strengths**

#### 1. **Clear Structure and Use of DMAIC Framework**
- The report follows the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology from Six Sigma, providing a logical and clear flow.
- Sections are clearly labeled, making it easy to follow the investigation and recommendations.

#### 2. **Problem Definition**
- The introduction concisely explains the customer complaint, economic impact, and company response.
- Quantifies the problem: $114,000 cost per customer annually, which is compelling and establishes urgency.

#### 3. **Data-Driven Analysis**
- Appropriate use of tools such as Pareto diagrams, capability analysis, and regression.
- Quantifies findings throughout (e.g., “CIR defects account for 89% of output variable defects”).
- The root cause analysis (regression) is well-executed and logical, using p-values and discussing R-squared values.

#### 4. **Effective Use of Visuals**
- The P-Diagram, Pareto Charts, Boxplots, and Control Charts are all relevant and well-integrated into the argument.
- Helps visualize the main points, especially the effect of different suppliers.

#### 5. **Clear Recommendations**
- Well-defined improvement actions: switching to Supplier B and setting a tighter catalyst % spec.
- Quantifies the expected improvement in DPM (defects per million), and links this to estimated savings.

#### 6. **Practical Considerations**
- Acknowledges potential risks related to single sourcing.
- Suggests statistical process control procedures moving forward.

### **Opportunities for Improvement**

#### 1. **Depth of Analysis**
- The analysis eliminates other potential variables early due to the regression output. However, it may be valuable to discuss any possible limitations (e.g., what if there is an interaction effect not tested?).
- No explicit mention of validating model assumptions for regression (normality, residuals, etc.), which could be briefly noted, even if only to say they were checked.

#### 2. **Discussion of Special Cause Variation**
- The control chart indicated a “special cause” due to a late spike. While noted, further recommendations for investigating or addressing this are missing. Even if suspected as data error or outlier, a brief follow-up (“Further investigation is needed…” or “Reviewed for data entry errors but not found”) would be useful.

#### 3. **Customer Impact & Broader Implications**
- Primarily quantifies cost/savings but might also discuss non-monetary benefits (customer satisfaction, reputation).
- Brief note on implementation timeline, or change management (how the switch to one supplier will be managed operationally) would enhance practical value.

#### 4. **Formatting and Writing**
- Try to avoid abrupt section breaks (e.g., in the “Analyze” section, flow is interrupted by captions and graphs). Consider summarizing the graph findings in the text for better integration.
- Some sentences in later sections are dense. Minor rewording to break these up would improve readability.

#### 5. **References**
- You make good use of figures, but in a real-world setting or for publication, cite statistical tools/software (e.g., Minitab) more formally.
- If external sources or Six Sigma literature were consulted, a short bibliography or reference list would be expected.

### **Overall Impression**

This is an excellent case study: focused, analytical, and practical. The writer demonstrates mastery of Six Sigma tools and techniques and provides both analytical depth and business relevance. Recommendations are clear and actionable, and the process is well-documented with visuals.

**Suggestions for future reports:**
- Briefly discuss limitations/risks of recommended actions (not only cost but also, for instance, supply-chain risk).
- Address any process anomalies found in control charts more thoroughly.
- Consider next steps for implementation and monitoring in the “Control” phase.

#### **Score: 19/20**
*Minus one point for not addressing the special cause in more detail and missing a small discussion on implementation practicalities. Otherwise, outstanding work!*
