Absolutely! Here’s some feedback on your paper, broken down into **Strengths**, **Areas for Improvement**, and **Suggestions** for future writing. (If you want specific comments on individual paragraphs or a more detailed line edit, just say so!)

## Strengths

**1. Clear Structure:**  
You introduce your three main sources conceptually, describe their arguments, and then directly compare and contrast them before offering your own analysis. This is well-organized and easy to follow.

**2. Comprehensive Summaries:**  
Your synopses of Slomanson, Donnelly, and Hathaway are succinct yet detailed. You highlight not just their arguments, but also the underlying logic and the evidence they use.

**3. Comparative Analysis:**  
You do a nice job identifying the interconnected nature of their debates (e.g., the normative vs. instrumentalist views of international law), showing a strong grasp of similarities and differences.

**4. Critical Engagement:**  
Rather than just summarizing, you add your own voice, especially in the “How I See It” section. You clarify why you found Hathaway’s arguments especially compelling and reflect thoughtfully on the broader theme.

**5. Use of Evidence:**  
You leverage evidence and quotes from the authors effectively, supporting key points. Specific examples (e.g., the Convention Against Torture, African/Asian perspectives) ground your arguments.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Citations/Footnotes Formatting:**  
The footnotes are listed with numbers in the text (1, 2, etc.), but it appears the actual references are not fully attributed. Make sure to clarify these or use a consistent citation style throughout (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).

**2. Engagement with Counterarguments:**  
You do discuss critiques (like the Western-centric critique of UHR), but you could strengthen your own section by directly addressing more potential counterarguments to your preferred position (e.g., are there any compelling reasons to privilege the normative approach over the instrumentalist, or vice versa?).

**3. Thematic Transition:**  
While each summary is clear, the transitions between them are a bit abrupt. A few sentences at the end of each section explicitly connecting one argument to the next would enhance flow.

**4. Depth in Personal Analysis:**  
Your final section is reflective, but it could be even more analytical. Push your own argument a bit further: What do you think is the most important obstacle to universal human rights enforcement, based on your reading? How might the authors respond to each other? Where do you see the debate evolving next?

**5. Typos and Minor Grammar Issues:**  
There are occasional minor issues (e.g., “the law still growing” should be “the law is still growing”; “a underlying ideology” should be “an underlying ideology”). A careful proofread would catch these.

**6. Title and Introduction:**  
A more specific, crafted introduction would give your paper more impact. You might begin with a strong opening about the stakes of the universal human rights debate, or a compelling real-world example.

## Suggestions

- Consider adding a brief paragraph at the start laying out the structure of your essay (road map for the reader).
- When you introduce quotations, try to frame them more explicitly: what claim or point does this quote support?
- In your comparative section, you might create a summary table or diagram showing where the three authors overlap and where they diverge (if allowed/formats permit).
- Don’t be afraid to take a slightly bolder stance in the conclusion—what do you see as the future of human rights advocacy and law, given the strengths and limits identified?
- If your assignment permits, weave in a concrete case study (beyond what’s in the readings) to illustrate your critique.

## Overall Impression

This is a well-researched, well-structured, and thoughtful undergraduate essay. Your understanding of the readings is strong, and your analysis is insightful. With some stronger transitions, a more analytical conclusion, and a little polishing of citations/grammar, this would be an excellent submission.
