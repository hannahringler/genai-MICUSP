**Overall Feedback**

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Structure & Organization:**  
   The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from the introduction, through historical analysis, to a nuanced discussion of post-1990 developments and a thoughtful conclusion. Subheadings such as “Colonial Roots of Space, Class, and Party” and “Evolution of Space after 1990” help guide the reader and demonstrate an understanding of how to structure a long essay.

2. **Engagement with Scholarship:**  
   You draw effectively on Anderson and Dodd’s work to frame and support your argument, integrating quotations and references that showcase both understanding and critical engagement. Your use of other scholars (e.g., Luis Serra, Gary Ruchwarger) adds credibility and context.

3. **Analytical Depth:**  
   The paper doesn’t just summarize events; it ties historical details to theoretical concepts (inclusivity, contestation, Dahl’s prerequisites) and uses these to interpret Nicaragua’s democratization process. This shows critical thinking and comprehension of political science theory.

4. **Insightful Thesis:**  
   Your main contention—that space, class, and party acted as democratizing tools and evolved to reinforce Nicaraguan democracy, offering an alternative pathway beyond the “standard prerequisites”—is clearly articulated and convincingly argued.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Balancing Summary and Critical Analysis:**  
   At times, especially in the historical background sections, the essay leans more towards narrative summary than analytical critique or original argument. More frequent analytical “signposting” and commentary could ensure that the focus always remains on your thesis.

2. **Use of Evidence & Citation:**  
   While you effectively cite Anderson and Dodd, sometimes quotations are inserted with minimal analysis or synthesis. Make sure you always connect block quotes or key facts back to your main argument, explaining their relevance.

3. **Transitions and Flow:**  
   Some paragraphs could use stronger transitions, both at the start and end, to more explicitly tie the discussion back to the main argument. Particularly at the start of each sub-section, a road-map or linking sentence would help maintain momentum.

4. **Counterarguments & Limitations:**  
   The paper might be strengthened by engaging more explicitly with possible counterarguments or limitations to Anderson and Dodd’s framework, as well as to your own analysis (for example, brief consideration of criticisms or alternative views on democratization in similar contexts).

5. **Conclusion Needs Punch:**  
   The conclusion is clear and thorough, but could benefit from a slightly more forceful or reflective “so what?” statement—what does this case mean for democratization theory globally? Are there implications for current democratization efforts elsewhere?

**Additional Suggestions:**

- **Polish Language and Syntax:** Watch for occasional awkward phrasing or minor errors (“It is ironic that while…” could be reworded for clarity). A close read for conciseness and style would elevate your writing.
- **Define Key Terms Early:** Consider explicitly defining “space,” “class,” and “party” at the outset, as Anderson and Dodd use them, for clarity.
- **Engage More with Dahl:** Since Dahl’s concepts underpin your argument, a brief early summary of his relevant criteria would ground the analysis.

**Summary Statement**

Overall, this is a thoughtful, well-organized, and theoretically informed essay with a strong command of its sources and case material. With some tweaks to emphasize analysis over summary, tighter integration of quotations, and slightly richer engagement with broader implications and potential criticisms, it could be outstanding.
