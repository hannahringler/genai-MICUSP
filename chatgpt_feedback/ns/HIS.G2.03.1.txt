Absolutely! Here’s some feedback on your paper, focusing on strengths and suggestions for improvement:

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Strong Summary and Engagement with Sources**
   - You do an excellent job summarizing the main arguments from Springer and Breines, especially regarding the marginalization of Black women in both feminist organizing and historical writing.
   - You bring in relevant examples and quotes from the texts, demonstrating close reading and understanding.

2. **Critical Analysis**
   - The paper goes beyond summarizing; you pose critical questions (e.g., about wave theory, the treatment of Black women under slavery, and the impact of Black nationalism).
   - You connect the arguments in the books to larger debates in the field, such as the origins of Black feminism and the limitations of historical frameworks like “waves.”

3. **Insightful Questions**
   - Your rhetorical questions (such as why Black women’s suffering wasn’t foregrounded, and why Black feminist organizing was viewed as threatening) show analytical depth. 
   - This questioning opens up space for nuanced discussion and shows independent thought.

4. **Contextual Awareness**
   - You situate the readings within broader historiographical debates and movements, making your paper relevant and engaged with scholarly conversations.

5. **Organization**
   - Despite covering a lot of ground, your paragraphs each focus on a distinct aspect of the books’ arguments and implications for feminist history.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Thesis and Structure**
   - While your analysis is strong, the paper would benefit from a more explicit **thesis statement** in the introduction. What *is* the main point you want to make about the readings or the field based on your analysis?
   - Consider stating clearly in the opening paragraph how your paper will move through the material.

2. **Transitions**
   - Some paragraphs shift quickly between points (e.g., from the issue of waves, to atrocities under slavery, to questions about masculinity and nationalism). Smoother transitions would help the reader follow your argument more easily.

3. **Engagement with Breines**
   - Springer’s work receives more attention. If the assignment is to discuss both Springer and Breines, try to balance the analysis by making clearer connections to Breines’s arguments or case studies.

4. **Depth on Certain Points**
   - When raising rhetorical questions (such as “Why was there no call during Black Power for men to discuss how badly slavery had brutalized black women as well?”), you might take one or two and develop them further, rather than moving on so quickly. 
   - Consider including more evidence or interpretation from the readings or scholarship to answer your own critical questions.

5. **Conclusion**
   - The paper ends on a strong, open question, but a brief concluding statement tying together the main arguments and their significance would give readers a sense of closure.

6. **Minor Stylistic Points**
   - Phrases like “After reading these books together with the articles...” could be more formal (e.g., “In conjunction with the articles on women in the Black Power movement…”).
   - Proofread for clarity: one or two sentences are a bit long or could be rewritten for conciseness.

### **Summary**

Overall, this is a thoughtful and well-organized response that demonstrates a deep engagement with the readings and wider scholarly conversations. With a more focused thesis, clearer transitions, and a stronger conclusion, the analysis would be even more compelling. Your questioning approach and attention to historiographical debates are major strengths—don’t be afraid to push those further!

**Great work!** If you’d like specific suggestions for revision or examples of how to rewrite certain parts, just let me know!
