Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback and analysis on your essay, “Seeing Selves in Troilus and Cressida.” I’ll address the **strengths**, **potential areas for improvement**, and **some suggestions for further revision**.

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Intellectual Ambition and Originality**
- The paper has a sophisticated thesis, blending literary analysis with early modern theories of vision and the humoral body.
- Your use of primary theoretical sources (Ficino, du Laurens, etc.) alongside literary criticism (Charnes, Paster, Roach, etc.) is impressive and demonstrates wide reading and intellectual independence.

### 2. **Clear Structure and Organization**
- The essay is well-organized, with signposted sections that move logically from historical context to textual analysis and then to meta-theatrical implications.
- Each section builds on the prior argument and helps the reader follow a complex theoretical trajectory.

### 3. **Close Reading and Engagement with the Text**
- Your readings of Achilles, Ulysses, Cressida, and Thersites are insightful, nuanced, and well supported by textual evidence.
- The analysis of Cressida, in particular, is strong, providing meaningful discussion about gender, spectatorship, and interiority.

### 4. **Theoretical Integration**
- The integration of humoral theory into the discussion of early modern embodiment and performance is effective. You make a convincing case for how theories of vision inform selfhood in the play.
- The dialogue between medical/philosophical texts and Shakespeare is handled with care.

### 5. **Meta-theatrical Sensibility**
- The move to see spectatorship in the play as a model for the audience’s own relationship to performance is well made and sophisticated.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Depth vs. Breadth**
- While the theoretical sweep is impressive, some sections move quickly—especially the summaries of Ficino and du Laurens. Consider if a *little less breadth* and more *close engagement* with each theorist might make the links more vivid.
- For instance, when reconstructing Ficino’s argument about “rays” and spirits, try to relate this more directly and consistently back to particular scenes or characters.

### 2. **Clarity and Accessibility**
- The essay sometimes assumes a high level of reader familiarity with theoretical frameworks and terminology (e.g., humoral body, subjectivity vs. identity, etc.). Occasional, concise definitions and signposts will make your argument clearer to a broader audience.
- Occasionally, sentences are syntactically complex to the point of being difficult to follow. For example, “My reading, however, resists such characterization...” could be streamlined.

### 3. **Argument Development**
- While you do take positions on many scholarly debates (especially around Cressida’s subjectivity), the paper could do more to *explicitly* stake out its own critical intervention. Your thesis would be stronger if you summed up, near the introduction or conclusion, precisely what is at stake for readers of *Troilus and Cressida* in viewing it through your lens. Is your claim that Shakespeare’s play *critiques* the humoral/visionary model, or does it *re-stage* it to new ends?
- Sometimes opposing or alternative readings are implied without being directly acknowledged, which can make it seem as though you are unaware of them. Briefly, but directly, noting counter-arguments would strengthen your analysis.

### 4. **Meta-theatrical Claims**
- The discussion of the play’s performance conditions and the audience’s possible self-reflexivity is very promising, but could be more explicitly tied to your close reading. For example, what new understanding do we, as modern audiences, gain from the play’s engagement with sight and the body, in your view?

### 5. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion is solid but could be expanded to stress your original findings, perhaps returning more forcefully to the initial questions of value, selfhood, and spectatorship. Consider ending by reflecting on what reading *Troilus and Cressida* this way adds to, or changes about, our understanding of early modern drama and/or subjectivity.

## **Suggestions for Revision**

- **Clarify and foreground your thesis** earlier. Consider a summary paragraph at the end of your introduction that encapsulates your critical intervention.
- **Define technical or theoretical terms** the first time they appear (“humoral,” “interiority,” etc.).
- **Integrate theoretical and textual analysis more closely.** Rather than summarizing Ficino/du Laurens in one block and the play in another, weave them together where possible.
- **Address opposing views** or anticipated objections explicitly to sharpen your argument.
- **Refine sentence-level clarity**—look for overly complex constructions and try paring them down.
- **Highlight the stakes** of your argument for the broader field of Shakespeare studies/performance theory.

## **Final Assessment**

This is a strong, resourceful, and thought-provoking essay that does excellent work both in close reading and theoretical engagement. With some careful revisions for clarity and focus, it could be an outstanding seminar or journal paper.
