## Overall Impression
This paper is a well-structured and insightful examination of organizational culture using Petersen Motor Company as a case study. It leverages theoretical frameworks from key scholars (Schein and Morgan) and applies them in a practical context. The writing demonstrates strong observational and analytical skills, making use of both insider and outsider perspectives.

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Structure and Organization**
- The paper is organized into logical sections: introduction, observations, analytic frameworks, and conclusion.
- Subsections (such as Financial Policy, Perceptions and Interactions, Problem Management, and Gender Roles) neatly guide the reader through distinct cultural dimensions.

### 2. **Theoretical Grounding**
- Effective use of Schein and Morgan’s work lends academic rigor.
- The application of Schein’s four dimensions of cultural analysis shows a good understanding of theory in practice.

### 3. **Insightful Observations**
- Real-world details (commission-based pay, departmental divides, gender roles, and management styles) illustrate cultural attributes vividly.
- Examples such as “Snap-On Girl Calendars” and anecdotes about service manager dress codes reinforce points with specificity.

### 4. **Balanced Perspective**
- The paper acknowledges both positive and negative aspects of the dealership culture, rather than presenting a one-sided view.

### 5. **Practical Implications**
- The discussion of the assimilation into a dealership chain and its potential effects on organizational culture provides a strong real-world connection.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **More In-depth Analysis of Negative Impacts**
- At times, the paper glosses over negative cultural implications (e.g., “commission pay can breed selfishness, jealousy, defensiveness, and secrecy”), but these could use more detailed analysis. For example, how do these behaviors affect teamwork or customer satisfaction specifically?

### 2. **Expansion of Evidence Base**
- While the report is based in part on personal experience, only one dealership is discussed in depth. Brief comparisons to other dealerships or data from external sources (even anecdotal) would help substantiate claims of uniformity in US dealership culture.

### 3. **Limited Discussion of Counterpoints**
- The conclusion touches on culture inhibiting customer delight/employee fulfillment, but more explicit discussion throughout the paper of attempted culture shifts or counter-cultures would nuance the analysis.

### 4. **Gender Roles**
- The section on gender roles observes but does not critique or analyze the effects of these norms. What are the implications for talent recruitment, retention, or workplace morale? Are there signs of change?

### 5. **Writing Style & Flow**
- Some sentences are long and could be condensed for clarity. For example, “This behavior is reinforced when individuals in the same office use the same strings” could be rewritten as “This behavior is reinforced by colleagues imitating one another.”
- There are minor typographical errors (e.g., misplaced characters like “considerable,” “inuences”—this appears to be an artifact of text conversion, but should be corrected in formal submissions).

### 6. **Citation and Reference Formatting**
- References are present but could be formatted more consistently (e.g., missing page numbers, inconsistent order/placement).

## Suggestions for Improvement

- **Further Theoretical Integration:** Consider briefly introducing Schein and Morgan’s theories in the introduction to provide context for their later application.
- **Richness of Examples:** Add a few brief vignettes or quotes from employees (even anonymously or from existing literature) to enrich analysis.
- **Discussion of Change Efforts:** Describe any initiatives (if known) that PMC or similar organizations have undertaken to shift culture—what worked or didn’t, and why.
- **Implications Section:** Expand the conclusion to discuss practical recommendations or implications for dealership management looking to improve culture.
- **Proofreading:** Eliminate typographical artifacts and check for conciseness in language.

## Summary

This is a solid case study and analysis of organizational culture, successfully applying theoretical frameworks to practical observation. Deepening the analysis of identified issues, expanding the evidence base, and polishing language will elevate the paper further. Great job!
