# **Feedback on “Autumnal Imagery in Persuasion”**

## **Strengths**

### **1. Clear, Focused Thesis**
- The essay presents a strong and clearly stated central argument: that Austen’s use of autumnal imagery in *Persuasion* elevates mature love and the later stages of life, positioning them as equally (or more) fulfilling than youth.
- The thesis is well integrated into the introduction and revisited throughout the body and conclusion.

### **2. Effective Use of Textual Evidence**
- The paper does an excellent job bringing in direct quotations from *Persuasion* (e.g., “the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges”) and secondary sources (notably Virginia Woolf in *The Common Reader*), correctly cited.
- There’s consistent close reading and interpretation of these passages, linking them effectively to the argument about autumnal imagery.

### **3. Logical Organization & Coherence**
- The structure is logical, moving from establishing the theme, exploring Anne’s place between spring and autumn, to showing how this is mirrored in her emotional journey and eventual happiness.
- Transitions between points are clear, and each paragraph builds on the last.

### **4. Interpretive Depth**
- The essay shows a sophisticated understanding, not just of Austen’s novel, but also of the broader cultural meanings of seasons, maturity, and love lost/found.
- It engages with secondary criticism in a meaningful way (particularly Woolf), rather than just name-dropping.

### **5. Stylistic Control**
- The prose is clear, academically appropriate, and in many places elegant (e.g., “Her own autumnal situation seems not ‘the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges,’ poetic and sweet, but merely a solitary withered hedge, sadly standing next to a bright, blooming young bud”).

## **Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

### **1. Further Contextualization**
- While Woolf is quoted effectively, the essay might expand on why Austen (and her contemporaries) would use seasonal metaphors this way. Are there other literary or cultural reasons autumn would symbolize maturity in Austen’s context?
- Briefly referencing other Austen novels (particularly their tone and imagery) could contrast how *Persuasion* marks a shift in style and theme.

### **2. More Nuanced Counter-Argument**
- At one point, the essay notes spring “often seems pale in comparison” to autumn for Anne, but could acknowledge more fully *why* youth is so alluring and idealized in both the novel’s society and in literature, then argue more forcefully that Austen is complicating rather than simply inverting this trope.

### **3. Character Analysis Depth**
- The discussion of Louisa and Henrietta as contrasts to Anne is good, but you could push this further. How specifically do Louisa’s experiences alter her, and how does this reflect the overall seasonal motif? Is her “sobering” akin to moving from spring to autumn, or is it something else?
- Likewise, the reflections on Captain Wentworth’s development could be deepened to show how autumnal maturity benefits not just Anne but both partners.

### **4. Tightening and Transitions**
- Occasionally, the analysis feels slightly repetitive, especially when describing Anne’s “sweet and sad” nature and her position “post-bloom.” Consider trimming or fusing related points to maintain momentum.
- Some transitions could be made smoother; for instance, when moving from Anne’s feelings about autumn to the narrative focus on Louisa and spring.

### **5. Broader Thematic Implications**
- The conclusion alludes to the “fulfillment” of Anne and Wentworth’s union, but could go further in considering what Austen is saying about adult life, regret, and solace as broader human experiences.
- You might end with a brief observation on how autumnal imagery in *Persuasion* resonates with readers in different periods, or how it offers a counter-narrative to “youth equals happiness.”

## **Minor Notes**

- Ensure all citations (page numbers, secondary sources) are consistent and fully referenced per your class’s preferred style.
- There are a few minor typographical slips (e.g. the unhyphenated “overexuberance” gets split awkwardly across lines) that should be checked, though these do not impede understanding.
- The repetition of the copyright/MICUSP statement disrupts some page transitions—ensure that in your final copy for submission, you have a clean text.

# **Summary**

This is a nuanced, perceptive, and well-argued essay that demonstrates excellent analytical and writing skills. The work could be made even stronger with a bit more depth in characterization, slightly tighter structure, and by considering the broader stakes of Austen’s use of seasons as metaphor. Overall, it’s a thoughtful and compelling analysis that would likely receive high marks in an advanced undergraduate literature class.
