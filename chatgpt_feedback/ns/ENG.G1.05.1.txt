Certainly! Here is some detailed feedback on your paper, **"The Faerie Kings: Yeatsʼs Spenser"**:

---

### Strengths

**1. Depth of Research and Knowledge**
- This essay clearly demonstrates deep engagement with both Yeats and Spenser. The range of references to Yeats’s works, Spenser’s poetry, biographical materials, and scholarship is impressive.
- Your paper is well-cited, drawing on literary criticism, biographies, letters, and the poems themselves.

**2. Engagement with Complex Ideas**
- The discussion of the allegory vs. symbolism concept is nuanced and shows real understanding of Yeats’s own theoretical struggles.
- You make thoughtful connections between Yeats’s poetic evolution and the influence of Spenser, particularly in terms of landscape, allegory, and the poet’s role in society.

**3. Structure and Organization**
- The paper is clearly structured, with well-defined sections that guide the reader through different facets of Yeats’s Spenserian inheritance (e.g., Early Influences, Courtly Patronage, Otherworlds, Allegory/Symbol, Irishness).
- Topic sentences and transitions are generally strong, helping to maintain clarity in a long and detailed argument.

**4. Original Insight**
- Your readings often synthesize critical opinions with your own analysis, particularly in placing Yeats’s later poetry (like the Byzantium poems) in the context of his symbolic theory.
- The discussion of Yeats’s own Anglo-Irish predicament and his reflection on Spenser’s colonial position is particularly compelling and original.

### Areas for Revision

**1. Thesis and Argument Focus**
- While your thesis is implied and develops as you proceed, you could strengthen the essay by distilling a concise, explicit thesis statement early on. What, precisely, do you want the reader to conclude about Yeats’s relation to Spenser by the end?
- The argument sometimes reads more like a series of related insights than a single, unfolding claim. Consider synthesizing your thematic sections into a more unified argument—what is at stake, overall, in tracing Spenser’s legacy in Yeats?

**2. Paragraph Focus and Transitions**
- In some sections, paragraphs become quite long and contain multiple points that could benefit from being separated for emphasis and clarity. For example, the transition between the analysis of Yeats’s use of Spenser’s language and the landscape imagery could be sharper.
- Some paragraphs begin to summarize historical/critical background at length (e.g., on Yeats’s patronage or on the Anglo-Irish context) before returning to your main analysis; keep your focus clear and tie background more frequently back to your claim.

**3. Balance of Quotation and Analysis**
- You use quotation well overall, but some long block quotes and detailed references could be more tightly integrated with your own voice. After quoting, always make sure to explicitly state what that quote demonstrates in your argument.
- Sometimes the weight of evidence crowds out your own critical stance; strive for an 80/20 ratio—more of your own close reading, with strategic use of criticism and textual evidence in support.

**4. Conclusion**
- The conclusion restates key points but could be more assertive in answering the “so what?” question. Why does it matter that Yeats’s Spenserian inheritances are so complex? What larger relevance does this have for understanding Yeats, or for studies of literary inheritance?

**5. Minor Stylistic Notes**
- Watch for occasional lapses into passive constructions or long-winded sentences. Periodically break up longer passages into shorter sentences for impact.
- Occasional minor typographical errors or mismatched parentheticals (“see for example Chrétien de Troyes’s Cligés”), but nothing distracting.
