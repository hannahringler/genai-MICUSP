Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on your philosophy paper on the concept of omnipotence:

---

**Strengths:**

**1. Clear Structure and Organization:**  
You provide a clear roadmap for your paper at the start, outlining that you will examine two competing definitions of omnipotence. Each section flows logically into the next, and your conclusion successfully returns to the initial questions.

**2. Engagement with Philosophical Sources:**  
You cite key figures, notably Aquinas, as well as sources (Hoffman and Rosenkrantz). Your engagement with the paradox of the stone and specific quotations demonstrates a familiarity with classic arguments.

**3. Thoughtful Analysis and Reflection:**  
You do not merely summarize each position but thoughtfully consider their implications—especially the question of whether human limitations should define the parameters of what “omnipotence” means in relation to God. Your use of analogies (e.g., MRI machine) helps clarify your points.

**4. Strong grasp of Contradictions:**  
You capably lay out the logical paradoxes introduced in the first definition (such as the stone paradox and sitting/standing at the same time) and explain why these challenge our understanding of true omnipotence.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

**1. Thesis Clarity and Position:**  
While you do a good job presenting and weighing both definitions, your own position becomes somewhat ambiguous. In analytic philosophy, it's often helpful to more clearly stake a position, even if tentative, and defend it. Currently, your conclusion suggests agnosticism between definitions. If that's your stance, clarify why. If you lean towards Aquinas’ definition, say so more directly.

**2. Deeper Engagement with Objections and Counterpoints:**  
Your paper mentions the consequences of limiting God's power via logical possibility, but you could develop this consideration further. For instance:
- Some philosophers might argue that “logically impossible” things are not “things” at all, and so the restriction isn't really a limitation.
- Others, like Descartes, propose that God can do the logically impossible—how would you respond to this more radical view?

**3. Addressing Potential Confusion:**  
In some places, e.g., “make 3+7=grapefruit,” the examples are helpful, but you might clarify distinctions between semantic nonsense and logical contradiction for readers unfamiliar with philosophy.

**4. Reference Detail and Academic Tone:**  
Make sure that every reference is clear and properly formatted. For instance, you oscillate between “Coursepack” citations and author names; standardizing this would help. Also, polish occasionally informal language (e.g., “even make this paper write itself”) to maintain a formal academic tone.

**5. Conclusion:**  
Your conclusion is more of a restatement than a synthesis. Consider reflecting on the broader significance: What does this debate say about theology, faith, or the limits of human reason? Are you suggesting that these limits themselves are a key insight?

**Minor Notes:**  
- Small typos and grammar could be cleaned up in a revision (“all thins that are possible,” “to heavy,” etc.).
- There's some repeated content between paragraphs that could be streamlined for conciseness.
- The transitions between paragraphs are mostly clear, but a few connecting sentences would help to ensure smooth progression.

**Overall:**  
This is a thoughtful and well-organized undergraduate paper that demonstrates solid understanding of the topic. With clearer articulation of your own stance, deeper engagement with possible objections, and some polish to academic tone and structure, it would be even stronger.
