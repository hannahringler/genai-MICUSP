Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on the paper **“Varying infectivity of Diplostomum flexicaudum in fish species of Douglas Lake”**, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement. The feedback is organized under commonly used biology/science writing criteria.

### **Overall Impression**
This is a well-organized and generally well-written undergraduate research report. The study tackles an important ecological question about host-parasite dynamics, uses accepted methods, and presents both significant and non-significant findings transparently. The integration of previous literature is thorough and the statistical analysis is mostly appropriate.

### **Strengths**

#### 1. **Clarity and Organization**
- The paper follows the correct scientific structure: Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments, and References.
- The flow between sections is logical and easy to follow. Each section is clearly demarcated and serves its purpose.
- Use of subheadings (Results, Discussion, etc.) is effective.

#### 2. **Background/Literature Review**
- The introduction provides solid context, summarizing relevant biology, disease impact, and prior research.
- Previous work is cited to justify the rationale for the study and to formulate hypotheses.

#### 3. **Hypothesis and Rationale**
- Hypotheses are clearly stated—about which fish characteristics and locations are predicted to have higher infection levels.
- The rationale for investigating multiple host species and locations is well-supported by literature.

#### 4. **Methodological Detail**
- The methods are described with enough precision for replication.
- Sampling sites, fish species, dissection methods, and variables measured are all specified.

#### 5. **Analysis and Results**
- Appropriate use of ANOVA, regression, and t-tests.
- Distinctions are made between analyses across all species vs. only infected species.
- Results are presented honestly, including non-significant findings.

#### 6. **Discussion and Interpretation**
- Data are interpreted cautiously, and alternative explanations and study limitations are discussed.
- The discussion directly addresses the hypotheses and brings in relevant literature for broader context.

### **Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

#### 1. **Abstract Placement**
- The abstract appears at the end. **Suggestion:** Place the abstract at the beginning, as is normal in scientific writing, for easier access to the summary.

#### 2. **Sample Size and Statistical Power**
- The study is hindered by small sample sizes, especially for some species (e.g., only one pumpkinseed, three largemouth bass, etc.).
- You acknowledge this, but it weakens the statistical power and makes it hard to draw strong conclusions, particularly about species differences.
- **Suggestion:** For publication or future research, increase sample sizes, especially for species with apparent zero infections. Consider pooling data over years if possible.

#### 3. **Figures and Tables**
- Descriptions reference several figures (e.g., Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, etc.), but these are not included or described in detail in the text provided.
- **Suggestion:** Include all figures and tables, properly labeled and referenced, and refer to each at the point of discussion in the Results and Discussion.

#### 4. **Data Analysis Details**
- Some statistical details are mentioned (e.g., F-values, p-values), but the methods could use more detail for transparency:
    - What assumptions were checked for ANOVA/regression?
    - Was multiple testing correction applied?
    - How were non-normal data handled?
    - Were any data transformations used?
- **Suggestion:** Clarify these points to enhance the methodological rigor.

#### 5. **Species Identification**
- There is some ambiguity in species identification (e.g., “common shiners” Notropis cornuta—should be Notropis cornutus, “sand shiners” Notropis stramineus).
- **Suggestion:** Double-check all Latin names and common names for accuracy.

#### 6. **Discussion of Negative Results**
- The discussion on zero-prevalence species is good, but conclusions about potential resistance could be overstated with very small n (sample size).
- **Suggestion:** Acknowledge that while the results are suggestive, no firm conclusions can be drawn until much larger sample sizes are analyzed.

#### 7. **References Formatting**
- The “Literature Cited” section is clear and relevant but mixes Journal abbreviations and full names.
- **Suggestion:** Standardize citation formatting as per target journal style (probably CSE or APA for biology).

#### 8. **Stylistic and Clarity Issues**
- Watch for some awkward or overly complex sentences (e.g., “...by teasing apart the eye with dissecting prongs and carefully popping the lens.”).
- Use active voice when possible.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon and make sure every term is clear to your target audience.

#### 9. **Future Directions**
- You do mention possible extensions—e.g., snail surveys, laboratory infections, habitat comparisons.
- **Suggestion:** End with a paragraph summarizing concrete, testable follow-up studies.

### **Minor Notes**

- Line and hook method: briefly state what this is for non-specialists.
- GPS: provide example coordinates or a map (which might be in Figure 2).
- Remove repetitive copyright notifications in the report text for submission.
- Consistency: sometimes “metacercaria(e)” and sometimes “metacercariae” are used—pick one style.

## **Summary**

**This is a strong undergraduate paper, with good logic, literature grounding, methods, and honest discussion of limits. For manuscript or thesis submission, fix sample size issues, standardize figures/tables/references, and clarify stats. Add more details to methods as needed, and be careful not to overinterpret data with small n.**

**Overall Grade (if required):** A- (reflecting high quality given undergraduate level, but not publishable as-is because of sample size and omitted visuals)
