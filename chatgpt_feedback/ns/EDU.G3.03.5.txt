Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your essay “Immigration and Americanization: Then and Now”—highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.

---

## Strengths

**1. Clear Structure and Organization:**  
Your essay is logically organized, moving from an introduction of historical immigration to present-day issues. Each body paragraph focuses on specific aspects (English language, school progress, curriculum, restrictionism), making your argument easy to follow.

**2. Strong Historical Context:**  
You provide a well-chosen historical overview, using specific evidence and examples (laws, newspaper editorials, historical attitudes) to support your claims. The references to historians and primary sources add credibility.

**3. Effective Comparisons:**  
The parallel you draw between past and present is cogent. By tracing similar attitudes and educational challenges across different eras, you highlight the cyclical nature of American reactions to immigration.

**4. Use of Evidence:**  
You skillfully cite a range of scholarly sources and legislation (e.g., National Origins Act, Proposition 227, No Child Left Behind), grounding your argument in real policies and historical facts.

**5. Thoughtful Conclusion:**  
You close with an inclusive, forward-looking message—acknowledging the need for greater understanding and inclusion, making the essay feel complete.

## Areas for Improvement & Suggestions

**1. Thesis Statement:**  
While your introduction outlines the scope, your thesis could be more explicit and argumentative. For example:  
*“A comparison of educational and societal responses to immigration in the early twentieth century and today reveals that, while details have changed, underlying issues and attitudes remain remarkably similar.”*

**2. Deeper Analysis of Differences:**  
You focus primarily on similarities between the eras. To strengthen your analysis, discuss some key differences as well—such as shifting demographics, the role of technology, or changes in laws and public attitudes.

**3. More Voices from Immigrants (Present Day):**  
While you include historical voices (newspapers, teacher accounts), contemporary immigrant perspectives are less present. Consider incorporating testimony, news accounts, or research about how today’s immigrant children and families experience schooling.

**4. Clarify Some Transitions:**  
Some paragraphs (especially moving from early 20th-century issues to contemporary ones) could use transitional sentences to clarify the shift in time period and perspective.

**5. Expand on the Role of Curriculum:**  
You mention the incorporation of Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and Hispanic Heritage Month as somewhat marginal. You could briefly suggest ways curriculum reform could be more inclusive, or cite research on multicultural education’s effects.

**6. Watch for Generalizations:**  
When discussing “native” Americans or “mainstream” curriculum, be careful to specify what you mean (e.g., white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant) to avoid sweeping generalizations. Acknowledge diversity within groups, where appropriate.

**7. Style and Mechanics:**  
Generally well-written, but a few sentences could be smoothed for clarity. For instance:  
- “…retention rates higher than…” (might clarify: “had much higher dropout rates than native-born students”)  
- Consider condensing some lengthy sentences for ease of reading.

## Specific/Minor Notes

- If allowed, add more up-to-date examples (post-2010) regarding immigration debates for greater relevance.
