Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, **"Warning: Do Not Tell Your Friends That You Are A Virgin."** The feedback touches on **strengths**, **areas for improvement**, and **specific suggestions** in terms of organization, content, use of evidence, style, and overall clarity.

---

## Strengths

### 1. Relevant Sociological Application
- You do an excellent job drawing connections between the film *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* and sociological theories/concepts. The references to symbolic interactionism, the sexual natural attitude (SNA), gender norms, and sexual scripts are clear and well-applied.
- Integration of lecture content and scholarly sources (e.g., McGann, Krafft-Ebing, Weeks, Maines, Plummer) nicely situates your analysis in academic discourse.

### 2. Clear Structure and Focus
- Your paper stays tightly focused on its topic and thesis: how the film both reinforces and challenges dominant sexual/gender norms.
- Each paragraph develops a distinct, relevant point, supporting the central analysis.

### 3. Insightful Observations
- Your observations about the film’s portrayal of masculinity, public/private sexuality, and peer pressure are sharp and nuanced. You pick up on both comedic elements and their implications for understanding cultural attitudes.

## Areas for Improvement & Suggestions

### 1. **Thesis Statement & Introduction**
- **Strength**: Your introduction is engaging and contextualizes the analysis.
- **Suggestion**: The thesis could be more explicitly stated in the opening paragraph. While you hint at exploring how the film reinforces/challenges the SNA, consider clearly stating:  
  *"This paper examines how The 40-Year-Old Virgin both upholds and subverts society’s sexual natural attitude, using symbolic interactionism and related concepts to analyze key scenes."*

### 2. **Organization & Flow**
- The organization works, but transitions between points are sometimes abrupt.
- *Suggestion*: Consider stronger topic sentences for each paragraph that tie back to your thesis. Use transition sentences at the end of paragraphs to guide the reader to the next idea.

### 3. **Depth of Analysis**
- Some claims could be developed in greater detail, especially about "sexual scripts" and how they are performed or resisted by different characters.  
- The treatment of the SNA could benefit from clearer definitions up front and more concrete textual analysis/examples from the movie.

### 4. **Evidence & Examples**
- You give good examples from the film, but sometimes your analysis summarizes events instead of deeply analyzing how/why they reinforce or challenge norms.
- *Suggestion*: After describing a scene, pause to dissect its meaning: What does this say about masculinity/femininity? Why does it matter sociologically?

### 5. **Integration of Sources**
- Sources are cited throughout, but integrating them even further would strengthen your argument. For example, tie the theorists’ views more tightly to your film analysis so that the reader can see the direct application.

### 6. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion summarizes nicely but could be stronger by pointing explicitly to the broader implications of your analysis.  
- *Suggestion*: End with a thought-provoking statement or question about what this says about broader societal change, or how films like this both reflect and shape norms.

### 7. **Mechanics & Clarity**
- Overall, your writing is clear and academic. Watch out for some minor grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement in "talking about sexual experiences are") and awkward phrasings (“as not to be mistaken as homosexual…”).
- Try to avoid overly long sentences, and break up complex thoughts for readability.

## Sample Revised Excerpt

**Original:**
> During lecture on January 16th, 2008, Professor McGann illustrated the components of society’s sexual natural attitude. As a base level, this is consists of anything that we take for granted that we were taught about sexuality within our society. This includes the idea that there are only two sexes and normal is to express the gender which aligns with your sex, the idea that sex is biologically based in a natural drive, the assumption in others that they are heterosexual, and that we keep our sexuality private and to ourselves, to name a few that I will touch on. 

**Suggestion:**
> As Professor McGann explained (lecture, Jan. 16, 2008), society’s sexual natural attitude (SNA) refers to the taken-for-granted beliefs we inherit about sexuality: that there are only two sexes; that people naturally act according to their assigned gender; that sexual desire is a universal biological drive; and that sexuality is a private matter. These assumptions shape both personal interactions and broader cultural narratives, such as those found in popular films like *The 40-Year-Old Virgin*.

## Overall Assessment

**This is a strong, perceptive sociological analysis.** With clearer organization, more explicit thesis statements, and deeper analysis of evidence, it could be an excellent final-year undergraduate paper. Keep linking each point directly back to your main argument, and sharpen transitions for even greater impact.

**Grade estimate** (if relevant): Solid B+/A-
