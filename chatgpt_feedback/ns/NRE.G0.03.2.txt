Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, addressing its strengths and areas for improvement:

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Clear Structure**
- Your paper is well-organized, following a classic scientific structure: Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, and Works Cited.
- Each section logically builds on the previous one and helps the reader follow your study.

### **2. Scientific Rationale**
- You provide solid background information in your introduction, explaining why stormwater pollution is a relevant and growing issue.
- The use of both a plant and an animal organism to represent watershed flora and fauna is creative and allows for a multidimensional look at ecosystem health.

### **3. Methods**
- Your methodology is explained clearly, with enough detail for someone to potentially replicate your experiment.
- Controlled variables (temp, watering, sunlight, etc.) are specified.
- You acknowledged limitations, such as lack of replication and non-native species (broccoli).

### **4. Data Presentation**
- You use statistical analysis (regression, p-values, r-squared) properly to support your findings.
- Inclusion of figures and tables helps visualize trends.
- Reporting both significant and non-significant results is transparent and honest.

### **5. Discussion Quality**
- Your interpretation of results is thoughtful—you explain both expected and unexpected findings.
- The discussion references relevant literature to provide context (e.g., effects of phosphate/fertilizer runoff, heavy metals).

## **Areas for Improvement**

### **1. Hypotheses and Predictions**
- There’s some inconsistency between your hypotheses and the results. Originally, you hypothesized that stormwater would suppress plant growth, but it actually enhanced it (likely due to phosphate).
    - *Suggestion:* In the discussion, reflect more explicitly on why your prediction didn't hold in this context, and what this means for urban runoffs in real-world ecosystems.

### **2. Replication & Sample Size**
- You note only one replicate per condition for plants and damselflies. This weakens the statistical power and generalizability of your results.
    - *Suggestion:* Frame this more as a pilot study and explicitly address how additional replicates would have improved data reliability.

### **3. Broccoli as a Model Organism**
- Broccoli is not native to local watersheds, as you recognize. Its response may differ from indigenous species more representative of the ecosystem in question.
    - *Suggestion:* In future work or recommendations, propose to use native plants or explain possible differences expected.

### **4. Limited Pollutant Analysis**
- Only three pollutants were tested for, and with test strips—which are qualitative, not quantitative.
    - *Suggestion:* Note this limitation and recommend more comprehensive, quantitative water testing (for additional heavy metals, organic contaminants, etc.) in further studies.

### **5. Statistical Analysis**
- The damselfly data are not statistically significant, as you mention.
    - *Suggestion:* Briefly discuss what increases in replication would be needed to likely reach significance. Also, explain any biological significance, even if statistical significance was not reached.

### **6. Formatting and Style**
- There are several minor typos (“stastical,” “regresion,” “Eaching watering,” “ploted”) and some grammatical lapses.
    - *Suggestion:* Proofread carefully or use spelling/grammar tools to catch small errors.
- Some references lack proper capitalization and could be formatted more consistently.

### **7. Figures & Tables**
- In the main paper (and in-text), refer to figures and tables explicitly as you discuss the results.
- Improve figure captions to be more descriptive.

### **8. Expanded Conclusion**
- The conclusion could more powerfully restate your findings and their broader implications—for instance, how stormwater management could mitigate negative ecological impacts.

## **Summary Statement**
You did an excellent job formulating an accessible, interesting, and timely experiment that can contribute to ongoing discussions about urban water management and ecosystem health. With increased replication, expanded analysis of stormwater contents, and stronger tie-ins to local ecology, your study would be even more robust and directly actionable for stakeholders.

**Great work—keep it up!**
