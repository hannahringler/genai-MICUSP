Absolutely! This is a strong, well-argued, and thoroughly researched comparative review essay. Below you'll find feedback organized by **Strengths**, **Constructive Critique/Areas for Improvement**, and some **Suggestions for Improvement**.

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Clear Thesis and Framing**
- You clearly frame the central questions of your paper (ordinary vs. extraordinary women, interdisciplinarity, and the larger significance of black women’s performance).
- The opening quote from Ada Overton Walker is evocative and sets up the stakes of visibility and memory for black women performers.

### 2. **Comparative Depth**
- You do an excellent job situating each of the three books, identifying their arguments and methodologies.
- The summaries show a real command over the works and their intersections—especially regarding class, gender, respectability, and performance.

### 3. **Thematic Organization**
- You group your analysis by themes (agency, travel, respectability, audiences, sexuality, race, etc.) rather than giving three isolated book reviews. This makes the essay more sophisticated and readable.

### 4. **Engagement with Theory**
- You make strong use of theoretical frameworks (black feminism, performance studies, respectability politics, intersectionality, etc.).
- You’re not afraid to critique and complicate the narratives of the authors, especially around issues of class, historiography, or canonization.

### 5. **Effective Use of Evidence**
- You reference specific songs, historical moments, scholarly debates, and even archival gaps—all of which ground your arguments.

### 6. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion ties back to your broader questions and reflects on the future of the field.

## **Constructive Critique/Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Thesis Development and Signposting**
- While your thesis is implied, it would be helpful to have a more explicit statement early on about what your own intervention or argument is—instead of just summarizing the books’ questions.
- Consider adding explicit signposting to guide the reader through each analytical section.

### 2. **Author Positioning/Bias**
- While you mention that none of the authors are historians, you might interrogate what the strengths (or limitations) of their disciplinary backgrounds are, and how that impacts their method/evidence.
- Consider: Is there a disciplinary “blind spot” in any of the works?

### 3. **Handling of Primary vs. Secondary Sources**
- At times, your summaries veer toward library research report ("X said this, Y said that"). Try to insert your own voice a bit more—do you agree? What else would you add?
- If possible, bring in other scholarly voices beyond the three main authors, even briefly, to further contextualize the historiography.

### 4. **Critical Distance**
- You mention when you find Brown’s work “trying to accomplish too much at once.” Comments like this are helpful—it would be good to have a few more examples of what you found most/least convincing in each book.
- For instance, did you feel satisfied by Davis’s claims about “proto-feminism”? What would you critique about George-Graves’s focus on only one troupe?

### 5. **Clarity and Conciseness**
- The summary sections are dense and detailed—a good thing, but sometimes the reader might get lost. Consider breaking up very long paragraphs and using topic sentences to clarify shifts.
- Watch for repetition of points across paragraph transitions.

### 6. **Citations and Formatting**
- The paper is generally well-cited, but a final check for citation consistency is recommended.
- The included footnotes/references to other scholarship are excellent—make sure these are all clearly cited.

### 7. **Minor Stylistic Points**
- Be cautious about using words like "interesting" or "surprisingly," which can seem subjective or vague—let the evidence speak for itself.
- Sometimes the grammar is quite formal and even a bit convoluted. For further polish, you might tighten some sentences for conciseness and flow.

## **Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **More Explicit Argument**: Consider a thesis paragraph that clearly stakes your claim about the significance of these books together—beyond their recovery of neglected histories, what debate or new perspective do they open up?
2. **Use More Topic Sentences**: Start paragraphs with clear, guiding topic sentences, especially when moving between books or major themes.
3. **Your Analytical Voice**: Step back at the end of each major section to assess: What do we gain or lose with each author's approach? What would you like to see future scholarship address?
4. **Further Context**: A (brief) note on how these works fit into broader trends in African American or gender history (e.g., how do they relate to the work of Hazel Carby, Daphne Brooks, Farah Jasmine Griffin, etc.?) could foreground your knowledge base.
5. **Highlight Tensions**: Where do the authors disagree (implicitly or explicitly), or where do their approaches challenge or reinforce canonized histories?
6. **Grammar/Editing**: Read aloud for clarity; break up paragraphs for ease of reading.

## **Overall Evaluation**

This paper demonstrates both critical insight and comprehensive reading. With a bit more explicit argumentation, critical distance, and editorial tightening, it would be of publishable quality in a graduate seminar or even beyond. Excellent work!
