Absolutely! Below is detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on **structure, clarity, philosophical rigor, argumentation, and use of sources**. I will also offer suggestions for improvement.

## General Assessment

This paper presents a thoughtful, well-structured, and impressively researched critique of Rawls’s lexicographical priority of Fair Equality of Opportunity (FEO) over the Difference Principle (DP). The argument is clear and nuanced, and the engagement with contemporary scholarship is deep and impressive for a first-year graduate student paper. Your use of footnotes and references to substantive philosophical debates shows careful reading and understanding. 

### Strengths

1. **Clarity and Structure**  
   - The paper is well-organized, with a clear introduction that lays out the central question and previews your argumentative strategy.
   - Each section systematically addresses possible justifications for Rawls’s position, assessing their strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Philosophical Rigor**  
   - You display a strong command of Rawls’s theory and the critical literature. Your distinctions between arguments (e.g., between “natural” and “social” contingencies, or between distributive and relational justice) are sharp.
   - You accurately employ concepts like the original position, reflective equilibrium, and axiological priority.

3. **Critical Engagement**  
   - The paper critically evaluates multiple angles: metaphysical, axiological, and paradigmatic. Each is considered fairly and in detail before being either (provisionally) rejected or found promising.
   - The discussion is sophisticated, particularly when wrestling with the implications for the “untalented poor” and potential issues of instrumentalization and complaint.

4. **Use of Sources**  
   - You support your arguments with an excellent range of primary and secondary sources, often quoting or referencing them at relevant points.
   - The endnotes are particularly strong—detailed, informative, and showing deep engagement.

5. **Awareness of Empirical Questions**  
   - I appreciate your sensitivity to empirical uncertainties (e.g., about educational investment or the “good eggs” hypothesis), which is often missing in pure philosophy papers.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Length and Focus**
   - The paper is long and dense for a typical graduate course paper. Some sections (especially the footnotes) might be streamlined or their content integrated directly into the main text if particularly important.
   - At times, the discussion loses a focus on the original complaint of the least talented, digressing into technical details about FEO or related empirical hypotheses.
   - Consider a more explicit summary at the end of each major section, connecting your findings back to the motivating question.

2. **Thesis, Framing, and Roadmap**
   - While your introduction frames the issue well, you could be a bit more explicit in stating your thesis—or provisional answer—up front. That is, after surveying the options, what do you ultimately conclude (and on what basis)? This becomes clear in the conclusion, but a reader would benefit from knowing your position early.
   - Similarly, the roadmap for the rest of the essay could be a bit clearer: spell out that you will examine three main justifications, and anticipate that you will ultimately (at least provisionally) favor the third but see problems with all.

3. **Philosophical Depth and Balance**
   - Your critique of the second justification (self-realization as axiologically prior) is tight, but could engage more directly with Rawls’s claims about the centrality of self-respect and its purported universality.
   - The objections to the third (relational) justification lean heavily on empirical claims (e.g., about the time-lag and possible loss to the untalented poor); you might mention possible replies (for instance, that justice, as fairness, is always a matter of tradeoff and “imperfect” implementation in practice).
   - Consider acknowledging potential replies Rawlsians might give to your worries about instrumentalizing the talented poor (e.g., claims about fair reciprocity and participation as citizens).

4. **Original Position and Reflective Equilibrium**
   - You reference the original position and reflective equilibrium, but you could clarify more forcefully whether, on your analysis, the original position supports or undermines Rawls’s lexicographical ordering. Do the principles Rawls’s contractors would choose line up with your own judgments (or not), and what do we do if they conflict?
   - More explicit discussion of what the parties in the original position would likely endorse, based on the information and motives they are described as having, would help anchor your critique.

5. **Style and Readability**
   - The writing is often dense and could be more accessible, especially for readers not steeped in Rawls scholarship. Consider breaking up very long paragraphs and clarifying sentences with multiple clauses.
   - Some phrases or references (e.g., “Hydra’s decapitated neck”) might be toned down or made more precise for a philosophical audience.

### Minor Points

- **Footnotes**: These are thorough but could be simplified or reduced unless this is a requirement/style of your course. Consider which belong in the main text.
- **Citations**: All references seem appropriate and up-to-date with the literature. Ensure citation style matches your department’s guidelines.
- **Grammar and Typos**: Very few; mostly stylistic.

## **Summary**

**Overall, this is an excellent, graduate-level paper: it is clear, comprehensive, well-argued, and deeply researched.** It provides a rigorous treatment of a difficult and nuanced aspect of Rawls’s theory and demonstrates both understanding and independent critical thought. With a bit of tightening—especially to foreground your main thesis and bring out the practical upshot of your analysis—it could be of publishable quality in a student journal.

**Suggestions for revision**:
- Tighten your opening and conclusion to more clearly state and reiterate your main claim.
- Summarize at the end of each justification to keep the reader oriented.
- Address anticipated Rawlsian responses to your critique.
- Clarify the role of the original position in the structure of your critique.

**Fantastic work overall!**
