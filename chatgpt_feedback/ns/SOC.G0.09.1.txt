### Strengths

**1. Clear Engagement with Sociological Theory**  
You engage thoughtfully with the structure/agency debate—a central sociological question. Referencing theorists such as Melvin Pollner, Herbert Blumer, and Elijah Anderson shows both breadth and depth. The use of Kuhn at the end is an innovative touch that broadens your discussion beyond classic sociology.

**2. Original Argument about Laziness**  
Your argument that “laziness” (or a preference for the known) is a key factor in the persistence of structure is novel and insightful. This is not a common framing and shows creative sociological thinking.

**3. Integration of Empirical Examples**  
You effectively use Anderson’s discussion of stereotyping and master status to illustrate how people often default to known schemas (even harmful ones) out of cognitive economy (“facile but practical”).

**4. Theoretical Application**
You connect theoretical frameworks (e.g., ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism) to concrete examples and everyday processes, showing good mastery of theoretical application.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Clarity and Organization**  
- The introduction could clarify the roadmap for the paper and state the thesis more directly.
- Sometimes your paragraphs are quite dense. Breaking up longer paragraphs and using more topic sentences would make your argument easier to follow.

**2. Defining Key Terms**  
- “Laziness” is provocative, but it might work better to introduce and define it in sociological terms right away—perhaps as “preference for cognitive ease, habitual action, and routinization,” with “laziness” in parentheses.
- Be explicit about what you mean by “agency” and “structure” in the beginning for readers less familiar with these concepts.

**3. Balance and Development**
- The discussion of agency (as presented by Blumer) and of structure (as in Anderson) could be more explicitly connected. For example, further analyze how habitual action *mediates* between the extremes of agency and structure.
- The Kuhn reference is interesting but underdeveloped. A few sentences explaining the relevance of scientific paradigms and normal science to everyday social norms would strengthen your conclusion.

**4. Strengthen the Conclusion**
- Your conclusion insightfully brings together themes, but it could state more plainly how your discussion contributes to the existing literature on agency/structure.
- Suggest directions for further research or practical implications for understanding social change, norm persistence, or efforts to foster agency.

**5. Sentence-Level Issues**
- A few sentences are quite complex or wordy (“Leaving aside any origin stories…”)—try for more direct and concise phrasing where possible.
- Watch out for minor typos (“interpreters them” should be “interprets them”; “attention” might be a scanning error).

### Example of a Revised Introduction

**Current:**
> “One of the questions that has concerned Sociology throughout its history is the relationship between structure and agency, especially in terms of the ability of subjects (alone and in groups) to form, change, and/or overturn norms. Leaving aside any origin stories of norms, which would entail a great deal of speculation about the social organization of primitive man and ultimately be of little use, a clear understanding of how new norms develop provides important clues about the extent to which agentic subjects can affect their world and the mechanisms that facilitate or prevent people from making effective interventions…”

**Suggested:**
> “A central concern in sociology is the relationship between social structure and individual agency, particularly how subjects form, maintain, or change social norms. While much has been written on the conflict between these forces, less attention has been paid to a mundane but powerful element: individuals' tendency to prefer familiar patterns over novel alternatives—a form of social ‘laziness.’ By examining this tendency through the lenses of ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism, this essay argues that structural persistence is as much a product of cognitive and social economy as it is of explicit social control.”

### Summary

Overall, this is a strong undergraduate argument that demonstrates critical engagement with theory and original thinking. The argument is sophisticated and well-supported, but clarity, definition of terms, and organization could be improved for maximum impact.

**Grade estimate: A-/B+** (with strong potential for A with more polish and tightening).
