## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Organization and Flow**
- **Transitions Between Ideas:** At times, the paper jumps between implications, strengths/weaknesses, and broader impact without always providing clear transitions. Consider using clearer topic sentences at the start of paragraphs to guide the reader.
    - *Suggestion:* Use headings or more distinct topic sentences (e.g., “Methodological Strengths,” “Ethical Concerns,” “Broader Societal Impact”).

### 2. **Depth of Critique**
- **Ethical Concerns:** The essay could delve deeper into the ethical implications of lack of consent, both for staff and patients. What are the potential harms, and how could these affect the validity or acceptance of the findings?
- **Alternative Explanations:** Consider exploring alternative interpretations of Rosenhan’s findings, or how critics of the study have responded.

### 3. **Clarity and Precision**
- **Clarity of Some Sentences:** A few sentences are overly long or complex, which can obscure your point. For example:  
    - “All of these biases could include a deep feeling of hostility or affection towards the staff. Such feelings the observations are based on pseudopatient reports, which may contain some observer biases."
    - This could be simplified for clarity.
- **Repetition:** Some points are restated in similar terms without adding new information (e.g., the influence on diagnosis criteria is mentioned several times).
    - *Suggestion:* Aim for concise restatements, or combine similar observations.

### 4. **Evidence and Examples**
- **Support With Examples:** When discussing staff mistreatment or pseudopatient experiences, brief specific examples from the Rosenhan study (e.g., how notes were interpreted as symptoms, or how staff responded) would enrich the critique.

### 5. **Academic Style**
- **Voice and Tone:** While the essay is generally formal, some clauses are slightly informal or conversational (“As with any intriguing news, society passes the information around and causes a stir therefore making the study a huge influence.”).
    - *Suggestion:* Maintain a consistent academic tone throughout.

### 6. **Conclusion**
- **Stronger Summing Up:** The essay closes with a recognition of the study’s controversy and continued debate, but would benefit from a more concise concluding paragraph that reiterates your overall evaluation (i.e., does the study’s value outweigh its weaknesses?).

## Sample Revision of a Paragraph

*Original:*
> On the other hand, the fact that the other patients and staff were unaware of being monitored leads to some ethical issues. The pseudopatients did not provide the staff and patients with informed consent, which is one of the most important rules in data collection and research. Failure to do so may have jeopardized the validity of Rosenhan’s article. ...

*Revision:*
> Conversely, Rosenhan’s use of covert observation raises significant ethical concerns. Neither staff nor patients provided informed consent to participate in the research, contravening key ethical guidelines in psychological studies. This lack of transparency not only raises questions about the rights of those observed but may also undermine the validity and acceptance of Rosenhan’s conclusions, as participants might have behaved differently if they knew they were being studied.
