Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on the argument, structure, use of sources, style, and areas for improvement.

---

**Overall Assessment:**  
Your essay presents a well-structured and thoughtful argument against the constitutional rights of fetuses, particularly in the context of US law and landmark Supreme Court cases. You demonstrate a clear understanding of the legal and philosophical dimensions of the abortion debate, and you engage directly with both legal texts and counterarguments. Your use of sources is appropriate, and you make effective use of philosophical and legal literature to support your claims.

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Thesis:**  
   Your thesis is clearly stated: "I believe that the fetus is not guaranteed rights under the Constitution." This is echoed and reinforced throughout the paper, providing focus and cohesion.

2. **Strong Organization:**  
   The paper is logically organized, moving from an introduction of the problem, to your argument, to opposing views, and finally to responses and conclusion. Subsections (I, II, III, etc.) are helpful for the reader.

3. **Effective Use of Legal and Philosophical Sources:**  
   You draw appropriately from the Constitution (especially the Fourteenth Amendment), relevant Supreme Court cases, and philosophical arguments (Harman, Gillespie). This grounds your argument in both law and ethics.

4. **Engagement with Opposing Views:**  
   There is a robust engagement with alternative positions (proto-persons, legal cases involving fetuses, religious arguments). You clearly articulate and respond to oppositional points.

5. **Analytical Reasoning:**  
   Your responses to counterarguments are generally incisive, and you articulate why legal or emotional appeals to fetal rights fall short given constitutional constraints.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - There are some sentences that are wordy or unclear—for example: “Most cases instead see a place for fetal rights, but instead get lost in language of ‘a compelling state interest,’ or the ‘life and health of the mother.’” This could be clarified and tightened for easier reading.
   - Be careful with pronoun references (e.g., “this new identity of the citizen” could be clearer).

2. **Depth of Legal Analysis:**
   - While you cite the Fourteenth Amendment well, consider engaging more deeply with Roe v. Wade’s actual reasoning, not just the outcome. Also, you might briefly mention how Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) has changed the landscape (if writing post-2022).
   - You may want to more directly address counterarguments regarding the Ninth Amendment ("unenumerated rights") and the broader doctrine of substantive due process, even if you ultimately conclude they do not support fetal rights.

3. **Philosophical Nuance:**
   - The Harman "Actual Future Principle" is interesting and relevant, but the transition from her philosophical argument to its policy implications could be more clearly delineated. Spell out more of the moral vs. legal distinction.
   - When discussing religious arguments, it might be worth more explicitly differentiating between moral and legal claims.

4. **Use of Evidence:**
   - Occasionally you assert points (e.g., about women’s rights, or about court reasoning), which could be strengthened with brief specific quotes or citations.

5. **Tone and Academic Objectivity:**
   - There are some places where your tone becomes a bit polemical, e.g., “seriously damages the credibility of Supreme Court decisions” or “blatant violation of women’s rights.” Try to maintain a more consistently analytical and less emotional tone.
   - The conclusion, while strong, might be a bit too certain: “no amount of philosophical argument...will convince pro-life leaders” and “lack of substance to the arguments for fetal rights” could be softened to acknowledge existing philosophical complexity.

6. **Formatting and Citations:**
   - Your footnote indicators (“CP, 150”, “Gillespie, 239”) should be standardized into a regular citation style (e.g., Chicago, APA, etc.).
   - The bibliography is solid, but ensure consistency and full information for each source.

---

**Minor Points:**

- Watch out for minor grammatical errors (“cat or law” instead of “act or law” in a quote).
- Consider adding a more explicit "road map" paragraph at the beginning to guide your reader through the paper’s structure.
- There are some typographical artifacts from the source text (“previability”), make sure your formatting is clean and professional.

---

**Summary of Suggestions for Revision:**

1. Tighten up language for clarity and conciseness.
2. Deepen engagement with key legal cases and doctrines.
3. More cleanly separate moral, legal, and religious arguments.
4. Use a more consistently scholarly tone.
5. Standardize citation format and fix minor typos.

---

**Final Note:**
This is a strong, well-argued essay on a complex and contested issue. With some tightening of prose, deeper legal engagement, and a bit more nuance, it would be well-suited for a senior undergraduate philosophy or legal studies course. Well done!
