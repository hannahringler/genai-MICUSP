Certainly! Here is some detailed feedback on the paper **“Arrowsmith and the Ascent of an Industry”**:

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Strong Thesis and Structure**
- The paper begins with a clear thesis that sets up an analytical framework, focusing on the interplay between scientific enthusiasm, the commercialization of medicine, and ethics.
- Each paragraph begins with a topic sentence, maintaining logical progression throughout the essay.

### **2. Effective Use of Evidence**
- The essay is rich in references to the texts (Arrowsmith, Microbe Hunters, etc.), supporting its claims with quotations and page numbers.
- Comparative analysis between *Arrowsmith*, *Microbe Hunters*, and *The Social Transformation of American Medicine* is thoughtful and well-connected to your argument.
- The essay does a nice job integrating secondary sources (e.g., Morantz-Sanchez) to contextualize Lewis’s portrait of medicine, offering a more nuanced perspective.

### **3. Awareness of Historical Context**
- The discussion makes it clear that you understand the broader historical context: the rise of medicine as an industry, the impact of professionalization, and changing public attitudes toward doctors.

### **4. Nuanced Critique**
- Your critique of Lewis as simultaneously a “popularizer” is sophisticated and sharp.
- You recognize the satirical intentions behind *Arrowsmith*, but also point out potential oversimplifications and exaggerations.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### **1. Transitions and Flow**
- Although your argument is logical, some transitions between paragraphs or ideas could be improved for smoother reading. For example, the shift from discussing commercialism to trustworthiness might benefit from a more explicit link (e.g., how commercialization breeds mistrust).

### **2. Introduction and Conclusion**
- The introduction could do more to briefly summarize the main arguments or themes that will be addressed, helping orient the reader.
- The conclusion nicely recapitulates the main points, but could be strengthened by reflecting on what the analysis tells us more broadly about the relationship between literature and medicine, or about the continuing relevance of these issues.

### **3. Clarity and Conciseness**
- Some sentences are a bit lengthy or could be more direct. For example:
  - “Through his depiction of the novel’s main character, Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, and the actions of his colleagues and the general population, Lewis illustrates how this was an era in which the general population of America was enthralled with medicine and new scientific discoveries.”
  - Could become: “By portraying Dr. Martin Arrowsmith and his colleagues, Lewis reveals America’s fascination with medicine and scientific discovery in the early twentieth century.”
- Avoid minor redundancy, such as saying “Lewis also makes it clear…” where "Lewis shows" would suffice.

### **4. Balancing Critique and Praise**
- The criticism of Lewis’s “overly sardonic” tone is apt, but the paper could offer more examples of what is “successful” in his depiction (beyond capturing excitement). What, specifically, is accurate or insightful about his portrait of medicine?
- When discussing De Kruif and others, you might clarify your own stance a bit more—do you agree with Lewis's cynicism, or with the more heroic portrayals?

### **5. Minor Factual/Error Corrections**
- Watch out for minor errors: e.g., “Arrowhead” instead of “Arrowsmith” in one spot.
- Be consistent in referencing novel names and author names.

## **Suggestions for Further Development**

- Consider exploring whether commercialization and ethical dilemmas in medicine are still relevant today—connecting past to present.
- If space permits, a discussion of the literary techniques Lewis employs (satire, character development, etc.) could enrich the analysis.
- Quoting brief excerpts—rather than just referencing page numbers—may help illustrate your points more vividly.

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a strong, well-organized, and thoughtful essay that reflects a good understanding of both the literary and historical dimensions of *Arrowsmith* and its context. Polishing transitions, sentence structure, and the balance between critique and praise would make this an even better paper. Excellent work!
