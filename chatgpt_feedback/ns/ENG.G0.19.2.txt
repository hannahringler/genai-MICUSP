Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback report for your paper, organized under strengths, areas for improvement, and some specific suggestions for revision:

---

**Strengths**

1. **Strong Thesis and Focus:**  
   - Your thesis is clear: you convincingly argue that Ellison’s *Invisible Man* traces an existentialist journey, culminating in the narrator’s self-discovery and assertion of individual agency.
   - The essay maintains a tight focus on this central theme, referring consistently to existentialist concepts and to the “freedom of one word”—“absurd.”

2. **Effective Use of Quotations:**  
   - You integrate direct quotes from both existentialist philosophers and Ellison’s novel to back up your insights.
   - Each quotation is well-chosen and clearly linked to your argument, which strengthens the analysis.

3. **Textual Analysis:**  
   - Interpretation of key scenes (battle royal, moment with Ras, underground cave) is perceptive and nuanced.
   - You successfully trace the narrator’s psychological and philosophical development, both as a character and an existential symbol.

4. **Structure and Flow:**  
   - The essay progresses logically from introduction to close reading to conclusion, mirroring the narrator’s journey.
   - Topic sentences clearly guide the reader through each analytic point.

**Areas for Improvement**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:**  
   - Some sentences are overly complex or wordy, which can make your analysis harder to follow. For instance:
     > “It is this philosophy that detonates what superficially appears to be the doctrine of a dark and dismal lifestyle, yet it is quite the opposite.”
     Consider simplifying for directness and clarity.

2. **Grammar and Syntax:**  
   - There are occasional grammatical mistakes and awkward phrasings:
     - *“the simplifications and theoretical definitions of others have determined what ‘being human’ predicates…”* (insert “that others” for clarity)
     - *“…each time he throws off that mask, he finds himself trapped inside another stereotype or disguise.”* (Consider “another mask or disguise” for parallelism)
   - Watch out for agreement errors (e.g. “demands any longer” → “demands any longer”).

3. **Repetitiveness:**  
   - Some ideas (e.g., the “movement from rural innocence to cosmopolitan maturity and disillusionment”) are repeated multiple times, especially in introduction and conclusion. Try to avoid this repetition by condensing or rephrasing.

4. **Transition and Coherence:**  
   - Occasionally, the transition from summary to analysis or between examples feels abrupt. Adding a brief transitional phrase or topic sentence can help maintain smooth flow.
   - For example, moving from close reading of the battle royal to later chapters could use clearer signposting.

5. **Develop Your Conclusion:**  
   - The paper ends strongly, but the final paragraph could briefly reflect on the broader significance of existentialism in literature or the contemporary relevance of Ellison’s message.

**Specific Suggestions**

- **Introduction:**  
  Consider condensing the existentialist philosopher quotes and more quickly introducing your thesis about *Invisible Man*.
  
- **Body:**  
  When you analyze a passage, always tie it back explicitly to your thesis about existential freedom and self-definition.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  Expand your final paragraph to comment on why Ellison’s existential bildungsroman remains relevant—how does his protagonist’s journey resonate with readers today?

- **Proofreading:**  
  Read the whole essay out loud or use a grammar checker for minor errors.

**Overall**
This is a sophisticated, insightful essay that demonstrates strong engagement with both Ellison’s novel and existential philosophy. With some tightening of language and more polish, this would be an excellent upper-level undergraduate analysis. Great work!
