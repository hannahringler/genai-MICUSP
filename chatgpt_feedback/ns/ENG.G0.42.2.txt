Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on **"THE LADDER: Sexuality of Ancient Greece as an instrument of social mobility"**. This feedback covers your thesis, use of evidence, structure, clarity, style, and suggestions for improvement.

---

## Thesis and Argument

**Strengths:**
- **Clear and Nuanced Thesis:** Your central claim—that ancient Greek sexuality was less about gendered desire and more about power, social position, and mobility—is well articulated and sophisticated.
- **Complex Understanding:** You skillfully question modern frameworks (“homosexual/homosexual dichotomy”) and explain ancient Greek perspectives thoroughly.

**Suggestions:**
- **Explicit Thesis Statement:** It may be helpful to state your thesis a bit more explicitly at the end of your introductory paragraph. This will help your reader immediately grasp your central argument.

---

## Use of Evidence

**Strengths:**
- **Diverse Sources:** You reference poets (Anacreon, Pindar), philosophers (Plato), historians (Aeschines), and scholars (Halperin, Winkler)—this creates a rich, layered foundation for your argument.
- **Well-chosen Quotes:** Key passages (like Diotima in Plato’s Symposium) are used effectively.

**Suggestions:**
- **Integration of Quotes:** Occasionally, quotes appear without enough direct analysis or connection to your topic sentence. It would strengthen your argument to more clearly signal *why* you are introducing each piece of evidence. For example, after quoting Plato, explain succinctly how this supports your power/social mobility thesis.
- **Context for Sources:** Give a brief context for less well-known sources/authors (like Artemidoros), especially for readers unfamiliar with these figures.

---

## Structure and Organization

**Strengths:**
- **Logical Flow:** The paper progresses from literary examples to theoretical discussions and ultimately to concrete historical cases (e.g., Timarchos), demonstrating thoughtful organization.
- **Clear Paragraphing:** Each paragraph has a clear topic and focuses on a discrete aspect of the argument.

**Suggestions:**
- **Transitions:** Some paragraphs could use stronger transitional sentences tying one idea to the next. Occasionally, the argument jumps a little abruptly.

---

## Clarity and Style

**Strengths:**
- **Sophisticated Diction:** You write with an academic and analytical tone appropriate for upper-level undergraduate work.
- **Varied Sentence Structure:** Sentences flow well and avoid monotony.

**Suggestions:**
- **Clarity Over Complexity:** Occasionally, complex ideas crowd into one sentence, making it a bit convoluted (e.g., “Taking the poet’s full collection into account, then, might suggest desires motivated by some other factor than male flesh.”). Try to break up long sentences to enhance clarity.
- **Avoid Ambiguity:** In some places, referents are unclear (e.g., “the ‘right and wrongs’ of sex”). Specify whose right and wrong—by whose standards?

---

## Technical Details & Citations

**Strengths:**
- **Extensive Citations:** You credit your sources clearly and consistently.
- **Use of Primary & Secondary Sources:** Both are well-represented.

**Suggestions:**
- **Citation Format:** Consider tidying up citation style (the use of superscripts and endnotes may distract—footnotes or parenthetical references are sometimes preferred depending on the style guide).
- **Minor Typos:** “deemd” should be “deemed,” etc.

---

## Argumentative Development

**Strengths:**
- **Contrasts to Modern Standards:** You do an excellent job showing why applying modern sexual identity terms to the ancients is anachronistic.
- **Strong Conclusion:** You wrap up effectively, referring back to your main argument and framing ancient practices in light of modern values.

**Suggestions:**
- **Counterargument:** Briefly addressing a potential counterargument or limitation (for example, places where “preference” or affection did matter in antiquity, or scholarship that disputes your view) would deepen your analysis.

---

## Summary

**Overall, this is a strong, nuanced, and well-researched essay.** With minor refinement, it could be even more compelling:

- Clarify and foreground your thesis.
- Integrate and analyze evidence more tightly.
- Smooth transitions and break up dense sentences.
- Briefly acknowledge and address counterpoints.

**Excellent work on a complex and sensitive topic!**
