Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on the paper, organized into several areas commonly considered for undergraduate historical writing: **argument, evidence, structure, analysis, style, and engagement with sources.**

---

## Argument & Thesis

**Strengths:**
- The central argument is clear: the paper contrasts the portrayals of Augustus in Suetonius and Tacitus, ultimately arguing that Tacitus’ critical perspective is more compelling and believable than Suetonius’ more forgiving account.
- There is direct engagement with the primary sources, with quotations and references to specific passages.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The thesis could be stated even more explicitly at the end of the introduction, making clear not just that there is a contrast, but which depiction the author will favor and why.
- The assertion that Tacitus’ account is "more valid" could be handled with a bit more nuance—rather than suggesting one is categorically better, you might reference the different historical contexts and purposes of the authors.

## Evidence & Use of Sources

**Strengths:**
- Specific citations from both Suetonius’ *Divus Augustus* and Tacitus’ *Annals* demonstrate careful reading and support assertions.
- The paper gives concrete examples of both praise and criticism of Augustus from each author.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The quotations are sometimes dropped into the text without full contextual explanation. For instance, after quoting Suetonius, explain in your own words why this is significant for your argument.
- It would strengthen the analysis to acknowledge why Suetonius might want to portray Augustus positively (e.g., writing under the early Principate, focus on entertaining biography vs. Tacitus’s senatorial critique).

## Structure & Organization

**Strengths:**
- The paper is logically structured: starts with an introduction, then moves to Suetonius, then Tacitus, then a comparison/contrast, and concludes with an evaluation.
- The discussion devoted to both authors is balanced.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The introduction could do more to set up the stakes—why does this debate matter for our understanding of Augustus, or even for Roman history more generally?
- The conclusion could go further than merely restating the argument; perhaps touch on the broader implications of how we assess ancient historical sources.
- At times, paragraphs shift topics quickly (e.g., from the reputation of Augustus to Tiberius’s succession) without clear signposting or transitions.

## Analysis & Critical Engagement

**Strengths:**
- The analysis of Tacitus’s skepticism and Suetonius’s efforts to balance faults and virtues is thoughtful.
- The paper’s critical voice emerges strongly in the preference for Tacitus.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Try to consider (even if briefly) what motivates both authors, and the possible biases of each; e.g., Tacitus’s own disillusionment with the Principate, Suetonius’s context and aims.
- Acknowledge the limits of both sources—are we really able to know the “real” Augustus, or only layers of literary construction?

---

## Style & Clarity

**Strengths:**
- The writing is generally clear and engaging.
- The tone is appropriate, confident, and the vocabulary is strong ("fawning imperial bootlickers," "corruption," etc).

**Areas for Improvement:**
- At times, the prose becomes a bit informal or slips into overly rhetorical language (e.g., "monster Augustus" or "imperial bootlickers")—try to maintain critical distance.
- Avoid editorializing without support ("his account was obviously paying the attack far more attention than the praise"—make this point with a quantitative reference or examples).

## Engagement with Historiography

**Suggestions:**
- A truly standout paper might briefly mention how later historians (or modern scholars) have continued this debate, or what’s at stake for our historical understanding; even a sentence or two could enrich your conclusion.

## Overall Impression

This is a solid, well-structured undergraduate essay with a clear argument, good use of evidence, and strong comparative analysis. It would be improved with more explicit structuring of claims, some engagement with the broader context/purpose of the ancient authors, and a touch more critical distance.

If you were to revise this, focus on integrating your quotations smoothly, clarifying your thesis, and always connecting your close readings of Suetonius and Tacitus back to the bigger historical questions.

**Grade estimate (if desired):** Strong B+ to A-, depending on instructor expectations.
