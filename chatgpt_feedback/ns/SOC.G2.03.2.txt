Absolutely! Below is detailed feedback on your essay, structured to address key areas: **thesis and argumentation, organization and structure, use of evidence, analysis and critical thinking, clarity and style, and general areas for improvement**.

---

**Thesis and Argumentation**
- Your thesis is clear and sets up the paper well: you identify that Hobbes and Malthus share similar views on human nature but diverge significantly in their prescriptions for social organization. The explanation about historical context as the driver of their differing conclusions is strong.
- The second part of the paper—on Marx’s dual critique of liberalism and his use of anti-positivism—is well-introduced and follows logically from the prompt.

**Organization and Structure**
- The essay is well organized and proceeds logically from the premises of each thinker to detailed points of comparison, then to historical context, and finally to Marx.
- Headings (e.g., "Hobbes’ Social Organization," "Malthus’s Social Organization," etc.) make your structure clear.
- Each major section addresses a component of the prompt, and you provide transitions that help the paper flow.

**Use of Evidence**
- You make effective use of primary texts, with clear in-text citations and well-integrated quotations.
- Your references to specific arguments (e.g., from *Leviathan*, Malthus's checks, Marx’s four alienations) are accurate and demonstrate critical engagement.
- Additional references to secondary sources (like Somers & Block) effectively bolster your points on context.

**Analysis and Critical Thinking**
- You thoughtfully compare and contrast Hobbes and Malthus, showing both their micro-level similarities and macro-level divergences.
- The integration of historical context is a strong analytic move, going beyond surface-level comparison to deeper causal explanation.
- In the Marx section, you apply the concepts of false consciousness and anti-positivism with sophistication, showing how they underlie Marx’s critique.

**Clarity and Style**
- The writing is generally clear, well-structured, and largely free of grammatical errors.
- Complex ideas are explained in understandable terms, making the essay accessible even to a reader who may not be a specialist.
- Jargon is used appropriately, with definitions/explanations provided for technical terms.
- Try to avoid repetition—some points (e.g., humans as inherently self-interested) appear multiple times in similar language.

**Specific Strengths**
- Your summary and analysis of Hobbes’s social contract reasoning is concise and accurate.
- The differentiation between “political” and “human” emancipation in Marx is well explained.
- The discussion of Marx's use of anti-positivism is nuanced, and you make good use of textual evidence from multiple works.

**Areas for Improvement**
1. **Depth vs. Breadth:** 
    - The essay covers a lot of ground—sometimes at the expense of depth. For example, the Marx section condenses very complex arguments; you might choose to develop fewer points more deeply.

2. **Transitions:**
    - Some transitions between writers/sections are abrupt. For instance, the shift from Malthus back to general comparison with Hobbes could benefit from clearer “signposting.”
   
3. **Engagement with Counterarguments:**
    - Consider briefly acknowledging counterarguments or limitations (e.g., debates about whether Hobbes truly supports authoritarianism or whether Malthus misreads the effects of welfare).

4. **Marx Section Focus:**
    - The critique of “political and economic liberalism” is strong, but you might add a sentence clarifying why Marx’s approach is particularly “anti-positivist” for readers less familiar with that term.
    - The passage about Marx being “both a philosopher and a political activist” could engage more with how those roles impact his analyses (e.g., how his theory blends analysis and praxis).

5. **Conclusion:**
    - The conclusion of each question could be slightly stronger. After summarizing, add one or two sentences on the broader implications of your analysis—or how it applies to social theory today.

**Minor Notes**
- Footnotes for explanations (e.g., explanations of “preventative” and “positive” checks, types of alienation) are helpful, though in places they could be worked directly into the text for flow.
- Be careful with length and conciseness; some passages are slightly wordy and might be more concise.

**Overall Assessment**  
This is a strong paper. The argument is clear, the evidence is well-chosen and integrated, and your use of primary and secondary sources shows genuine engagement with the texts. With some work on transitions and a slight shift toward depth over breadth, this paper would be even stronger.

**Grade Estimate:** A- to A (with minor revisions).
