Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback assessment of your essay, **"Anti-Aristotelian Kane":**

---

### **Overall Strengths**

**1. Strong Comparative Focus:**  
You clearly frame your analysis as a comparison between *Aristotelian* tragedy and *Sarah Kane's* "Blasted." This provides your argument with direction and depth.

**2. In-Depth Textual Engagement:**  
You use textual evidence effectively, especially through references to *Oedipus Rex* and direct quotations from *Blasted*. Your discussion of the Greek tragedy model is grounded and well-supported.

**3. Analytical Complexity:**  
You move beyond summarizing plot to analyze the mechanics and philosophy underpinning each form of drama. Your exploration of causality, volition, and the relationship between character and plot is particularly nuanced.

**4. Clear Structure and Argument Flow:**  
Your essay follows a logical progression, beginning with Aristotle, moving to Kane, and then synthesizing their differences. Paragraphs are generally focused, and transitions are smooth.

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Thesis Clarity:**  
Your introduction establishes general opposition between Aristotle and Kane, but could benefit from a slightly more explicit thesis statement. Try summarizing your central claim in a single sentence, e.g.:

*“While Aristotle envisions tragedy as a vehicle for mimicking an ordered and moral reality, Kane’s ‘Blasted’ inverts this paradigm by portraying a world of chaos, amorality, and human agency.”*

**2. Context and Stakes:**  
It would help to briefly explain *why* this comparison matters. How does understanding this shift impact our reading of modern theater, or our conception of reality and art? Adding a sentence or two on the greater significance elevates your paper.

**3. Depth on Kane:**  
While your Aristotle section is analytically rich, the analysis of "Blasted" could go deeper. Consider adding more about Kane’s dramaturgical choices:  
- How does the play’s form (fragmented, episodic, violent) interpret or embody her worldview?  
- What is the effect on the audience? (e.g., Brechtian alienation, contemporary shock, etc.)

**4. Precision in Language:**  
Some sentences are a little dense or abstract. For example:  
*"Rather than constructing a plot arc causally linked by probability and necessity as Aristotle suggested is ideal, she shapes one that resists clearly definable teleology and inevitability."*  
Try breaking these up for clarity:  
*"While Aristotle favored plots with clear causal links, Kane resists this form of structural inevitability, creating a story that feels unpredictable and illogical."*

**5. More on Reception:**  
You hint at how the different structures elicit *pity* or *recognition* in audiences. Expanding on how classical and contemporary audiences might have reacted (or were intended to react) to these plays would provide further depth.

---

### **Minor Suggestions:**

- **Proofreading:** There are minor typographical errors (e.g., "playwright's like Kane" should be "playwrights like Kane").
- **Citation Integration:** Occasionally, the insertion of block quotes interrupts the flow. Try integrating quotations more fluidly.
- **Formatting:** Use italics or quotation marks consistently for play titles (e.g., *Blasted*, *Oedipus Rex*).

---

### **Summary**

**Your essay is a sophisticated, well-argued comparative analysis of Aristotle’s and Kane’s tragic models.** With some further sharpening of your thesis, deeper focus on Kane’s dramaturgical choices and their effects, and clarification of language, this paper could be outstanding. You demonstrate strong critical thinking and close reading skills.
