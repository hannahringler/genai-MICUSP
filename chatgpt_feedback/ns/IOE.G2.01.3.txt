Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper “Managing Change,” organized by strengths and opportunities for improvement, followed by specific comments.

## Strengths

1. **Clear Organization**  
   The paper is well-structured, with numbered sections and sub-sections (Organizational Diagnosis, Approach to Change, Anticipated Support and Resistance, and Change Plan). This makes the argument easy to follow and digest.

2. **Relevant and Focused Issues**  
   The choice to focus on pay basis, work-group diversity, and communication style is well-justified and relevant to the industry in question. You make a convincing case about how these systemic issues impact both efficiency and customer perception.

3. **Pragmatic, Actionable Suggestions**  
   Your proposed solutions (modifying compensation, restructuring teams, communication workshops) are practical, detailed, and reflect awareness of real-world constraints. You show understanding of both organizational theory and on-the-ground realities.

4. **Insightful Analysis of Culture and Behavior**  
   You go beyond surface-level recommendations, exploring how entrenched habits, comfort zones, and incentives shape behavior and how they can be changed.

5. **Anticipation of Challenges**  
   By addressing anticipated resistance—not only from staff but also in terms of cultural inertia—you present a realistic, thoughtful approach, rather than assuming change will be easy.

6. **Use of References**  
   The references you include (Bridges, Liker, Morgan) are apt and strengthen your credibility, tying practical changes to established organizational theories and best practices.

## Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Clarity and Flow of Language**
   - Some sentences are a bit lengthy and could be broken up for clarity. At times, the text gets bogged down with complex constructions (“A suggestion to help improve work group diversity is to institute structural changes that promote enhanced interaction...”). Consider more concise, active sentences to aid readability.
   - Watch for minor typographical and formatting errors (extraneous symbols, inconsistent hyphenation, occasional odd line breaks, e.g., "result").

2. **Depth of Analysis in Some Sections**
   - While the paper covers the issues well, some points could use more depth. For example, the discussion of work-group diversity could more explicitly address the business outcomes of diverse teams (e.g., improved problem solving, innovation, customer empathy).
   - The discussion of communication improvements might incorporate examples or evidence from similar cases or cite communication models/theories.

3. **Stakeholder Perspectives**
   - You acknowledge anticipated resistance but could further develop how you would actively involve employees in planning or piloting changes, not just informing them after the fact.
   - Consider the customer’s perspective a bit more: What specific feedback have customers given? Could you survey or focus-group them?

4. **Measurement and Evaluation**
   - How will PMC know that these changes are successful after implementation? Try specifying clear metrics: employee satisfaction scores, CSI improvement, turnover rates, throughput times, etc.

5. **Contextualization**
   - The introduction references a previous article but jumps quickly into solutions. For standalone readers, offer a brief background of PMC and its broader market situation.

## Specific Comments

- The integration of the three change domains (pay, diversity, communication) is excellent, especially your point about synergies.
- The critique of commission-based pay is balanced. You might strengthen your argument by citing some industry case studies or research on pay reform outcomes.
- The section on communication feels particularly strong, especially when you discuss how clichés and scripted calls erode customer trust.

### Overall Impression

This is a well-structured, thorough, and insightful critique and proposal. It reflects both academic knowledge and practical understanding of organizational change. With some improvements to clarity, depth, and measurement, this would be highly effective both as a critique and as an action plan.

If you’re looking for a grade or summary:  
**A-** (strong graduate-level work; polish language and deepen a few analytical points for full marks).
