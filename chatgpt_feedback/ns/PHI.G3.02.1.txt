# General Feedback

## Strengths

### 1. **Clear Structure and Progression**
- The essay is well-organized, moving logically from the problem (challenges for traditional representationalist intentionalism about qualia) through diagnosis and innovative proposal, to consideration of objections and extensions.
- Section divisions (Abstract, Introduction, Problems, Proposal, Reconsideration, Conclusion) make the argument easy to follow.

### 2. **Engagement with Philosophical Literature**
- You correctly situate the topic within major debates in philosophy of mind, referencing key issues (inverted spectrum, knowledge argument, explanatory gap), and you cite recognized figures (Chalmers, Shoemaker, Block, Jackson, Tye, Lycan, etc.).
- The essay does a solid job of distinguishing “representational content” from wider “intentional content,” showing a strong grasp of contemporary terminology and issues.

### 3. **Original Contribution**
- Your “self-imperative” account is genuinely innovative and directly responds to the limitations you see in narrow representationalism.
- You are careful to anticipate objections and to clarify what counts as an “imperative.”

### 4. **Clarity of Argument**
- Use of illustrative examples (Francis, musicians, carrots vs. carrots haters, etc.) makes abstract points vivid and digestible.
- You consistently summarize the point of each section as you move along, making it easier for the reader to stay oriented.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Further Clarification of "Self-Imperatives"**
- Although you explain the concept and direction-of-fit, it may be helpful to further spell out, perhaps with cognitive science/neuroscience illustrations, what distinguishes a “self-imperative” from, say, a desire or an ordinary motivational state. Are they realized in brain states? What’s their ontological status?
- How is your view different from some dispositionalist accounts of qualia (i.e., “pain is what disposes you to avoid it”)? If the answer is in the “intentionalist” cast of the imperative, that could use further distinction.

### 2. **Addressing Potential Objections**
- While you explicitly set aside the more traditional qualia challenges (inverted spectrum, etc.) to focus on your primary concern, someone strongly committed to those issues may want at least a paragraph mentioning how (if at all) your account might later address them, especially since you suggest your view is compatible with broad intentionalism.
- Does the self-imperative proposal re-open any problems raised by those classical arguments? For example, could a person’s self-imperative be inverted with respect to their damage representations (i.e., an “inverted Francis”)? Would this enable the same sort of “inverted spectrum” scenario? A few sentences acknowledging this might preempt a common objection.

### 3. **Empirical Plausibility and Scope**
- The claim that “every pleasure or pain quale is a self-imperative of a certain kind” might be unpacked further with respect to current scientific theories of pain and pleasure/motivation. Are there possible counterexamples or ambiguous cases?
- It might help to clarify whether all affective states, including non-action-guiding ones (like a mood or background sense of well-being), fit into your framework or whether those are set aside.

### 4. **Engagement with Related Theories**
- The boundary between your view and desire-based theories (e.g., “to be pleasurable is just to be desired”) is blurry. More explicit differentiation would show the unique force of your proposal.
- Are there antecedents or related approaches in the literature to the “imperative” idea (e.g., Alva Noë or Jesse Prinz on action-based consciousness)? Brief comparison would strengthen your originality claim.

### 5. **Minor Stylistic and Editorial Issues**
- Some sentences are quite long and might benefit from stylistic tightening.
- Qualified points (“maybe (though I don’t know) there are…” etc.) could sometimes be stated with more philosophical confidence, or else rephrased for succinctness.
- Occasional minor typographical errors (e.g., missing punctuation marks, formatting artifacts from OCR).

## Overall

This is an **ambitious, clear, and logically constructed paper** that contributes a thoughtful new perspective to intentionalist debates on qualia. The self-imperative account offers a promising solution to the “function/explanation gap” you diagnose, and the paper’s structure makes your reasoning easy to follow. Some additional clarification and anticipation of major objections would strengthen the argument, and briefer engagement with desire-theory, dispositionalism, or alternative action-based views would sharpen the originality and theoretical positioning.

### **Suggestions for Next Steps**

- Consider tightening your explanation of self-imperatives with reference to relevant cognitive science, or more precisely distinguish it from desires and dispositional accounts. (A footnote or short paragraph could suffice.)
- Add a brief, explicit discussion of how your self-imperative account would interact with (or sidestep) inverted spectrum and knowledge arguments.
- If this is for publication or grading, proofread for minor errors and further compress some of the more verbose passages.
- Consider whether your account could extend even **beyond** “action-guiding” qualia to more passive conscious states, and whether these count as genuine counterexamples.
