Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on your "Week 1 Reaction Paper: Disability Rights" based on content, analysis, organization, and writing style.

---

**Strengths**

1. **Clear Summary and Context:**  
   You summarize the Richard Bernstein case effectively, outlining the disability rights lawsuit against Detroit’s bus system. Your overview shows a good understanding of the importance of the ADA and the legal struggle for civil rights.

2. **Good Structure and Flow:**  
   The paper has a logical progression: you introduce the case, describe Bernstein’s strategies, explain the unfolding events, and then conclude with the broader impact.

3. **Effective Use of Specific Details:**  
   Citing actual media outlets, politicians, and the involvement of the Department of Justice adds credibility to your analysis. Details about how Bernstein built grassroots support are especially strong.

4. **Recognition of Social Change Mechanisms:**  
   You thoughtfully describe how social change is not only legal but also political, explaining how external pressures and public opinion can influence court cases.

**Areas for Improvement**

1. **Depth of Critical Analysis:**  
   While you narrate the facts well, your paper would benefit from deeper critical analysis. Reflect more on *why* Bernstein’s strategies were effective compared to others, or discuss potential limitations of legal advocacy for broader social change.

   - **Suggestion:** Consider specific challenges Bernstein might have faced or additional barriers people with disabilities encounter even after legal victories.

2. **Connection to Broader Themes:**  
   Your reaction can be strengthened by connecting this case to bigger themes or theories (i.e., models of disability, civil rights history, or grassroots organizing theory).

   - **Suggestion:** For example, briefly discuss how this case illustrates the social model of disability versus the medical model, or compare it to other civil rights cases.

3. **Personal Reaction or Interpretation:**  
   As a "reaction paper," your own thoughts and responses should play a stronger role. You describe what happened but don’t elaborate much on your feelings, insights, or opinions about the events or their significance.

   - **Suggestion:** Add a paragraph with your reflections: “This case made me realize…” or “I was surprised to learn that…” or “In my view, the most inspiring aspect of Bernstein’s strategy was…”

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The ending summarizes the social change, but could reiterate its broader impact, lessons learned, or the implications for current/future disability rights activism. Make your final paragraph resonate by tying back to your reaction or thesis.

   - **Suggestion:** You could close with: “Ultimately, this case demonstrates the necessity of combining legal channels with public advocacy to secure real, lasting change for marginalized communities.”

**Minor Writing Points**

- Be careful with passive voice (“was settled,” “was guaranteed”); try to keep the subject active when possible.
- Check for slight repetition, for example: “grassroots support” is mentioned several times—can you vary your language?
- Make sure every paragraph ties clearly back to your main argument or reaction.

**Overall Assessment**

This is a well-written and informative paper that clearly presents the facts and the importance of the Bernstein case. To elevate your work, engage more with your own critical thinking and reactions, and try to situate the case within a wider context of social movements or disability rights history. With these additions, your paper will provide not only a summary but also insightful analysis and personal engagement.

**Score/Grade (if applicable):**  
If I were grading this, I’d place it in the B+/A- range. With more personal insight and critical analysis, it would be a solid A.
