## General Feedback

### Strengths

**1. Clear Purpose & Structure**
- The paper has a clear aim: analyzing the different genres of discourse used in the University of Michigan synchronized swimming team.
- The introduction outlines the scope and provides helpful background on both the sport and the team.

**2. Well-Defined Concepts**
- The author thoroughly explains what “discourse genres” are within the context of sports and synchronized swimming specifically.
- The paper methodically introduces each genre (recruitment, land-drilling, coaching, pep-talks, etc.) and provides real examples.

**3. Detailed Use of Examples**
- Excerpts from FINA documents, team meetings, emails, and transcriptions of actual conversations make the analysis concrete and engaging.
- The glossary of terms specific to synchronized swimming is helpful for readers outside the community.

**4. Analytical Insight**
- There is thoughtful reflection on the effect of discourse style (e.g., casual vs. formal, shorthand, timing of coaching comments).
- The comparison between club and varsity teams, and suggested implications for coaching style, show critical thinking.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Organization & Flow**
- While thorough, the paper is dense and sometimes repetitive. Some sections could be streamlined to improve readability.
- The transitions between genres are sometimes abrupt. Consider using more explicit signposting to guide readers from one section/genre to the next.

**2. Thesis & Focus**
- The paper occasionally drifts from the main focus (discourse analysis) to more general commentary on the team or the sport.
- Make sure every section ties back to the analysis of discourse as a genre—avoid digressions.

**3. Integration of Literature/Theory**
- The paper would be stronger if it included more references or engagement with discourse analysis or genre theory. Even one or two citations would help situate the analysis academically.

**4. Visuals & Formatting**
- The embedded images are referenced but could be discussed more directly (e.g., how do the FINA diagrams aid understanding?).
- The list of specialized vocabulary could be categorized or formatted for scanning (bullet points or a table).

**5. Conclusion**
- The conclusion restates the uniqueness of the discourse community but could offer more concrete or actionable recommendations.
- Summarize key findings about how discourse shapes the team’s identity or effectiveness, not just what could change if pursuing varsity status.

### Minor Points

- Watch for minor grammatical mistakes or awkward phrasings (e.g., “could be one step close to becoming” → “could be one step closer to becoming”).
- When referencing transcripts, clarify who speakers are if possible—new readers won’t know the team members.
- Appendices are referenced but not included; if this is a real submission, ensure these are attached.

## Summary

**This paper is a thoughtful and thorough analysis of the “genre set” associated with synchronized swimming at Michigan. It uses rich, authentic data and clear explanations to illustrate the unique discourse of the sport. To strengthen the work, focus the discussion more tightly on discourse and genre theory, improve transitions between sections, and make the conclusion more impactful. A bit more attention to academic context and polish would make this a standout undergraduate paper in discourse analysis. Great job overall!**
