**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**

1. **Clarity and Structure**   
   - The writing is clear and well-organized. The argument flows logically, and it's easy to follow the reasoning from Eric’s initial claim to the counterexamples and the concluding questions.
   - You succinctly state the central philosophical issue: whether pain is *intrinsically* bad, or only bad because we *assign* it that value.

2. **Use of Examples**  
   - The examples of the devout Christian and the masochist are well-chosen and effective. They compellingly illustrate that pain can be experienced as “good” or “not bad,” depending on one’s values or context.

3. **Philosophical Sophistication**  
   - You demonstrate an understanding of the evaluative role and raise important objections to the view that pain is necessarily, intrinsically bad.
   - You’re also careful not to overreach—acknowledging the limited scope of a one-page paper and remaining open-ended.

4. **Nuanced Conclusion**  
   - You avoid dogmatism and recognize that the issue might not be easily resolvable within the short format, which shows philosophical humility.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Engaging more deeply with opposing arguments:**  
    - While you present good counterexamples, you might also consider brief responses an advocate of pain’s intrinsic badness could give. For instance, could it be that pain is still “bad” in a minimal sense (has a negative feel), even if someone *ascribes* positive meaning to it?
    - Exploring alternative explanations (e.g., that reflection or second-order attitudes can modify but not fully invert the intrinsic nature of pain) could deepen your analysis.

2. **Clarifying the distinction: assignment vs. intrinsic value**  
    - The distinction between what it means for pain to be “bad by assignment” versus “intrinsically bad” could be fleshed out a little more, even in a sentence or two.  
    - For example: “To say pain is intrinsically bad is to say that its badness is a feature of the experience itself, regardless of the subject’s evaluative stance. In contrast, if badness is assigned, the value comes from the subject’s attitudes or social conventions.”

3. **Consider possible ambiguities with terms**  
    - In philosophy, “bad” can mean “unpleasant,” “undesirable,” or “something to be avoided.” You might briefly clarify which sense is in play.

4. **Minor stylistic points**
    - A little more signposting would help (e.g., “Consider first…” or “Another example is…”).
    - The paragraphing is solid, but you might start a new paragraph where you shift from the devout Christian to the masochist, for clarity.

**Overall Impression:**  
This is a thoughtful and well-argued short paper. You present a subtle challenge to a widely-held view and stay focused on the philosophical question. With slightly more critical engagement with the other side, and a bit more clarity on definitions, this would be even stronger. As it stands, it’s an excellent response for a short assignment!

**Grade (if requested):** A- / B+ depending on class standards.
