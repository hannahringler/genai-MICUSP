Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on the paper, covering thesis, argumentation, structure, evidence, style, and suggestions for improvement:

---

**Thesis and Purpose**

- The essay establishes a clear comparison between Stone's "macro" (structuralist, long-term causes) and Kishlansky's "micro" (personal, individual-driven, narrative focused) approaches to the causes and history of the English Revolution. The central thesis is evident: their different historical lenses shape both their narratives and interpretations of blame regarding the Revolution’s outbreak.

**Argumentation and Structure**

- The paper is well-organized. It first presents Stone’s viewpoint, then Kishlansky’s, before moving to a critical comparison of both.
- You provide clear topic sentences and transitions, helping the reader follow your arguments.
- The analysis moves naturally from description to critique—pointing out the strengths and limitations of each approach.

**Use of Evidence**

- You offer solid textual evidence, citing specific passages and paraphrasing well.
- The inclusion of direct quotes (and your commentary following each) effectively backs your points about author tone and perspective.
- It might help to include page numbers for your Kishlansky references for future academic work if not already done (you do this for Stone).

**Comparative Analysis**

- Your comparative points are thoughtful. For example, you note how Stone’s structuralism gives history predictive power and generalizability, but at the cost of human immediacy; while Kishlansky’s personalization engages the reader but narrows the causation to individual failings or virtues.
- The discussion about blame/agency is sophisticated, recognizing the limitations of both approaches.

**Style and Clarity**

- Your language is generally clear, academic, and precise, with a good command of vocabulary.
- At times, sentences become a little long or complex (e.g., “But then the argument could also be turned to say that the flux of art interacts more intimately…”). Consider breaking up longer chains into shorter, punchier sentences for readability.
- The introduction is a little abrupt and could benefit from a stronger opening sentence that introduces the topic more broadly before jumping into the specific authors.

**Conclusion**

- The final paragraph nicely synthesizes your points, arguing that both perspectives are necessary for a nuanced understanding. This is a strong, mature standpoint.
- You answer the prompt well while remaining analytical, not just descriptive.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Introduction**: Open with a sentence situating the English Revolution as a historiographical debate, then narrow to Stone and Kishlansky. This would help orient readers not familiar with the subject.
2. **Thesis Clarity**: Summarize your main comparative finding in the introduction rather than only at the end—this helps guide the reader.
3. **Historical Context**: Briefly situate what the English Revolution was, in a sentence or two, for context.
4. **Counterargument**: Mention a possible criticism of each author more explicitly (e.g., Does Kishlansky risk oversimplifying? Does Stone’s approach sap history of agency?).
5. **Conclusion**: Consider ending with a broader statement about the value of historiographical plurality for students or modern readers.

**Minor/Technical Notes**

- Double-check that all quotes are correctly cited and punctuated.
- Watch for a few minor typos (“appreciation” should not be “and appreciation” on page 4).
- Use gender-inclusive language where relevant, although usage is mostly fine.

**Overall Assessment**

This is a perceptive, well-structured, and sophisticated comparative essay. With small improvements to introduction and flow, it would be even stronger. Your balance between detailed analysis and big-picture critique is excellent!
