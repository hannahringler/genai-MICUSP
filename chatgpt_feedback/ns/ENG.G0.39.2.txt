### Feedback on “The Image of Mary, Mother of Jesus, in Matthew and John”

#### **Strengths**

1. **Clear Argument**:  
   - You present a clear, focused thesis: that Mary’s role as the mother of Jesus is undermined in both Matthew and John, with specific evidence supporting this assertion.
2. **Close Textual Reading**:
   - You offer a careful close reading of passages in both gospels, and engage critically with how the text frames Mary’s experience and authority.
3. **Comparative Approach**:
   - You effectively compare the depiction of Mary in Matthew and John, noting both similarities (her sidelining) and differences (her silence/lack of agency in Matthew vs. anonymity in John).
4. **Originality**:
   - The argument about “divine rape” in Matthew is provocative and demonstrates critical engagement. The discussion of power dynamics and gender is thoughtful and original.
5. **Language and Mechanics**:
   - The writing is generally clear, and the citation of biblical passages supports your points well.

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Nuance and Theological Context**:
   - Your paper would benefit from acknowledging alternative interpretations, especially regarding Mary’s consent. For instance, in Luke’s Gospel (not your focus, but still relevant for contrast), Mary explicitly consents ("Let it be unto me according to your word").
   - Consider briefly noting the broader theological tradition and differing views (Catholic, Protestant, etc.) regarding Mary’s agency and role.
2. **Evidence and Interpretation**:
   - When discussing Matthew’s text, you argue Mary’s pregnancy “may not have been consensual” or that she is a “victim of divine rape.” This is a bold claim and needs more careful justification or at least acknowledgment that it is a possible, not a definitive, reading. It would help your argument to address counterarguments or the nuance of the biblical language (e.g., the angel speaking in a dream to Joseph does not preclude an angelic encounter with Mary in another tradition).
   - Watch for overgeneralization (“takes away from her role as mother because the text gives Joseph total dominion over her body”), as this could be more thoroughly contextualized.
3. **Organization & Flow**:
   - The paper would benefit from a stronger sense of structure. Each paragraph sometimes flows into the next without clear topic sentences or signposting for the reader. Creating clear sections for “Mary in Matthew” and “Mary in John,” with respective subpoints, would make your analysis easier to follow.
4. **Use of Secondary Sources**:
   - Currently, your essay relies solely on your own reading and class discussion. Consider engaging with at least one or two biblical scholars or theologians (even briefly) to provide context or to demonstrate engagement with scholarly debate.
5. **Conclusion**:
   - The conclusion is somewhat abrupt. Consider summarizing your main points and restating the significance of your argument. What are the broader implications for understanding the depiction of women and mothers in scripture? What does this reading of Mary invite readers to reconsider?
6. **Word Choice**:
   - While your analysis is bold, be aware that terms such as “divine rape” and “dominion over her body” are very strong and can be seen as anachronistic or controversial. It’s acceptable to use strong terms but important to signal you are offering a critical/feminist reading and to acknowledge that others may disagree.

### Sample Revised Thesis Statement

> “In both Matthew and John, Mary’s role as the mother of Jesus is diminished—not only is her agency limited in key moments surrounding Jesus’ conception and early life, but the texts prioritize male authority figures, both divine and earthly, to the exclusion of Mary’s voice and authority as a mother.”

### Final Thoughts

This is a strong, original paper that demonstrates both a close engagement with the biblical text and a willingness to ask challenging questions. With a bit more context, nuance, and organization, it would be even more compelling. Be sure to clarify when you are presenting a possible interpretation rather than a settled fact, and consider the value of engaging alternate viewpoints.

**Grade Estimate (if appropriate):** B+/A- (with potential to go higher with more scholarly engagement and organization)
