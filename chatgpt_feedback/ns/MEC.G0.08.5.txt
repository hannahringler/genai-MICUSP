Absolutely! Below is structured feedback on your paper, considering both technical content and writing/presentation:

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Comprehensive Coverage**
- The paper closely follows the project requirements, addressing all the asked tasks: grid independence, velocity and pressure fields, reattachment length, pressure distribution, drag coefficients, separation angles, and Strouhal number.
- Each section clearly states its aim and references the relevant figures in both your results and in Braza et al., ensuring traceability.

### **2. Clear Methodology**
- The methodology is detailed, particularly regarding the CFD setup in **Fluent** and mesh generation in **Gambit**.
- Choices like refining the grid until mesh independence, and step-by-step procedures for trial runs, indicate good engineering practice.

### **3. Strong Visualization**
- Plots and figures are well integrated, with clear referencing throughout the text.
- Side-by-side comparisons to published results (from Braza et al.) strengthen confidence in your results.

### **4. Data Transparency**
- Tables summarizing mesh independence, trial results, and key output (Cd, Θd, St) are well-organized.
- Reporting values and percent differences demonstrates a quantitative rather than qualitative validation.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### **1. Writing and Clarity**
- Some sentences are long and can be broken up for clarity (e.g., in “Our first task was to show…next we had to…”).
- While technical, some sections could be clarified: briefly explaining Karman vortex streets for readers less familiar, or more context around why certain boundary conditions or steps (like mesh scaling) were chosen.
- Double-check for typos and consistency in terminology (e.g., "reattachment length" is sometimes one word, sometimes two).

### **2. Technical Rigor**
- **Mesh Independence:** 
   - You mention using Re=400 for mesh independence but then apply a single mesh universally; briefly justify why this is sufficient for all Re (some readers may wonder about applicability across the studied range).
- **Boundary Conditions:**  
   - It would help to describe (perhaps in a figure) exactly which parts of the boundary are assigned each type (velocity, wall, outflow)—the text is mostly clear but a schematic would help.
- **Validation:** 
   - Mention potential reasons for discrepancies between your data and Braza et al. (mesh resolution, turbulence modeling, difference in model assumptions, numerical schemes, etc.).
   - A little more discussion on the implications of the observed “slightly higher Cd” and “Cp closer to Re=20 than 40” would be valuable—are those differences expected, how might they be reduced?

### **3. Depth of Analysis**
- **Physical Interpretation:**  
   - Some results could use more narrative. For instance, what does it mean physically when the separation angle decreases with increasing Re? Why does Strouhal number behave as it does?
- **Conclusions:**
   - The conclusion is succinct, but could be strengthened by explicitly stating what the key learning or takeaway is for each major result (e.g., your reattachment length matches published work, but drag has a systematic offset).

### **4. Formatting and Presentation**
- Ensure all variables and equations are defined before use. In a couple of places, variables appear before their equations are presented (e.g., "St" before Equation 2).
- Number equations for clarity.
- Try to avoid starting sentences with figures and tables (e.g., “Figure 11: …”); instead, integrate or reference them smoothly within the narrative.
- Minor: If possible, align all figure captions below the figures for consistency.

## **Summary**

**Overall, this is a strong undergraduate research/report paper. It demonstrates technical understanding, follows best practices in CFD validation, and has a logical structure. By polishing the writing, clarifying boundary/condition choices, deepening the physical interpretation, and tightening comparisons with literature, you can further elevate this work.**
