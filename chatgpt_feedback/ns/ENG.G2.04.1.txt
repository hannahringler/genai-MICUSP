## Feedback on “What she’d have me be”: Reading Ruth in Webster’s “A Painter”

### **Thesis & Argument**

**Strengths:**
- Your thesis is clear: you challenge Angela Leighton’s reading by suggesting that the painter’s idealization of Ruth both evokes sympathy and masks a deeper displacement of blame for his artistic failure.
- You do an excellent job complicating the traditional reading of the poem by probing the ambiguous role Ruth plays, both as muse and scapegoat.

**Suggestions:**
- The thesis could be introduced with a slightly sharper focus in the opening. State sooner, perhaps in the first paragraph, that the paper will argue that the painter’s romanticization of Ruth is self-serving and masks his own responsibility.

---

### **Analysis & Close Reading**

**Strengths:**
- Insightful close readings of the text, especially the way you analyze diction (e.g., “wait,” “name”) and how the painter’s statements about Ruth are revealed to be self-centered.
- You effectively unpack the poem’s ironies and ambiguities, especially in analyzing the impact of the dramatic monologue form.
- The analysis of the repeated words “wait” and “name” is excellent and demonstrates a strong grasp of textual patterns and thematic resonance.

**Suggestions:**
- While your analysis is strong, be careful with longer block quotes—sometimes you quote at length, then summarize what’s just been said. Consider integrating shorter textual references more succinctly, and use block quotes only when you intend to parse them closely.

### **Organization & Structure**

**Strengths:**
- Overall, the paper is well organized, moving logically from a discussion of critical context (Leighton), to the painter’s relationship to Ruth, to the text's employment of monologue and language.
- Each paragraph topic is clearly signaled and supported.

**Suggestions:**
- The transitions between some sections—especially when shifting from general argument to very detailed close reading—can sometimes be abrupt. Try using explicit transitional sentences to clarify how each section builds on the previous one.
- The conclusion would benefit from a stronger final statement that synthesizes your points and suggests the poem’s broader implications (e.g., for reading Victorian gender roles, or for the genre of dramatic monologue).

---

### **Engagement with Scholarship**

**Strengths:**
- You thoughtfully engage with Leighton’s argument, acknowledging its value but critically extending/revising it. This creates a scholarly conversation rather than simply summarizing another critic.

**Suggestions:**
- It might be helpful to gesture briefly toward other possible critical angles (e.g., the tradition of dramatic monologue, gender studies, etc.), even if only in passing, to show your awareness of a wider critical context.

---

### **Clarity, Style, and Mechanics**

**Strengths:**
- Your prose is generally clear, fluid, and sophisticated.
- Vocabulary is appropriate for academic analysis, and your tone is formal yet accessible.

**Suggestions:**
- At times, sentences are quite long and complex, which can obscure your point. Try varying sentence length and breaking up run-ons for greater clarity.
- Proofread for small typographical or grammatical errors (“his that monologue” should be “his monologue…”).

---

### **Use of Evidence**

**Strengths:**
- You quote and refer to the poem effectively, supporting your points with precise evidence.
- The readings of poetic language, monologue structure, and gendered dynamics are rooted in textual specifics.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider including a bit more historical or biographical context (about Augusta Webster or the broader Victorian context of gender/family/art), if appropriate for the assignment, to reinforce your claims about society and gender.

### **Final Comments**

This paper provides an astute, nuanced, and original argument about Webster’s “A Painter,” and you demonstrate sophisticated skills of close reading and literary analysis. With some more explicit transitions, sharper signposting of your main thesis in the introduction and conclusion, and attention to paragraph and sentence structure, this could be an excellent paper for upper-division undergraduate or graduate coursework.

**Overall: Strong, thoughtful, and insightful interpretation with only small improvements needed for clarity and flow.**
