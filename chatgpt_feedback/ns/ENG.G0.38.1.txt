Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on your response paper about Roman Polanski’s adaptation of *Macbeth*:

---

### Strengths

**1. Clear Thesis and Focus:**  
You present a clear thesis early on, establishing that Polanski’s adaptation emphasizes Macbeth’s brutality and the consequences of ruthless ambition, setting up the analysis that follows.

**2. Insightful Analysis:**  
You thoughtfully compare Polanski's approach to other adaptations and Shakespeare’s original intentions, particularly regarding Macbeth’s inner torment. The distinction between spoken soliloquies and internal voiceovers is well observed and meaningfully connected to character interpretation.

**3. Use of Specific Examples:**  
You effectively use specific cinematic examples (e.g., the Banquo banquet scene, visual imagery like severed hands or corpses) to support your points. This evidence strengthens your arguments and shows careful viewing of the film.

**4. Engagement with Theme:**  
You demonstrate a deep understanding of the film’s thematic content, such as the consequences of ambition, the handling of guilt, and how these are visually presented.

**5. Strong Conclusion:**  
Your conclusion clearly restates your insights and summarizes the significance of Polanski’s choices, returning to your thesis and reinforcing your original claims.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Organization and Structure:**  
While your ideas are strong, some paragraphs would benefit from clearer topic sentences and transitions. For example, the paragraph about disturbing visual images could begin with a thesis statement summarizing what the paragraph will show, helping guide the reader.

**2. Clarity and Conciseness:**  
A few sentences are long and could be more concise or separated for clarity. For instance:

> “Many of MacBeth’s soliloquies express his inner torment and emotion so as to garner the favor of the audience. But in Polanski’s version, most of these speeches are inner monologues that are portrayed through voice over, so that it is obvious that these thoughts are only inside MacBeth’s mind, and are not intended for anyone else to hear.”

Consider breaking this up and tightening your prose, e.g.:  
“Shakespeare’s original soliloquies express Macbeth’s inner torment, eliciting sympathy from the audience. In Polanski’s film, however, these become silent voiceovers, highlighting that Macbeth’s remorse is private—and therefore less meaningful.”

**3. Interpretation and Evidence:**  
At times, you state effects or intentions without much elaboration (e.g., “By doing this, he overshadowed any goodness that Shakespeare may have originally intended for the play.”). Clarify what specific “goodness” you’re referring to, and provide a brief textual or scholarly point for comparison.

**4. Minor Grammatical Errors:**  
There are sporadic tense inconsistencies (“MacBeth is pronounced ‘prince’ by the rightful king” should probably be “MacBeth is named heir by Duncan”), and some awkward phrasings. Proofreading for such details will improve polish.

**5. Balancing Summary and Analysis:**  
You occasionally move into summary when analysis would be more effective, especially in scene descriptions. Always follow up a summary with explanation of its significance to your thesis.

### Style and Voice

- Your academic voice is confident and appropriate for an upper-level class.
- The inclusion of humor (e.g., “larger than life (or death, ha ha)”) is stylistically risky and, unless your professor encourages a conversational tone, might not be best in formal academic writing.

---

### Suggestions for Improvement

- **Revise for clarity and conciseness.**
- Use stronger topic sentences at the start of paragraphs.
- Introduce analysis before or after scene summary and connect examples directly to your thesis.
- Avoid injecting humor unless certain it fits the assignment’s tone.
- Proofread for grammar and phrasing.

**Overall,** this is an insightful and well-supported response that would benefit from minor tightening and more explicit organizational cues. Great job engaging with both the film and the play!
