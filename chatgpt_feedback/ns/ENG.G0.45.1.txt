Certainly! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper titled "Charity in the Character of Sir William Thornhill" examining Oliver Goldsmith’s *The Vicar of Wakefield*:

---

### Strengths

1. **Clear Thesis:**  
   Your argument is clear from the introduction. You assert that Sir William Thornhill is not as charitable or deserving of praise as most characters in the novel suggest. This focus is maintained consistently throughout the essay.

2. **Textual Evidence:**  
   You use direct quotations and specific references to the novel to support your points, which strengthens your argument and demonstrates careful reading.

3. **Logical Progression of Argument:**  
   The essay builds logically, moving from questioning Sir William’s charitable acts (or lack thereof), to his actions regarding the Primrose family, and finally to his inconsistencies and comparison with the Vicar. This progression helps the reader follow your critique.

4. **Critical Approach:**  
   You are not afraid to challenge the "surface" reading of a virtuous character, and you consider not only what Sir William does, but what he fails to do.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Introduction and Context:**  
   While your thesis is clear, your introduction would benefit from a little more context for readers less familiar with the novel. Briefly summarizing who the Primroses are and the general plot would help orient readers.

2. **Organization:**  
   The essay sometimes jumps between examples and analysis. Clearer topic sentences and organized paragraphs focusing on one aspect at a time (e.g., Sir William’s charity, then his actions with the Primroses, then his knowledge of Mr. Thornhill’s character) would help readability. Consider using stronger transitions between points.

3. **Depth vs. Repetition:**  
   Some arguments are repeated (e.g., Sir William could have prevented Olivia’s seduction in several different ways). Try to consolidate similar points to avoid redundancy and spend the additional space analyzing significance or counterarguments.

4. **Counterarguments:**  
   Acknowledging potential counterarguments in more depth would strengthen your analysis. For example, you mention the Primroses' own vanities, but you could consider whether Sir William has a reason for his restraint (e.g., upholding social norms, testing character, etc.) and then respond to these possible justifications.

5. **Proofreading/Clarity:**  
   There are minor grammatical errors and some awkward phrasings (e.g., "then is was too unkind a lesson"). A thorough proofreading would help polish the essay. Also, clarify ambiguous pronouns—for instance, when you say "he takes from them," immediately clarify that "them" refers to the Primroses.

6. **Conclusion:**  
   Your conclusion reiterates the argument but could be more impactful. Consider reflecting on how your argument alters a reader’s understanding of the novel, or what this suggests about Goldsmith’s intentions regarding charity and virtue.

### Additional Suggestions

- **Use More Secondary Sources:**  
   Aside from citing the primary text, integrating a scholarly source or two (if the assignment allows) could strengthen your critical context and show engagement with existing literary criticism.
- **Quote Framing:**  
   Sometimes quotations are dropped into the text without introduction. Frame each quotation by explaining why you are using it and what it demonstrates.
- **Character Motivation:**  
   Consider examining Sir William’s motives more deeply. Why might he choose not to reveal himself? Is there a larger satirical purpose to this restraint?
