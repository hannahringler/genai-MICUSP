Certainly! Here’s a detailed feedback on the paper, focusing on argumentation, structure, use of sources, textual analysis, originality, and clarity. I will balance strengths and areas for improvement, as would be helpful for a student or writer seeking to revise or polish their work.

---

## 1. Thesis & Argument

**Strengths:**
- The thesis is ambitious, nuanced, and thoughtful. You challenge a common interpretation of Locke, arguing convincingly that Locke’s “state of nature → property → government” sequence is not strictly linear or historical-material.
- Your central interpretive claim—that Locke structures the Treatise as an analogy to the development of a boy to manhood, rather than a socioeconomic historical progression—shows originality and creative engagement with the text.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The thesis could be stated even more clearly in the introduction. The first paragraph is a little dense, and the main claim is not immediately crystal clear ("Locke is appealing to a different sort of developmental process"). Consider leading with a more explicit summary: e.g., “I argue that Locke’s social and political contract is better understood as an analogy for individual maturation, not as a necessary historical-material progression driven by the rise of property.”
- Occasionally, the main argument gets a bit lost in lengthy passages of summary or citation. Periodically restate/refocus on how each section advances (or supports) your thesis.

## 2. Structure & Organization

**Strengths:**
- The paper is well-organized, moving methodically from Locke’s state of nature, to property, to commonwealth/government, then on to the analogy with maturity, and finally revolution.
- Pointed signposting (“At this point… I diverge from the common interpretation”) helps the reader follow your argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some sections, such as the property debate (pp. 4–10), are much denser and longer than others, potentially overbalancing the paper. Consider tightening summary/citation, and expanding analysis on the family, gender, and revolution (your most original contributions).
- Paragraph transitions could be crisper. Sometimes a new idea is introduced abruptly without linking back to the previous point.

## 3. Textual Engagement & Interpretation

**Strengths:**
- You engage deeply and carefully with Locke’s text, and are attentive to subtleties of his argument across different chapters.
- Good use of block quotations for textual support (though see warning below).
- You are careful to point out how Locke is misunderstood when his concept of “property” is overly narrowed or read out of context.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- There’s a risk of over-quoting. Some large block quotes (pp. 4–5, 9–10) could be summarized and only the most relevant parts quoted directly. This would help with flow and allow more room for your own interpretation.
- Make sure each quote is always closely tied back to your argument. At times, the discussion can veer into paraphrasing Locke (summary), when more analysis or critical distance (your own voice) would be stronger.

## 4. Use of Secondary Sources

**Strengths:**
- Good and economical use of Ashcraft’s work as a foil.
- Reliance on textual rather than only historical argumentation is a strength for an essay focused on close reading.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- You mention Ashcraft’s thesis mostly at the beginning and end. Perhaps weave it in again mid-paper (“This also complicates Ashcraft’s historical reading in the following way…”), showing more engagement with the critical debate.
- Integrating at least one other scholarly interpretation could strengthen your position or provide a further foil.

## 5. Originality and Critical Thinking

**Strengths:**
- The focus on the transition from child to adult as a metaphor in Locke is provocative and creative—much more interesting than simply restating standard readings.
- The discussion of the family and gender in Locke as an analogy or foundation for political society is a compelling critical insight.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Push this innovative reading more consistently. The paper’s most original claim (the “boy-to-man” analogy) sometimes takes a backseat to more standard analysis of property. Consider foregrounding this as the paper’s backbone.

---

## 6. Style & Clarity

**Strengths:**
- The writing style is generally clear, articulate, and scholarly.
- You correctly use period-appropriate pronouns when discussing Locke and are consistently attentive to distinctions (e.g., “property” as a term).

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The language is sometimes unnecessarily dense and could be made more concise and punchy, especially in topic sentences.
- Long, complex sentences can occasionally be confusing. Vary sentence length for readability.

---

## 7. Minor Points / Editing

- Double-check for grammatical errors and loose phrasing; e.g., minor typos in footnotes and parenthetical citations (“Lock” should be “Locke” in one instance).
- The bibliography could include full details for all works referenced, even if briefly.
- It’s common in academic writing—but try not to footnote quite so lavishly unless absolutely necessary.

---

# **Summary:**

**Overall, this is a strong paper: highly original, well-structured, and deeply engaged with Locke’s text.** Focus your revision on:
- Sharpening and foregrounding your thesis, giving the “boy-to-man” analogy pride of place.
- Streamlining your analysis of property (less summary, more pointed critique and connection to your analogy).
- Quoting more selectively and keeping your own voice central.
- Smoothing transitions and clarifying why each section matters for your overall claim.

**If you make these improvements, this would be an excellent, publishable graduate-level essay on Locke.**
