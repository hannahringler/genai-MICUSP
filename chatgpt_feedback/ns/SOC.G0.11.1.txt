Absolutely! Here’s some constructive feedback on the paper, highlighting **strengths** and providing **suggestions for improvement**:

---

## **Strengths**

**1. Clear Research Question and Hypothesis:**  
You clearly state your research question (“Are religious people more likely to be against abortion than non-religious people?”) and a corresponding hypothesis. This gives the paper a strong, focused foundation.

**2. Thoughtful Research Design:**  
- The use of semi-structured interviews is well-justified, especially given the sensitive nature of the topic.  
- The operationalization of “religiosity” and “feelings on abortion” is carefully considered.

**3. Honesty about Limitations:**  
- You are transparent about sampling limitations, potential response biases, and generalizability.  
- The paper addresses confounding variables (e.g., age), and you make a clear attempt to control for them in your analysis.  
- You correctly recognize that University of Michigan students are not nationally representative.

**4. Ethical Considerations:**  
You detail your informed consent process, steps to protect confidentiality, and ethical awareness concerning sensitive topics.

**5. Use of Data and Analysis:**  
- The paper includes relevant tables and statistical analysis (crosstabs, correlations).
- You recoded variables effectively to allow for clearer analysis, and your explanations are easy to follow.

**6. Self-Reflection:**  
You reflect on what didn’t go as planned and what you would change in future research.

## **Suggestions for Improvement**

**1. Sample Size and Diversity**
- **Issue:** The sample (N=25) is quite small, with limited representativeness across religion, region, social class, and age, as you note.
    - *Improvement:* For a more robust study, a larger and more varied sample would strengthen findings and allow for deeper subgroup analysis. Could you leverage online surveys to supplement in-person interviews? Or find ways to intentionally include more religious diversity (Jewish, Muslim, etc.)?

**2. Methodological Rigor**
- **Issue:** While semi-structured interviews are justified, coding open-ended responses introduces subjectivity.
    - *Improvement:* Consider using a codebook with clear, pre-established criteria and (if possible) have another researcher code a subset of responses for intercoder reliability. More detail on your coding process would strengthen the rigor.

**3. Depth of Analysis**
- **Issue:** The analysis is a bit surface level—mainly descriptive.
    - *Improvement:* Go beyond reporting percentages and weak correlations. Include more quotes from respondents to add qualitative depth. Try to interpret *why* the results come out as they do—what might explain, for example, that age confounds the effect of religiosity?

**4. Theoretical Framing**
- **Issue:** The paper would benefit from situating your research in a broader sociological context.
    - *Improvement:* Reference a few relevant scholarly sources, such as work on religion and morality, or on abortion attitudes. This could strengthen the literature review/background section.

**5. Clarity and Conciseness**
- **Issue:** Some paragraphs are lengthy and meandering, and there are a few redundancies.
    - *Improvement:* Aim for concise and direct writing. For example, combine related sentences, and trim details that don’t directly advance your argument.

**6. Statistics and Interpretation**
- **Issue:** The presentation of statistics is clear, but interpretation is lacking detail.
    - *Improvement:* Briefly explain what a correlation coefficient means and why a correlation of -.066 is “weak”/not significant, for readers less familiar with statistics.

**7. Further Discussion/Implications**
- **Issue:** The implications of your findings could be more fully developed.
    - *Improvement:* Discuss what your (even weak) findings mean for public debate, policy, or future research on abortion and religion.

| **Strengths**                             | **Areas to Improve**                 |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Clear research question & hypothesis      | Increase sample size/diversity       |
| Justified qualitative method              | Provide richer analysis, use quotes  |
| Transparency about limitations            | More theoretical/contextual framing  |
| Careful operational definitions           | Clarify and streamline writing       |
| Ethical attention                        | Explain statistics in plain English  |
| Use of basic statistics                   | Discuss implications more            |

## **Overall Impression**

This is a thoughtful, honest, and clear undergraduate research paper. It is strongest in its self-reflection and careful methodology. With more depth in analysis, increased sample representativeness, a tighter connection to scholarly literature, and stronger articulation of findings/implications, it could be further improved. Good work!
