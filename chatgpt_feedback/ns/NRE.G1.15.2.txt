Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on your paper about integrated assessments for messy (wicked) environmental problems:

---

### Strengths

**1. Clear Structure and Criteria**
- The paper is well-organized, following a logical structure with clear headings: **Adequacy, Value, Legitimacy, and Effectiveness**. This makes it easy to follow your arguments and see how each concept relates to integrated assessment.

**2. Use of Case Studies**
- Referencing real-world cases (Gulf of Mexico hypoxia, Global Warming, Cod Fishery) makes the discussion concrete and engaging. These examples help illustrate the challenges of applying theory to practice.

**3. Theoretical Foundation**
- You show strong understanding of relevant concepts, such as Sarewitz’s Five Myths of Science, Pasteur’s Quadrant, Scheffer’s ecological complexities, and the governance triangle. This demonstrates depth and breadth of knowledge.

**4. Realism and Caution**
- The memo does not sugarcoat the difficulties of integrated assessment in real-world decision making. It addresses political, social, and scientific complexities honestly and directly—a practical approach that decision makers will appreciate.

**5. Balanced Tone**
- You commend the audience’s intent and encourage learning from past mistakes as well as successes. The memo strikes the right tone for a policy- or decision-maker audience—thoughtful, balanced, and constructive.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Clarify and Tighten Some Sections**
- At times, sentences are long and could be broken up for clarity. For example:  
  *“This was largely a result of Sarrewitz’s Five Myths of Science; since many stakeholders viewed science in terms of these myths (especially as inherently authoritative), they interpreted small uncertainties (i.e., the possibility that phosphorus may contribute to hypoxia) as a lack of credible information.”*  
  → Consider simplifying:  
  *“Many stakeholders viewed science as inherently authoritative (Sarrewitz’s Myth), so even small uncertainties—such as whether phosphorus contributes to hypoxia—were seen as undermining the credibility of the data.”*

**2. Connect Themes More Directly to Recommendations**
- You discuss the problems well, but more explicitly stating what the decision maker should do would be stronger. For instance, after discussing legitimacy problems in the Cod Fishery, outline concrete actions to make the process more legitimate (e.g., transparent criteria, truly participatory processes, independent oversight).

**3. Define Jargon for General Readers**
- While you are likely addressing a knowledgeable audience, it would help to briefly define terms like “Pasteur’s Quadrant,” “RISAs,” or “scheffer’s ecological complexities” in a phrase, so all readers are on the same page.

**4. Strengthen Concluding Recommendations**
- You conclude with general hopes for learning from strengths and weaknesses, but you could finish with 2–3 actionable lessons or takeaways. For instance:
  - **Acknowledge Uncertainty:** Don’t let lack of perfect data prevent action.
  - **Prioritize Stakeholder Engagement:** Build trust by ensuring all voices have real input.
  - **Focus on Usability:** Deliver both broad and regionally relevant findings for policy makers.

**5. Flow and Transitions**
- Sometimes section transitions are abrupt. Adding a brief linking statement at the start/end of each section would help maintain flow (e.g., “Beyond adequacy, the perceived *value* of assessment information is equally important…”).

### Minor Suggestions

- **Typo:** In your closing paragraph: “before you being to address”—should be *begin*.
- **Voice:** In places, you use passive or indirect phrasing. Whenever possible, favor active voice for confidence and clarity.
- **Examples:** When referencing “marginal victories,” provide a concrete example for each case if space allows.

### Overall Impression

This is a strong, thoughtful, and well-informed memo that addresses the real complexities of integrated assessments for wicked environmental problems. With a little tightening and explicit actionable recommendations, it would be even more valuable to decision makers. Excellent work!
