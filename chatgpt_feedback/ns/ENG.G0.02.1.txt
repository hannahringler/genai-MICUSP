Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, **"The Vicar of Wakefield as a Failed Morality Story"**.

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Clear Thesis Statement**
Your thesis—that *The Vicar of Wakefield* fails as a Christian morality story because its characters' actions and the plot contradict traditional Christian morals—is clearly stated and well-argued throughout the essay.

### 2. **Contextualization**
You effectively set the stage by referencing *Everyman* and *King Lear*, situating *The Vicar of Wakefield* within the broader tradition of English moral literature. This gives your argument a strong foundation.

### 3. **Textual Evidence**
You use relevant quotes and plot details from *The Vicar of Wakefield* to support your points (e.g., the family's love of finery, Moses' gullibility, Olivia running away). This demonstrates close reading and textual engagement.

### 4. **Comparative Analysis**
Your essay draws productive contrasts between *The Vicar of Wakefield* and earlier morality tales, helping to clarify not just how, but **why** Goldsmith’s novel is different.

### 5. **Insight into Social Change**
You touch on the historical and social context—such as the rise of the middle class and shifting ideas about reciprocity, wealth, and education—which helps explain changes in literary morality. This is sophisticated literary analysis.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Organization & Structure**
- **Transitions:** Some paragraphs feel a bit abrupt. Adding clearer topic sentences or transition phrases could help the essay flow more smoothly from one point to the next.
- **Paragraph Focus:** A few paragraphs try to cover multiple examples or ideas at once, making them hard to follow. Try to keep each paragraph focused on a single main idea.

### 2. **Depth of Analysis**
- **Moral Complexity:** While you point out places where *The Vicar of Wakefield*’s morals are conflicted, you could analyze more deeply **why** Goldsmith might intentionally complicate or subvert simple Christian morality (e.g., satire? commentary on contemporary society?).
- **Narratorial Irony:** You note the narrator’s “judgmental air,” but could engage further with the possibility of irony—does Goldsmith intend us to see the vicar as unreliable or foolish in his moralizing?

### 3. **Textual Evidence**
- Sometimes claims about the characters (for instance, that the wife is “more conniving than pious”) could use more specific textual evidence, perhaps a short direct quote or pointed reference.
- You could make better use of *Everyman* and *King Lear* by bringing in illustrative quotes from those works as well.

### 4. **Counterarguments**
- Consider addressing why some might see *The Vicar of Wakefield* as a successful morality story. This would let you refute those points, strengthening your argument.

### 5. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion reiterates your thesis but could be stronger by reflecting on the implications of your argument—for example, **what does the failure mean for the evolution of morality in English literature?**

### 6. **Minor Issues**
- **Typos & Grammar:** There are minor errors (e.g., "or not necessarily Christian" should be "are not necessarily Christian"; “merit have wealth,” should be “merit having wealth”). Proofreading could help here.
- **Citation:** Make sure direct quotes are always fully cited (page numbers are sometimes missing).
- **Works Cited:** The citation for Goldsmith’s novel reads “The Vicar of of Wakefield” (minor typo).
