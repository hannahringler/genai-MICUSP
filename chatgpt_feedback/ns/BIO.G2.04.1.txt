Absolutely! Here is a structured feedback review of your research paper, "Polyphyly of the Old World Vultures and phylogenetic placement of Gypohierax angolensis (Aves: Accipitridae) inferred from mitochondrial DNA." I'll address strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions for revision.

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Topic Relevance and Significance**
- The paper addresses an interesting and significant question in avian phylogenetics — the evolutionary relationships within Old World vultures and the placement of Gypohierax angolensis.
- The focus on mitochondrial DNA, cytochrome b (cyt b), and robust phylogenetic methods is up-to-date and aligns well with the field’s norms.

### **2. Literature Review**
- You provide a thorough summary of previous hypotheses regarding Old World vulture phylogeny, citing important prior work and alternative views.
- The context is clear: readers understand why the placement of Gypohierax is uncertain and controversial.

### **3. Methods and Analyses**
- Modern laboratory techniques (Qiagen DNEasy, PCR, sequence alignment, model-based phylogenetics) are concisely described.
- Use of both parsimony and Bayesian inference gives the results added robustness.

### **4. Clear Reporting of Results**
- The paper summarizes key findings: evidence for polyphyly, detailed clade relationships, and statistical support for those relationships.
- There is some discussion of codon bias, which adds depth to your molecular analysis.

### **5. Credible Use of Citations**
- Key literature in both molecular systematics and vulture biology are cited. This demonstrates good scholarship.

## **Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

### **1. Structure and Organization**
- The **Introduction** and **Methods** are clearly separated, but the **Results** and **Discussion** often blur together. Try to keep factual reporting in Results, and interpretive/causal statements in Discussion.
- The very **first page** is a to-do list rather than part of the paper; consider whether you want to include it, and if so, reframe it as a "Supplementary Materials" or at the end for transparency.

### **2. Clarity and Conciseness**
- Some sentences are overly complex or ambiguous. For example: “The phylogenetic placement and evolutionary history of Gypohierax is unclear” could be expanded to clarify *why* it's unclear, or what traits are in conflict.
- There are some typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., “anlyses” for “analyses”, “Gyophierax” for “Gypohierax”). Consistency in spelling and careful proofreading is needed.
- Terms like "derived" could be clarified, especially for a broader audience.

### **3. Data Presentation**
- Although you describe phylogenetic results, the text references Figures ("Figure 1") and Tables ("Table 1"), but these are absent from the provided text. These should be included for clarity.
- Similarly, a tree diagram summarizing your main Bayesian and parsimony findings would be easier for readers to interpret than text alone.

### **4. Depth of Discussion**
- The Discussion does a good job tying findings to the literature, but could probe further: 
    - What is the biological meaning of early divergence of Gypohierax, Gypaetus, and Neophron?
    - What morphological or ecological traits may support/reject your molecular findings?
    - Are there limitations or caveats? (e.g., limited taxon sampling, only mitochondrial data used).

### **5. Methods Details**
- More detail could be given about data treatments (how were ambiguous bases handled?), software versions for all analyses, and more about the models used (e.g., GTR+Γ+I?).
- Give sample sizes and genetic coverage. For instance, how many individuals per species? Only mtDNA, or any nuclear genes?

### **6. Formalities and Style**
- Always use complete scientific names (e.g., genus + species) on first mention.
- Italicize Latin species names consistently.
- Consistent formatting for references (double-check capitalizations, italics, etc.).
- Avoid casual phrases in formal writing (e.g., “see what happens to new guinea harpy”).
