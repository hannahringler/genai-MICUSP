Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback review of your essay on “Human-Animal Nature in H.G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe.”

**Strengths**

1. **Clear Thesis & Focus:**  
   Your introduction makes a clear, original argument about the shared and divergent perspectives on human and animal nature in both *The Island of Dr. Moreau* and “The Black Cat.” You anchor the essay well by identifying cruelty against animals as the underlying force for each character's downfall.

2. **Evidence & Analysis:**  
   You quote directly from both texts and offer specific page references, which strengthens your analysis. You tease out key moments—Moreau’s remorselessness, Poe’s narrator’s “perverseness”—to illustrate how both justify and then pay for their cruelty.

3. **Comparative Structure:**  
   The essay does a good job paralleling both works, moving between Poe’s narrator and Moreau with clear connections. You examine not just what they do, but also their attitudes, justifications, and the consequences, which deepens your analysis.

4. **Insight on Setting:**  
   Noting that the contrasting settings (the island versus the city) have no bearing on the outcome strengthens your thesis about cruelty as the overriding factor. This is a thoughtful touch.

5. **Writing Style:**  
   Your prose is clear, mostly concise, and maintains an academic tone. Topic sentences guide the reader through your argument.

**Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

1. **Depth of Textual Engagement:**  
   While you explain each protagonist’s mindset, you could further unpack how these perspectives are shaped by broader context—social, scientific, or psychological. For example, how does Victorian-era science influence Moreau? How does the Gothic tradition inflect Poe’s depiction of guilt and conscience?

2. **Analysis of Remorse:**  
   You claim that “remorse” (and its absence) differentiates the characters, but you could clarify how remorse (or lack thereof) fundamentally affects the fate of each. Is Moreau’s lack of remorse more damning? Does Poe’s narrator’s remorse invite reader sympathy, or make his actions more chilling? Explore this nuance more.

3. **Integration of Quotes:**  
   Some quotations feel dropped into the prose rather than integrated. Try to “sandwich” quotes: introduce them, present them, then interpret them directly. E.g.,  
   Instead of:  
   >...since “the study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature” (Wells 115).
   
   Try:  
   > As Wells suggests, “the study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature” (115), indicating that Moreau sees his own detachment as a scientific necessity rather than a personal failing.

4. **Broader Implications:**  
   The essay could offer a final reflection: what larger message do these texts convey about human/animal boundaries? Do these stories urge us to reconsider our treatment of animals today, or are the authors more concerned with human psychology? A brief concluding paragraph could ground your findings in a broader literary or ethical context.

5. **Small Points:**
   - Typo: It's “Edgar Allan Poe,” not “Allen.”
   - There’s some repetition in how you describe the main points—condense for conciseness.
   - “Pluto’s reincarnation” is more metaphorical than literal; clarify to avoid confusion.
