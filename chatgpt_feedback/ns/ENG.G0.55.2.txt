Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper about the illustrations in *Persepolis* by Marjane Satrapi. I’ve organized my feedback into three sections: strengths, suggestions for improvement, and specific notes about argumentation and style.

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Strong Introduction:**  
   You begin with a clear statement of your initial skepticism, which invites readers into your thought process and gives the essay a personal touch. This draws your audience in and establishes your perspective.

2. **Critical Engagement:**  
   You demonstrate engagement with multiple scholarly perspectives (Naghibi, Tensuan, Whitlock), analyzing the text through formalist and Marxist critical lenses. This indicates a good understanding of literary criticism.

3. **Thesis and Focus:**  
   Your thesis is clear: the graphic novel format of *Persepolis* enhances rather than diminishes its complexity and meaning. You refer back to this point consistently throughout the paper.

4. **Textual Evidence:**  
   You provide specific references to both the text and images in *Persepolis*. Concrete examples (such as depictions of the veil and the comparison of public/private moments for women) effectively support your analysis.

5. **Clarity in Argument:**  
   You articulate how the graphic form is a means of resistance and how it serves to cross cultural, linguistic, and political boundaries.

### **Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Structure & Organization:**  
   – At times, the flow between paragraphs could be improved. Consider signposting at the start of paragraphs to make transitions smoother (e.g., “Another example of visual resistance can be seen when…”).  
   – Organize your critical perspectives more clearly: perhaps start with formalist arguments (Naghibi and Tensuan) in one section and then transition to the Marxist/global accessibility perspective (Whitlock).

2. **Depth of Analysis:**  
   – You make strong claims about the effects of visuals versus text. At times, you could delve deeper into *how* specific artistic choices (black-and-white color palette, facial expressions, panel layouts) create specific emotional or intellectual effects.  
   – Consider discussing visual metaphors, repetition, or the use of negative space in particular panels to further evidence your analysis.

3. **Counterargument:**  
   – You briefly mention “some may argue that the use of graphics is a way to dumb the book down,” but you could strengthen your essay by directly addressing a counterargument in more detail and rebutting it with evidence.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   – Your paper would benefit from a more developed conclusion that summarizes your main points and reiterates the significance of your argument, perhaps by connecting it to the broader question of what counts as “literature.”

### **Argument & Style Notes**

- **Voice and Tone:**  
   Your tone is academic but remains readable and personable—which works well for this kind of analytical essay.

- **Quotations:**  
   Citations are well-integrated, but sometimes they’re a bit extended; a few shorter quotations with more analysis would be more effective (the block quote from Tensuan, for example, is long and could be broken up).

- **Grammar/Word Choice:**  
   Generally strong, though there are occasional informal phrases (“dumb the book down”) that could be replaced with more formal language (“oversimplify the narrative”).

- **Works Cited:**  
   Excellent inclusion of a works cited section; make sure it fits the required citation style for your course (MLA, APA, etc.).

### **Overall Evaluation and Suggestions for Revision**

This is a thoughtful, well-supported analysis that demonstrates careful reading and understanding of Satrapi’s *Persepolis*. By sharpening the structure, deepening the textual analysis, and engaging more directly with opposing viewpoints, your essay could move from strong to excellent.

**Next Steps:**  
- Clarify the organization of critical perspectives.  
- Zoom in on a couple of panels for close “reading.”  
- Expand your conclusion.  
- Consider a clearer, more formal academic style in a few places.
