Absolutely! Here is a detailed, constructive critique of your paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

---

### **Strengths**

**1. Clear and Relevant Research Question**  
Your central research question is timely and focused: *What impact did the rise of political activity on the Internet have on Democratic victories in the 2006 midterms?* You effectively contextualize the importance of the Internet in political change.

**2. Comprehensive Literature Review**  
You thoroughly cover significant theories in political participation—distinguishing between individually- and externally-motivated participation, cost/benefit analyses, and classical and contemporary scholarship. The inclusion of Gladwell's work and Web 2.0 indicates you are thinking creatively and interdisciplinarily.

**3. Good Use of Sources**  
Your references to leading scholars (Rosenstone & Hansen, Verba & Nie, Krueger, Gladwell, O’Reilly) are well-chosen and give your review academic heft.

**4. Identifies Gaps in Literature**  
You clearly point out that less has been written about the effects of blogs and Web 2.0 on political participation, which establishes a solid rationale for your research.

**5. Logical Organization**  
The paper is easy to follow, with headings and transitions that guide the reader through your argument logically.

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Research Design is Underspecified**  
While your introduction and literature review are excellent, the "Research Design" element of your title and purpose is not addressed in detail. How, specifically, will you empirically assess the blogosphere’s impact? Will you use case studies, interviews, content analysis, or quantitative data?  
*Suggestion:* Add a section outlining your methodology, data sources, case selection, and method of analysis.

**2. More Direct Ties Between Literature and Your Case**  
You do a great job explaining theories, but you could more clearly tie these back to the 2006 election and to *blogs* specifically. For example, can you cite data or studies about blog readership, fundraising, or influence in 2006?  
*Suggestion:* Integrate more empirical examples or cite preliminary data where possible to make the link to 2006 more explicit.

**3. Balance Between Description and Argument**  
Much of the review summarizes various theories; the paper could be even more compelling if you preview your own hypothesis or take a stronger argumentative stance, e.g., “I expect that the Netroots did contribute substantially to X, Y, and Z, for reasons A, B, and C.”  
*Suggestion:* End your literature review with a set of hypotheses or clearly stated expectations derived from the scholarship.

**4. Minor Issues with Clarity and Redundancy**  
There is a bit of repetition (for example, cost/benefit discussion recurs in several sections), and occasionally the prose is wordy.  
*Suggestion:* Read over the draft to streamline redundant explanations and tighten sentences for clarity.

**5. Limited Attention to Counterarguments or Alternative Explanations**  
You focus on the democratizing potential of the Internet but could more explicitly address critiques—e.g., echo chambers, digital divide, or evidence that traditional mobilization still dominates.  
*Suggestion:* Briefly discuss alternative views and how your research will address or control for these.

### **Summary**

**Overall, your paper demonstrates impressive command of the literature, a clear research gap, and a strong grasp of theoretical debates in political participation.**  
- To further strengthen it, flesh out your research design, tie scholarship more directly to your empirical case, state your hypothesis/expectations, and acknowledge alternative explanations.

**If you need, I can help you draft a methods section or give examples of how to tighten or strengthen your argument. Let me know if you’d like that!**
