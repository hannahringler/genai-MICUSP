Absolutely! Here’s feedback on your paper by section, covering argument, analysis, structure, clarity, and style. I’ll provide both strengths and suggestions for improvement, with an overall assessment at the end.

---

**Strengths**

**1. Engagement with Sources and Arguments**
- You provide a thorough overview of Pascal’s Wager and Schlesinger’s defense, as well as the mercenary objection and the "essence of religion" criticism.
- Use of relevant supporting quotations shows careful reading of both primary and secondary sources.
- The engagement with C.S. Lewis and Samuel Butler adds philosophical and literary depth.

**2. Analytical Depth**
- You do not take Schlesinger’s argument at face value; instead, you critically evaluate both the philosophical and psychological sides of the objections.
- The discussion of true religious belief versus mere intellectual assent is nuanced, and you engage with the tension between seeking truth versus seeking benefit.

**3. Structure and Flow**
- The paper is generally well-structured: it introduces Pascal’s Wager, discusses common objections, outlines Schlesinger’s responses, and then offers your own critical evaluation.
- Paragraphs flow logically, with clear topic sentences and transitions that guide the reader.

**4. Originality and Insight**
- The point about belief as more than intellectual assent, and the need for genuine engagement with truth, is well put.
- Your reflection on Pascal’s possible intentions regarding audience and motivational appeals is thoughtful.

**Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

**1. Clarity and Conciseness**
- Some sentences are wordy or convoluted, making your argument harder to follow. For example:  
   > "His argument that an appeal to greed is acceptable could be strengthened, and he fails to adequately account for how the bettor acquires genuine belief in God, which, I will argue, is necessary to the essence of religion."  
   Consider breaking complex sentences into parts for clarity.
- Sometimes the transitions between your analysis and quotations are abrupt; add more signposting (“This shows that…”, “However,…”).

**2. Integration of Citations**
- Although you cite well, sometimes it interrupts the flow. Where possible, weave citations into the text more smoothly.
- E.g. “As Schlesinger notes, this objection ‘has no great logical force but carries considerable psychological weight’ (83).”

**3. Addressing Counterpoints**
- You mention a slippery slope (“every act that fulfills some wish is selfish”), but the rebuttal could be stronger. Spell out why this is/might be a slippery slope fallacy, or suggest a different line of critique.
- Consider engaging more directly with potential responses from Schlesinger or defenders of Pascal—what would a theist say to your points about belief and the love of truth?

**4. Depth on ‘True Belief’**
- Your analysis of belief vs. action is important, but you could briefly address philosophical literature on belief formation (for instance, William James or contemporary epistemology). What are the mechanisms by which someone might come to believe through pragmatic action? Is there psychological evidence?
- Your claim that “love for the divine is not the same as belief in the divine” could be expanded—do they overlap? Are they mutually dependent? Justify this key point a little further.

**5. Conclusion**
- The paper ends strongly, but it would help to have a dedicated conclusion paragraph that synthesizes your critique and restates the significance of your argument.

**6. Minor Style & Formatting**
- Some typographic artifacts (e.g., “MICUSP Version 1.0…”) are distracting—remove these for final drafts.
- Ensure consistent tense and viewpoint.

**Overall Assessment**

You present a nuanced, sophisticated critique of Pascal’s Wager and Schlesinger’s response, combining detailed engagement with sources and insightful analysis of the nature of belief. Your structure is clear, and you show philosophical maturity in weighing the psychological against the epistemic dimensions of religious belief.

**Main areas to improve:** clarity of sentence structure, deeper exploration of the belief/action link, and a clear conclusion. With these refinements, your argument will stand out even more.

**Grade Estimate (if requested):** High B+ to A- range, depending on course expectations and rubric.
