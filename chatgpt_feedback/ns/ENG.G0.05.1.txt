Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback breakdown for your paper, based on content, organization, use of evidence, style, and mechanics:

## Overall Feedback

### Strengths

**1. Clear Thesis & Focus:**  
Your thesis regarding the treatment of daughters as property or objects in both *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* and *Hamlet* is clearly articulated from the start. The essay maintains a focused argument throughout, returning consistently to the topic of filial obedience and objectification.

**2. Effective Use of Evidence:**  
The paper provides ample, relevant quotations from both plays. The textual evidence is well-chosen and effectively supports your interpretation of these daughter-father relationships.

**3. Comparative Analysis:**  
You do a strong job drawing parallels between Hermia and Ophelia’s experiences, as well as highlighting the differences, particularly in how the genre of each play (comedy vs. tragedy) affects the women’s ultimate fates.

**4. Interpretation & Insight:**  
The essay shows a nuanced understanding of both texts and Shakespeare’s depiction of gender and power. Your analysis considers not just the characters, but the broader societal and legal frameworks influencing them.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Organization & Flow:**  
The essay is generally well-organized, but transitions could be smoother, especially between the two main case studies. For example, after discussing Hermia, a brief transition paragraph summarizing her situation and signaling the shift to Ophelia would help the paper’s readability.

**2. Thesis Implied, Not Always Restated:**  
While the introduction lays out your main argument, consider restating your thesis more explicitly in the conclusion. This will reinforce your central claim for the reader.

**3. Engagement with Secondary Sources:**  
Your analysis is strong, but you reference only the plays themselves. Engaging—even briefly—with a scholarly perspective on Shakespeare’s treatment of women or father-daughter dynamics could deepen your analysis and demonstrate broader engagement with the critical conversation.

**4. Subtlety of Language:**  
At points, your analysis could benefit from a little more nuance or qualification. For example, rather than stating unequivocally that Hermia and Ophelia are “dehumanized and commodified,” you might acknowledge moments where their individuality surfaces, or hint at potential resistance, however limited.

**5. Mechanics/Proofreading:**  
- There are a few small typographical errors—e.g., 'chose' should be 'choose'.
- Be consistent with possessives and titles (e.g., "A Midsummer Night’s Dream" throughout).
- Remember to italicize play titles in formal writing.

**6. Conclusion:**  
Your conclusion effectively summarizes your analysis, but it might be strengthened by commenting on the significance of these patterns in Shakespeare—why do these recurring dynamics matter, both in his own time and now?

## Some Specific Suggestions

- **Transition Example:**  
  After the first major section on Hermia, try including a sentence like:  
  “While Hermia’s fate is decided within the bounds of Athenian law and custom, Shakespeare explores similar dynamics of parental control and limited female autonomy in *Hamlet*, albeit under different circumstances and with a far more tragic outcome for his heroine.”

- **Thesis Reminder in Conclusion:**  
  Consider ending your conclusion with a sentence linking your comparison to a broader theme in Shakespeare’s work or in early modern society.

- **Works Cited Format:**  
  Ensure MLA (or your required style) consistency for your “Works Cited” section.
