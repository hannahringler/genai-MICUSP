Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, **“Acid Mine Drainage: Effects and Possible Solutions.”** The feedback covers organization, clarity, argument strength, use of sources, and areas for improvement.

---

## Overall Strengths

### 1. **Clear Structure**
- The paper follows a logical structure: Introduction, Literature Review, Discussion/Analysis, and Conclusion.
- The inclusion of an **abstract** is helpful and outlines the paper’s focus well.
- Each section has a defined purpose and addresses key aspects of AMD (Acid Mine Drainage).

### 2. **Use of Examples**
- Real-world cases (Berkeley Pit, Pennsylvania streams) give the paper depth and demonstrate the seriousness of AMD.
- Specific chemical reactions and their effects are included and explained, demonstrating your understanding of the scientific basis.

### 3. **Balanced Approach**
- The paper discusses both the environmental effects and the economic considerations of AMD remediation.
- Solutions for both old and new mines are considered and compared.

### 4. **Use of Sources**
- The paper references a mix of primary and secondary literature, including academic works and reputable websites.
- Citation of direct examples, like Bucknell’s paint from yellowboy and the failed economic attempt at Berkeley Pit, illustrates points effectively.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Thesis Clarity and Purpose**
- The thesis—that economic accountability and prevention are best for AMD—is clear, but could be stated more assertively in the introduction and reinforced throughout.
- The abstract and introduction sometimes blend; consider keeping the abstract concise and using the introduction to more clearly frame your argument.

### 2. **Transitions and Flow**
- Some transitions between sections feel abrupt. For example, the switch from chemical processes to environmental effects and then to economic solutions could be made smoother.
- Try summarizing the key findings of each section before moving to the next.

### 3. **Depth of Analysis**
- **Cleanup Solutions:** The discussion of cleanup methods could benefit from clearer comparison. A table or direct comparison (pros, cons, costs, effectiveness) would help.
- **Profit Potential:** Expand on why profit-driven cleanup isn’t currently economical and what factors (technology, market, policy) could change that.
- **Regulation & Prevention:** More detail on *how* governments can hold companies accountable (bonds, fines, monitoring) would strengthen your recommendations.

### 4. **Use of Sources & Citations**
- Reliance on Wikipedia is seen as less rigorous in academic writing; use it sparingly or to triangulate more reliable sources.
- Ensure you consistently cite all facts and claims.
- Update references where possible; some are quite dated (1994, 1996). This material may still be relevant, but referencing more recent studies would strengthen the work.

### 5. **Grammar and Style**
- Occasionally, sentences are long and could be more concise. Example:  
  *“AMD is a naturally occuring process that is a byproduct of weathering of rock (Kesler, 1994).”*  
  Consider: “AMD naturally occurs as rocks weather, but its effects are much more severe with mining activity (Kesler, 1994).”
- Proofread for typos (“occurring” not “occuring”; “arsenic” not “aresenic”; “Clark Fork River” not “Clark Ford River”).

### 6. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion reiterates main points but could more strongly advocate your preferred solution.
- Consider a “call to action” or a statement about the implications of inaction/policy inertia.

## Final Recommendations

- **Sharpen your thesis and make it a through-line for your entire argument.**
- **Expand the analysis**—especially on why certain methods are not economically feasible and how governance can drive better outcomes.
- **Polish language** for conciseness and correct typos.
- **Update references** and minimize reliance on Wikipedia.

Overall, you display good understanding of the issues and possible solutions regarding AMD. With some focused revisions, you can make your paper more authoritative and impactful!
