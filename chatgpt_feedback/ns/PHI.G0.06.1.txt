## Feedback on “Examining Socrates’ Desire Theory”

### Strengths

**1. Clear Structure and Organization**
- The paper is well organized: you state from the outset that you will explain and evaluate Socrates’ argument, discuss its implications, and explore problems with the view. Your organizational sign-posting helps the reader follow your analysis.

**2. Accurate Summarization**
- You ably summarize Socrates’ position in the *Meno*, laying out the four categories (A)-(D) with clarity. Your paraphrasing of Socrates’ assumptions and main goals shows a solid grasp of the text.

**3. Thoughtful, Relevant Critique**
- The example with Grace is both original and persuasive. You use this thought experiment to suggest a counterexample to Socrates’ assumption that no one wants to be unhappy—a creative and effective move.
- You engage with the philosophical stakes, especially regarding akrasia (weakness of will) and point out real-life counterexamples, e.g., dieting, procrastination, addiction. This grounds your analysis in practical human experience.

**4. Attention to Clarity**
- Good clarification that Socrates means "no one wants what they believe to be bad," not just "no one wants what is bad," which demonstrates careful engagement with the argument's phrasing and possible misreadings.

### Suggestions for Improvement

**1. Deepening Philosophical Engagement**
- *Grace Example*: While Grace appears to want to be unhappy, a Socratic might reply that she only does so because she perceives a temporary benefit (e.g., processing grief, honoring her feelings). Consider preempting this response: is there a “good” she mistakenly believes in, or is the case a true counterexample?
- *Akrasia*: You note that Socrates denies akrasia, but it might be helpful to distinguish more sharply between what a person desires in the short term (immediate pleasure, relief) versus long-term goods (health, virtue). You could ask whether Socrates' "what one believes to be best" is about overall or momentary good, and whether this helps or hurts his argument.

**2. Citational Precision and Philosophical Context**
- When you mention, “Plato is aware...he addresses this in the Republic, by dividing the soul into parts,” briefly explain how this division modifies or rejects the desire theory presented in the *Meno*.
- You reference specific passages ("77c-77d", "78")—this is good. Consider standardizing your citation style throughout for professionalism.

**3. Engaging with Alternatives or Secondary Literature**
- While this may not be required, you could briefly mention that many philosophers after Plato (Aristotle, contemporary philosophers) have discussed and criticized Socrates’ view here—showing awareness of the broader debate would deepen your analysis.

**4. Style and Polishing**
- The writing is generally clear, but a few sentences are long and could benefit from being split. For example:  
  > "It does not make sense to say that a person did something he did not want to do. Even if he did not perhaps desire to do this or that particular action, he desired for the state of affairs brought about by that action to obtain."
  Try: “It does not make sense to say someone did something they did not want to do. Even if the person did not desire the particular action, they may have wanted the outcome the action produced.”
- Try to use gender-neutral pronouns where possible ("they" rather than "he").
- Proofread for minor redundancies and awkward phrasing, e.g., “What is troublesome about Socrates’ view is that it does not seem to accurately describe…” could be more concise: “Troublingly, Socrates’ view does not seem to accurately describe…”

### Summary

**Overall, this is a well-argued, clearly written, and thoughtful paper.** You demonstrate a strong understanding of Socrates’ view and raise a compelling challenge to it using both philosophical and real-world examples. With a bit more engagement with possible Socratic replies and a touch more precision/context, your analysis would be even stronger. Well done!

**If you’re revising:**  
- Deepen your counterexample analysis, anticipating and addressing Socratic replies.  
- Explain the connection to Plato’s tripartite psychology a bit more.  
- Smooth out a few sentences for readability.

*Grade Estimate (if requested):* A- / B+ (depending on course standards, would go up with deeper philosophical pushback and polish).
