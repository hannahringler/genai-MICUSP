Absolutely! Below is detailed feedback on your essay comparing Hermia in *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* with Jessica in *The Merchant of Venice.* I’ll address strengths, organization, argumentation, evidence, style, and offer suggestions for improvement.

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Thesis and Structure:**  
   Your introduction sets up a clear thesis: that Jessica’s defiance of her father is more severe (and “successful,” depending on how success is defined) than Hermia’s. The organization follows this thesis logically: first, comparing relationships, then specific acts of defiance, and finally, the consequences for each woman.

2. **Close Reading and Evidence:**  
   You provide strong textual evidence throughout, including well-chosen quotes from both plays. Your commentary demonstrates an attentive reading, especially in distinguishing the extents and outcomes of defiance.

3. **Engagement with Definitions:**  
   The use of the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of “defy” adds a thoughtful dimension and complexity to your analysis by foregrounding interpretation and criteria for “success.”

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Thesis Clarity and Consistency:**  
   Your thesis evolves over the essay, shifting from “Jessica is more successful (in terms of rebellion)” to “Hermia is more successful (in terms of happiness).” While this is a legitimate development, you might clarify earlier that the essay will interrogate what ‘success’ truly means in this context, and that your conclusion will challenge a simplistic equation of defiance with success.

2. **Organization and Transitions:**  
   The essay moves logically through its points, but the transitions between sections could be smoother. For example, when shifting from Hermia's actions to Jessica’s, use linking sentences to remind readers how each point connects to your central argument.

3. **Depth of Character Analysis:**  
   While Jessica’s motivations are explored, the essay largely assumes her actions are cruel without much complexity—e.g., her “vindictiveness” in pawning the ring. Could her actions be seen as a desperate assertion of autonomy, given her oppressive environment? Similarly, more could be said about why Hermia is “less severe” in her rebellion—is it just temperament or also circumstance?

4. **Addressing Counterarguments:**  
   The essay could briefly acknowledge alternative interpretations—e.g., some critics see Hermia’s defiance as radical in its own way, given the mortal stakes she faces. Or, is Jessica’s “cruelty” understandable, even sympathetic, given her context? Addressing this would enrich your argument.

5. **Conclusion Development:**  
   Your conclusion raises a thought-provoking point: if happiness not rebellion is the best metric, Hermia’s path is “more successful.” Expand on this a bit more! Why might Shakespeare have wanted to show us these two contrasting outcomes? Is there a broader lesson about the nature and price of rebellion in patriarchal societies?

6. **Citation and Academic Conventions:**  
   While you cite lines and acts, be consistent with your citation style and clarify the first time which edition you’re using (MLA, for example). Also, italicize play titles throughout for consistency (*A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, *The Merchant of Venice*).

7. **Sentence Structure and Word Choice:**  
   Overall, your writing is clear, but occasionally wordy (“Hermia’s defiance as less severe and more sympathetic than Jessica’s” could be “Hermia’s defiance seems less severe and more sympathetic…”). Consider tightening sentences for conciseness and clarity.

**Summary:**  
This is a strong, well-organized, thoughtful paper that demonstrates a good grasp of the plays and the prompt. To take it to the next level, clarify your thesis earlier, engage more deeply with character motivations and possible alternate readings, and polish your organization and citations. Well done!
