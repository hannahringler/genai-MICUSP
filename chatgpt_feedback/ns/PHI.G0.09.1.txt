Absolutely! Your paper provides a clear, structured analysis of Kant’s arguments about the a priority and intuitional nature of space in the *Transcendental Aesthetic*. Below, I’ll give feedback on several fronts: clarity and structure, philosophical sophistication, engagement with scholarship, argumentation, and suggestions for improvement.

---

## **1. Clarity and Structure**

**Strengths:**
- The essay is clearly organized, signposting each major argumentative stage (Kant’s first and second arguments for the apriority of space, responses and objections, and finally the argument for space as intuition).
- Each paragraph flows logically to the next, and you effectively break down complex material into digestible parts.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Occasionally, the summary of arguments (especially Kant’s own formulations) could be even more condensed—sometimes the paraphrasing is a bit close to the original and could be more succinct.
- Consider including a brief roadmap or thesis in your introduction to let the reader know both *what* you will argue and *how* you will structure your discussion.

## **2. Philosophical Sophistication**

**Strengths:**
- You demonstrate a strong grasp of Kant’s arguments and concepts, particularly the distinction between intuition and concept.
- Critiques drawn from Allison and Parsons show engagement with major secondary literature, and you respond thoughtfully to each.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- At times, your treatment of objections remains at the level of summarizing the literature. It would strengthen your paper if you more explicitly took a stand on the objections (“I find Allison’s reading ultimately unconvincing because…”) and gave your own reasons.
- In the final sections, don’t just state that a conclusion “must hold” or “is clear”—take the time to articulate *why*, in your view, that is the case, explicitly and in your own words.

## **3. Engagement with Scholarship**

**Strengths:**
- Appropriate and well-chosen use of Allison and Parsons.
- Good critical use of footnotes to clarify sources and secondary debates.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Consider mentioning at least in passing some broader context—why are these discussions about space as intuition or as a priori important for Kant’s project overall? How does this relate to later philosophy or to other discussions within the *Critique*?
- You mention Daniel Warren’s critique—briefly elaborating on his central point (even in a long footnote) would increase accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the literature.

## **4. Argumentation**

**Strengths:**
- You are very good at reconstructing arguments in premise-conclusion form.
- Your assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of both Kant’s and his critics’ arguments is mostly fair and even-handed.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- After exploring critiques (like Parsons’ point about psychological versus logical possibility), try to be more decisive: Is this a fatal flaw, or merely a weakness? What might Kant say in reply?
- When you claim that “at least one of the conclusions must hold,” clarify your logical reasoning—can both premises actually be false, or is it just that both cannot *simultaneously* be false?

---

## **5. Suggestions for Improvement**

- **Introduction:** Add a short paragraph stating your main aim and how you’ll proceed. Is your overall judgment that Kant’s arguments succeed, fail, or do something more subtle?
- **Conclusion:** Consider a brief concluding paragraph that reflects on the upshot. For example: “While Kant’s arguments for the a priority and intuitional nature of space face serious challenges, they remain influential for their insight into the structure of human experience. Further exploration might address...”
- **Original Voice:** While your summary and engagement with the literature shows understanding, strive to make your own viewpoint most prominent in each section (“I conclude that…” or “This suggests that, for Kant,…”).

## **Summary**

This is a strong undergraduate philosophy paper: clear, technically competent, engaged with key secondary literature. With more explicit argumentation, a stronger authorial voice, and slightly more context-setting for Kant’s wider project, you could push it to the next level. Keep up the good work!
