Absolutely! Here’s a structured feedback tailored for an upper-level graduate nursing paper, grounded in the content you provided. I’ll address **content, structure, clarity, evidence, and areas for improvement**.

### Overall Impression

This paper represents a thoughtful and well-structured proposal for evaluating the effectiveness of standardized nursing terminologies in electronic medical records (EMRs) in the context of surgical patients. The literature review is thorough, the rationale is clear, and the proposed research model is methodologically sound and well-justified. The use of a quasi-experimental design is appropriate given the limitations of randomization in real clinical settings.

## Strengths

**1. Relevance and Rationale**
- The introduction effectively establishes the increasing importance of outcomes research in health care, especially in measuring patient care quality and safety.
- The focus on surgical patients is justified using statistics (SCIP), raising the urgency of the research.
- The link between standardized nursing terminology, better communication, and potentially improved outcomes is well articulated.

**2. Literature Review**
- Multiple studies are cited to demonstrate gaps in existing research.
- You distinguish between research on electronic documentation broadly and the more specific topic of standardized nursing vocabularies.
- Identifies both benefits and limitations found in prior research, which supports the need for your proposed model.

**3. Conceptual Model & Research Design**
- Clear definition of study population, setting, and intervention.
- The proposed use of HANDS and standardized vocabularies (NANDA, NOC, NIC) is appropriate and current.
- Rationalizes why a quasi-experimental design is preferable over RCT in this context, noting selection bias but also steps to minimize it.

**4. Outcomes and Measures**
- Outcome measures are practical and relevant (surgical site infection prevention, myocardial protection).
- Applies existing, reputable data sources (SCIP database).
- Operationalizes outcomes using measurable proxies (e.g., beta-blocker administration, normothermia).

**5. Limitations**
- The paper is transparent about the limitations of process measures versus true outcome measures.
- Acknowledges issues with follow-up after discharge and proxy outcomes.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Clarity & Conciseness**
- Some sections could be more concise. For example, the explanation regarding pediatric patients could be shortened.
- Occasional sentences are complex and could be simplified for clearer communication.

**2. Depth of Analysis**
- While you acknowledge limitations, you might go a step further by suggesting how future studies might address these (e.g., linkage with external databases for longer-term outcomes).
- Consider providing brief strategies to mitigate the limitations (e.g., supplementing the study with follow-up phone calls to patients after discharge).

**3. Integration of Literature**
- Some studies (like Allen, 1998) are described, but their relevance to the proposed model could be more explicitly tied back—how exactly does the finding support your model or point to a gap?
- Consider synthesizing the literature into more of a narrative, noting trends and controversies, not just listing studies.

**4. Methodological Detail**
- Add more detail to your data analysis plan. For example, do you plan to control for confounders beyond those mentioned (age, elective status)? Will you conduct sensitivity analyses?
- Expand on how “the presence of the relevant NANDA diagnosis” could be tracked as a secondary variable.

**5. Visual Aids**
- The appendix/model diagram is a good start but could be more visually engaging. Consider a flowchart demonstrating the intervention, communication process, and expected outcomes.

**6. Referencing and Writing Formality**
- The referencing is correct, but watch out for minor inconsistencies (e.g., use of “!” for beta-blockers—likely a typo).
- Ensure you’re using a consistent tense throughout (past vs present).
- Proofread for occasional grammar/wording glitches (e.g., “paucity of studies of sufficient methodological rigour”—is excellent, but elsewhere, you have sentence fragments).

**7. Conclusion**
- The conclusion could be slightly stronger. Beyond sparking “more discussion,” briefly state potential impacts or next steps if the model is validated.

**Final Comments**:  
This is a strong graduate-level work, showing deep understanding of the field and critical engagement with the literature. With a bit more focus on integrating literature, expanding methodological detail, and enhancing the clarity and visual appeal, this proposal would be even more robust. Excellent job overall!
