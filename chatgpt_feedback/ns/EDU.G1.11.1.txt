Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on the paper **"Content, Context, and Purpose: Rethinking Academic Writing About Sexualized Violence"** (MICUSP, Education, Graduate Proposal):

---

**Overall Impressions**
This is an ambitious, well-conceived, and thoughtfully-structured research proposal addressing an important and underexplored topic: how women write about sexualized violence in academic settings, and how educational environments respond to such writing. The rationale is sound, the literature review is thorough, and the research design demonstrates sensitivity and reflexivity.

Below are strengths and areas for improvement, as well as suggestions for enhancement:

---

### Strengths

1. **Clarity & Rationale**
   - The overview clearly frames the gap in current knowledge and justifies why this research is necessary.
   - The focus on not pathologizing survivors’ writing is timely and relevant.

2. **Literature Review/Framing**
   - The literature review is comprehensive and well-integrated. It draws on foundational work (Caruth, Herman, Felman & Laub, etc.) and recent scholarship, situating your study within debates over trauma, representation, and pedagogy.
   - The inclusion of feminist pedagogy and consideration of genre theory/critical theory is strong.

3. **Research Questions**
   - The main research questions are clearly articulated and address the “what, why, how, when, where, and to whom” of student writing on sexualized violence. This layered approach ensures depth.

4. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Excellent attention to ethics, including voluntary participation, confidentiality, member-checking, and trauma-informed approaches. The focus on empowerment is commendable.

5. **Methods**
   - The mixed-methods approach using essays, interviews, and focus groups is appropriate.
   - Allowing participants to choose their preferred method of engagement (focus group or interview) is both ethical and practical.

6. **Reflexivity**
   - You are explicit about your positioning and conscious of bias. The plan for a research journal is a good practice in reflexivity.

7. **Appendices/Protocols**
   - The appendices are well done and the interview protocols are open-ended, encouraging narratives rather than forced answers.

### Areas for Improvement & Suggestions

1. **Aims & Contributions**
   - The aims could be more succinctly articulated in the introduction. Consider stating in one or two sentences what new knowledge or practice your study will enable for educators.
   - The “pedagogical model” you hope to theorize could be outlined more specifically, even if tentatively, rather than only at the end.

2. **Scope**
   - The study is limited to female undergraduates, which is justifiable, but the rationale could acknowledge non-binary and trans students who may also experience high rates of sexualized violence.

3. **Theoretical Integration**
   - While the literature review is excellent, aim to integrate the main theoretical perspectives more clearly into the research questions and methodology sections. How will genre theory, feminist pedagogy, and trauma theory shape your analytic choices? Explicitly linking them would strengthen the conceptual coherence.

4. **Methodological Details**
   - Explain your plan for ensuring analytical rigor in more detail—for example, how will you code and analyze themes across different data sources?
   - Consider how you will handle conflicting or divergent narratives from the interviews/focus groups.
   - Address possible power imbalances in the focus group (e.g., some voices dominating conversation) and how you will mitigate this.

5. **Risk & Safeguards**
   - You mention risks of harm, but it would be beneficial to clarify the procedure if a participant becomes distressed (e.g., options for counseling referral).
   - Specify how you will handle disclosures of ongoing abuse, given your duty of care.

6. **Generality/Transferability**
   - The implications for other institutions could be further discussed. How might findings transfer (with limitations) beyond Michigan?

7. **Language**
   - Some sentences are quite long and complex. Aim for occasional sentence variety/shorter sentences, especially when conveying methodological steps or ethical safeguards.
   - In places, “sexualized violence” might be unclear to those outside specific academic circles; a note on its use (as you do in the footnote) could be up front in the text.

8. **Participant Involvement in Analysis**
   - Member-checking is great, but clarify what input participants will have on interpretation—are they co-analysts or reviewers?
   - Will they have a say over direct quotes being used (and if so, what’s the process for that)?

---

### Minor Notes

- Proofread for small redundancies (occasional repetition of points about confessional vs. therapeutic writing, etc.)
- The reference list is thorough and well-styled.
- Consider including a proposed timeline for the study (rough timeframes for each phase).

### Summary

**This is a thoughtful and ethically-minded research proposal with clear awareness of complexity and sensitivity. With some tightening of aims, further methodological detail, and deeper integration of theory-method links, the proposal will be even stronger.** You are well-positioned to make a valuable scholarly and pedagogical contribution!
