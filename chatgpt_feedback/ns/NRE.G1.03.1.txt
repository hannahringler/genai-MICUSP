Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper about the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis):

---

### Strengths

**1. Clarity and Structure:**  
Your paper is well structured: it guides the reader logically from the introduction and discovery of the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) to its detection, control, and impacts. This makes the paper easy to follow.

**2. Comprehensive Coverage:**  
You provide a detailed overview, including the biology of EAB, how it was introduced to Michigan, the progression of infestation, detection challenges, and implications for both the environment and economy.

**3. Use of Sources:**  
You cite relevant research and expert opinions appropriately, strengthening your arguments. Your literature cited section is solid and shows a good breadth of research.

**4. Integration of Evidence:**  
You use specific numbers (e.g., 15 million trees dead or infested, $1.7 billion projected loss), which helps illustrate the magnitude of the problem and supports your points well.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Thesis & Focus:**  
Your thesis could be stronger. The introduction sets up the topic well, but it would be clearer with a more direct statement of what the paper will show or argue (e.g., how and why EAB infestation occurred in Michigan and the effectiveness of control techniques).

**2. Synthesis and Critical Thinking:**  
While the paper summarizes sources well, there could be more synthesis or critical analysis. For example, you could discuss which control methods seem most promising, or what has (or hasn’t) worked so far and why. You might weigh the pros and cons of different approaches, or highlight gaps or uncertainties in current research.

**3. Flow and Transitions:**  
Some paragraphs could use smoother transitions. For example, between the ecological impacts and the economic ones, guide the reader more explicitly (“Not only are ecological impacts serious, but economic consequences are also far-reaching…”).

**4. Minor Language and Stylistic Issues:**  
- Some sentences are long and a bit unwieldy. Try breaking them up for readability.
- Watch for minor typos (“less then 50m” should be “less than 50m”; “Planipennis” should be italicized when referring to the species name).
- There are occasional awkward phrases (“it is not through woodlots that A. planipennis became established…” could be simplified for clarity).

**5. Conclusions and Restoration:**  
Your conclusion is optimistic and forward-looking, but could say a bit more about what specific steps you recommend or what you see as the most urgent research priorities.

**6. Visual Aids:**  
The inclusion of a map is good, but you could describe or refer to it more in the main text (“As seen in Figure 1…”), and consider if any other figures or tables would help (e.g., lifecycle chart, control methods summary).

### Minor Suggestions

- Briefly explain scientific or forestry terms that a general reader might not know.
- If space allows, briefly discuss management strategies from other regions or any lessons learned from international experience with EAB.
- Strengthen your opening and closing sentences for each section for emphasis and summarization.

**Overall Grade:** Very Good  
You clearly understand the topic and cover all required aspects. With slight refinements to synthesis, flow, and style, your paper will be even stronger and more compelling.
