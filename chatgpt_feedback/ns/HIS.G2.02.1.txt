Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, structure, clarity, and suggestions for improvement.

---

### Strengths

**1. Breadth and Depth of Research**
- Your paper demonstrates an impressive command of the core literature of whiteness studies. You engage many significant texts, from Roediger’s *Wages of Whiteness* to Gordon’s *The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction*, and situate them within important scholarly debates.
- You go beyond mere summary, wrestling with the arguments and the implications for working-class studies.

**2. Analytical Rigor**
- You offer nuanced evaluations of each author's main arguments, carefully considering the strengths and shortcomings of their approaches.
- Your distinction between race, color, ethnicity, and the “spectrum of whiteness” reflects a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of these terms.

**3. Organization**
- The structure (Introduction, thematic sections, Conclusion) is logical and clear, with each section building upon the previous.
- Clear topic sentences and transitions help guide the reader through the analysis.

**4. Use of Evidence**
- You draw appropriately from both primary and secondary sources, showing you understand how historians construct arguments.
- When critiquing authors, you reference specific points of evidence (or lack thereof) from their works.

### Weaknesses / Areas for Improvement

**1. Argument and Original Contribution**
- One area that could be improved is your own *thesis* or original contribution. You review others’ arguments very well, but your stance is not always fully clear.
    - For example, you often ask, “what does ‘whiteness’ accomplish as an analytical concept that ‘racism’ does not?” but your own answer remains somewhat tentative.
    - Consider presenting your own position more explicitly in the introduction and returning to it in the conclusion.

**2. Critical Engagement**
- At times, your critiques are implied rather than fully developed:
    - When you note Guglielmo’s “top-down” account of color ascription, are you suggesting that bottom-up approaches might be more accurate or useful? Expand on the consequences of this methodological difference.
    - When referencing the code-word theory or Durr’s analysis, clarify your reasoning for favoring one interpretation over another.

**3. Clarity and Conciseness**
- While your writing is generally clear, some sentences are very long and convoluted, which may make your argument harder to follow.
    - E.g., "In privileging whiteness as the condition to which all people aspire, scholars such as those discussed in this paper ignore the possibility that in some contexts, non-white racial identities might also possess social and material advantages.”
    - Try breaking longer sentences into shorter ones and defining complex concepts more clearly as you go.

**4. Repetition and Redundancy**
- You return multiple times to the question of the relationship between whiteness and racism, sometimes repeating similar points.
    - Instead, summarize your views on this key issue once, and refer back to it concisely as needed.
- Several times you mention the potential of local case studies. Since this is a major theme, you could make this more explicit in your framework.

**5. Editing and Formatting**
- There are occasional typographical errors from numbering and source references. Be sure to edit for consistent formatting.
    - Ensure in-text citations use a uniform style.

**6. Scope**
- While your engagement with the concept of whiteness and its alternatives is strong, you might also consider referencing more recent developments in critical race theory, intersectionality, or globalization, given your conclusion’s call for expansion.

### Specific Suggestions

1. **State Your Argument Early**: In the introduction, clarify not just what you will review, but what *you* think about the field. Insert a sentence with your unique take.
2. **Tighten Language**: Revise paragraphs for conciseness. For example, use shorter sentences and avoid passive constructions.
3. **Synthesize More in Conclusion**: Rather than mostly summarizing the field, end with a clear statement of what your review shows and where you think research *should* go.
4. **Integrate More Original Analysis**: Pause after reviewing each text to offer your own perspective or explicitly relate it to your central question.
5. **Clarify What “Whiteness” Offers**: Since you ask what “whiteness” does that “racism” doesn’t, make sure that your answer—to the extent possible—is concrete. You touch on this in the section about religion, gender, region, etc., but try to crystallize it into a clear takeaway.

### Example of Stronger Thesis Statement

Instead of:  
> “This paper will examine seven books engaged in the whiteness debate (some more explicitly than others), primarily from the perspective of working-class studies.”

Try:  
> “By comparing major works in whiteness studies, especially through the lens of working-class history, I argue that the concept of whiteness—rather than simply substituting for racism—offers a uniquely flexible framework for understanding how race, class, gender, religion, and geography intersect to shape social hierarchies, but that its continued value requires greater attention to local context and to the agency of non-white groups.”

### Overall Evaluation

**This is a thoughtful, well-researched, and well-organized graduate-level essay.**  
With a clearer statement of your own contribution, a bit more synthesis, and some streamlining of your prose, it will be even stronger. The paper demonstrates deep engagement with major scholarship in the field and shows real intellectual maturity in grappling with its debates.
