Certainly! Here is detailed feedback on the paper, considering its **strengths**, **areas for improvement**, and **suggestions** for further development:

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Clear Research Question & Hypothesis:**
   - The paper starts with a well-structured introduction, clearly stating the research question: whether individual or social variables are the primary predictors of suicide rates. The hypothesis is distinctly formed within a well-established theoretical framework (functionalist tradition).

2. **Engagement with Literature:**
   - The literature review effectively summarizes different theoretical perspectives, drawing on both classic and contemporary sources, and highlights the debate between social structure and individual agency.

3. **Systematic Methodology:**
   - The use of secondary data and clear descriptions of what each table analyzes (race, insanity, alcoholism, marital status, national citizenship, and religion) shows a systematic approach. The paper also effectively distinguishes between individual and social variables.

4. **Logical Organization:**
   - The paper’s structure is logical, moving from introduction and literature review, through methodology and results, to discussion.

5. **Integration of Data & Theory:**
   - There is consistent reference to sociological theories and an effort to interpret empirical findings using those frameworks. The discussion reasonably interprets the results in line with the research question and functionalist theory.

6. **Acknowledgement of Limitations:**
   - The paper acknowledges some methodological limitations (e.g., correlation ≠ causation; the simplification of race).
   
7. **Proper Citations and Use of Academic Tone:**
   - The work uses proper citations for referenced authors and maintains a suitable academic tone throughout.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Data Presentation & Interpretation:**
   - While the results are described in detail, the actual tables and figures are summarized more than analyzed. More statistical rigor (even just basic percentages or graphs, since this is undergrad work) would help clarify claims about "no correlation" or "significant differences."
   - Occasionally, claims about “no correlation” are made, but quantitative evidence (correlation coefficients or even clearer narrative descriptions of the data) would strengthen the argument.

2. **Causality vs. Correlation:**
   - You correctly note correlation is not causation, but at times the paper takes a strong position (“X is a predictor of suicide rates”) that reads as causal rather than associational. Be cautious with language, perhaps hedging with “associated with” or “marks a significant correlation with.”
   
3. **Depth of Theoretical Engagement:**
   - The paper primarily uses Durkheimian/functional assumptions. While this is appropriate, it would be interesting to at least briefly mention possible counterarguments — for example, interactionist perspectives, or ways in which agency and structure may interact.

4. **Complexity of Variables:**
   - The operationalization of variables such as “race” and “national citizenship” is simplistic (which you acknowledge). Perhaps suggest concrete ways these could be more precisely measured or discuss intersectionality (e.g., how race and social integration interact).

5. **Addressing Anomalies:**
   - The finding that married men aged 16-25 have higher suicide rates deserves a bit more exploration — are there broader studies supporting this anomaly? Could there be other unmeasured variables involved?

6. **Broader Implications/Future Directions:**
   - The discussion could be strengthened by considering the social policy implications of your findings, or how future research might address your study’s limitations (e.g., suggesting longitudinal or mixed-method approaches, or international comparisons).

### **Suggestions for Revision**

1. **Add more statistical detail** to the description of results, even if only percentages, differences, or simple graphs.
2. **Be explicit about limitations** not just in the methodology, but also in interpreting results (e.g., acknowledging unmeasured confounding variables).
3. **Deepen the theoretical analysis** by briefly considering alternative frameworks, or integrating critiques of functionalist assumptions.
4. **Clarify the significance** of your findings for policy, practice, or future research at the end of your discussion.

### **Overall Assessment**

This is a well-structured, clearly written undergraduate research paper with a solid grasp of sociological theory and secondary data analysis. The main opportunities for improvement are increasing statistical rigor, deepening theoretical discussion, and reflecting more critically on the complexity of the variables and the limitations of your conclusions.

**Grade (if requested):** High B+ to low A, depending on the grading standards at your institution.

**Summary Sentence:**  
A thoughtful and well-organized analysis that persuasively supports the claim that social variables are stronger predictors of suicide rates than individual-level ones, but which could be further strengthened with more statistical detail, nuanced theoretical engagement, and a fuller discussion of methodological limitations.
