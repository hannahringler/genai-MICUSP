Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, “The Portrayal of Menstruation in Ulysses: Commentary on Sensationalism, Confinement, Realism and Intimacy”:

---

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Thesis and Focus:**  
   Your introduction lays out a complex and compelling argument about how menstruation in *Ulysses* is used to interrogate and subvert traditional constructions of femininity and realism. The thesis is clear and tightly woven throughout.

2. **Sophisticated Literary Analysis:**  
   You adeptly discuss Joyce’s differing narrative techniques in relation to Gerty, Molly, and Bloom, showing strong textual analysis skills (e.g., your points on narrative distance, prose style, and internalization of cultural materials).

3. **Engagement with Feminist and Cultural Issues:**  
   The paper situates literary devices within broader questions of gender, religion, and social norms, demonstrating keen awareness of both text and context. Your focus on the machinery of consumer culture and the Church’s role in shaping female identity is particularly insightful.

4. **Close Reading and Use of Evidence:**  
   You make effective use of short, relevant quotations and analyze them with specificity, especially regarding language and euphemism. Your reading of narrative slips and the significance of euphemism in “Nausicaa” is nuanced and well-argued.

5. **Comparative Structure:**  
   Structuring your analysis around the progression from Gerty’s sections to Molly’s works well to show contrasts and similarities. The sections on “Circe” and “Penelope” are nicely juxtaposed.

6. **Strong Conclusion:**  
   Your ending neatly circles back to your opening themes, emphasizing how sensationalism and ordinariness both serve to challenge norms and foster intimacy.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Paragraph Structure and Transitions:**  
   Some paragraphs, especially those rich in quoted material, become long and dense. Try breaking them up for greater clarity and to help the reader follow your argument step-by-step. Also, occasionally, transitions between points could be smoothed out with more explicit linking sentences.

2. **Engagement with Scholarship:**  
   The analysis would benefit from engaging more directly with existing critical voices on *Ulysses* and menstruation, or at least briefly referencing some feminist criticism or narrative theory to situate your argument within established debates. Even brief allusions to critics (e.g., Sandra Gilbert, Julia Kristeva, or Karen Lawrence) would add weight.

3. **Clarifying Argument Ownership:**  
   Sometimes you use phrasing like “Many argue...” or “It is plausible that...,” which weakens the authority of your own reading. Instead, clearly own your analysis, stating “I argue...” or “This essay contends…”

4. **Handling of the Hallucinatory:**  
   You mention that “Circe” is “hallucinatory,” but more could be made of this: what does it mean for resistance to only happen in hallucination? Are there implications about the limits of subversion in real space for women in the novel? A bit more development here would give this section more depth.

5. **Quotations and Source Attribution:**  
   While you do quote extensively from *Ulysses*, and attribute with page numbers, for clarity in academic writing, consider using a consistent citation style (MLA, Chicago, etc.), and if this was for a class, a bibliography might be expected—even if mostly primary.

6. **Minor Editing:**  
   Watch for small grammatical errors and typos (“Readers ask asked to probe...”) or phrases that are slightly awkward (“she isn’t corroborating with her own narration” → “she isn’t collaborating with her own narration” or “her narration does not corroborate her internal reality”). A quick proofread would resolve most of these.

7. **Concision:**  
   Some sentences could be made more concise for clarity and impact, particularly in the analytical sections.

**Overall Impression:**

This is an excellent, thoughtful, and ambitious essay! It demonstrates a mature grasp of both novelistic technique and feminist criticism, and your structure—moving from “Nausicaa” through “Circe” to “Penelope” via the motif of menstruation—proves highly effective in illuminating Joyce’s radical realism and interrogations of gender. With a bit more engagement with secondary criticism, tighter paragraphing, and some proofreading, this could easily be a paper at the higher end of undergraduate work, or even graduate level.

**Grade Estimate:** (If requested): A– or A
