Absolutely! Here is a detailed review and feedback on the essay “Embodied Normality and Embodying Socialism: Sex Education for Girls in East and West Germany in the 1970s”.

## Strengths

### 1. **Impressive Breadth and Depth of Research**
- Your essay demonstrates excellent command of both primary and secondary sources.
- The references to cutting-edge historiography (Herzog, Heineman, Schissler, Foucault, etc.) signal engagement with major debates relevant to gender, sexuality, and post-war German history.
- The bibliographic apparatus is exceptional—thorough, varied, and well-integrated into your analysis.

### 2. **Nuanced Comparative Analysis**
- You succeed in providing a fine-grained comparison that avoids caricature or simplistic East/West binaries.
- The analysis consistently distinguishes not only between the outcomes but also the intellectual and institutional *logic* of each system.
- Recognizing the limits and paradoxes within each regime (e.g., “quadruple burden” in the GDR, “equal but different” in the FRG) gives the essay balance and sophistication.

### 3. **Strong Theoretical Framework**
- The use of Foucault and newer cultural history approaches is effective and doesn’t overwhelm the empirical material.
- Concepts like “normalization,” “embodied subjectivity,” and “sexual citizenship” are introduced and developed in ways relevant to your argument.

### 4. **Clear Structure**
- The essay follows a logical progression: after an extensive introduction, discussion is segmented into focused sections (discipline and normalization, femininity, sexuality, pleasure, embodiment, and finally subjectivity).
- The use of headings (and effective topic sentences) helps orient the reader.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Signposting and Summation**
- While your introduction is thorough, the main argument is a bit diffuse. Consider more clearly stating the central thesis *up front* (in one or two crisp sentences).
- Periodic reminders or restatements of your main point, especially at the start or end of major sections, would help the reader keep track of your analytical thread.

### 2. **Voice and Style**
- The essay, while scholarly, can be dense and sometimes overly cautious in its phrasing (e.g., “perhaps,” “I would suggest,” “I think…”). In the main body, it’s effective to be less hedged: make assertive, evidence-backed claims.
- Some sentences are lengthy and packed with clauses—occasionally making meaning harder to parse. Consider breaking up long sentences, especially when introducing new concepts or evidence.

### 3. **Integration of Primary Sources**
- Although you reference and quote the sex education materials, more consistent use of *specific illustrative examples* (e.g., particularly salient images, phrasing, or anecdotes from the textbooks) would enliven and ground your analysis.
- Consider including very short translated quotes (with page numbers) to put the reader inside the material and show, not just tell, how these sources framed femininity and sexuality.

### 4. **Discussion of Reception/Impact**
- The essay focuses mostly on intended messages/theoretical frameworks, with less attention to reception: how were these texts received? To what extent did youth or parents comply, subvert, or ignore official norms?
- You *do* mention empirical data in passing (e.g., orgasm rates, knowledge from youth magazines), but this could be worked into the main analysis more systematically.

### 5. **Treatment of Homosexuality and “Deviancy”**
- You note the virtual absence or pathologization of homosexuality but this could use a more robust tie-in to the broader logic of each state system, especially considering conversations about exclusion, silence, and heteronormativity.

### 6. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion does a good job recapitulating main points, but could be a bit more synthetic or “forward-looking.” Are there broader implications for the study of sexuality, state power, or gender history suggested by your findings? Even one or two sentences projecting outward to wider debates (or to the post-1990 period) could strengthen the close.

## Minor Points

- Watch for typos and phrasing quirks (e.g., “coital,” “Hausfraulichkeit”)—occasionally they break up the flow for a non-specialist.
- Be sure to translate and gloss central German terms clearly for all readers.

## Overall Assessment

**This is a graduate-level essay that stands out for its research depth, conceptual sophistication, and clear engagement with historiographical debates.** With some smoothing of prose, a sharpened central thesis, and more sustained use of primary source evidence, it could easily serve as the backbone of a publishable article. You articulate the stakes of the East/West comparison, recognize complexity within each system, and make a persuasive case for the importance of sex education as a window on wider struggles over gender, modernity, and state power.

**Would highly recommend continued work in this direction!**
