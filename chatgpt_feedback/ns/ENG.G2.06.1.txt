Certainly! Here is a detailed feedback on “Jews in the New York Harbor: The Border Crossing in Antin, Roth and Levinson.” This feedback addresses **strengths**, **areas for improvement**, and **suggestions for revision**.

---

### **Strengths**

#### 1. **Strong Introduction and Thesis**
- The paper opens with an engaging personal quotation from Kazin, which immediately draws the reader into the emotional and symbolic resonance of immigration.
- The introduction lays out both the scope (Antin, Roth, Levinson) and the central concern: the symbolic and performative importance of the New York harbor in Jewish American literature/film.

#### 2. **Sophisticated Theoretical Framing**
- The discussion picks up on theories of performativity (Bourdieu, Austin) and myth-making in national/ethnic identity.
- The analysis goes beyond summary, interrogating how each author/filmmaker uses the border crossing as both a literal and metaphorical scene — this is a nuanced approach.

#### 3. **Well-chosen Primary Sources**
- The progression from Antin (early 20th-century optimism and advocacy), Roth (modernist individual trauma), to Levinson (postmodern nostalgia and the fading of memory) is effective.
- The comparisons across time periods are insightful and help build a larger historical argument.

#### 4. **Close Reading**
- The paper includes strong close readings of moments in Antin’s, Roth’s, and Levinson’s work, showing how each manipulates the cultural conventions and imagery of arrival.

#### 5. **Awareness of Historiography and Memory**
- The discussion with Hasia Diner’s work shows awareness of major secondary scholarship.
- The paper is attentive to the difference between “historical experience” and “collective memory”—a key issue in studies of immigration.

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### 1. **Organization and Transitions**
- While the structure follows a logical progression (Antin → Roth → Levinson), transitions between sections can sometimes be abrupt—especially at the start/end of major sections.
- Ensure that at the start and end of each section, there is a strong signpost relating the part to the overall thesis.

#### 2. **Depth vs. Breadth**
- At times, the paper offers broad survey statements (e.g., about the political climate, generalizations about American myth-making) that could be more tightly focused or evidenced.
- The section on Antin, in particular, could feature a deeper textual analysis of a particular passage or moment, rather than a summary.

#### 3. **Engagement with Counterarguments**
- The essay would benefit from briefly anticipating counter-arguments. For instance: Antin’s use of patriotic imagery—are there dissenting readings? Does the Jewish experience always “erase” religious aspects? Are there scholars who disagree with the notion of the harbor as central?

#### 4. **More Direct Analysis in Places**
- Sometimes, the argument is phrased passively or indirectly (“one could argue,” “perhaps,” “maybe”). Aim to make direct, assertive claims.
- Some close readings (particularly in the Roth section) verge on plot summary rather than analysis of narrative technique or language.

#### 5. **Conclusion Could Be Stronger**
- The conclusion is thoughtful but could be condensed and made more assertive. Right now, it circles around potential future research without clearly stating what this paper’s own contribution is.
- Try to end by succinctly restating your main findings (what *specifically* does your paper add to the study of Jewish American literature and the harbor crossing motif?).

### **Minor Points/Editing**

- Proofread for occasional grammatical issues (e.g., verb tense, word choice: “ensure” vs. “insure,” “conventions...have shored up” is a confusing metaphor).
- Citations: Ensure uniformity/consistency in citation style (sometimes the in-text citations are a bit uneven).
- Some paragraphs are very long; consider breaking them up for readability.

### **Suggestions for Revision**

1. **Clarify Transitions:**
   - Add a brief “roadmap” sentence at the start or end of each major section showing how it fits your overall claim about modernity/memory.

2. **Bolster Textual Analysis:**
   - Choose at least one key passage in Antin and one in Roth for close, line-by-line reading—demonstrate “how” the language constructs meaning, not just “what happens.”

3. **Stake Your Claim:**
   - In introduction and conclusion, crystalize your thesis: Is the harbor motif a site of anxiety? Nostalgia? Loss? Reinvention? Why does it endure? Make it as specific as possible.

4. **Address Limits/Counterarguments:**
   - Briefly acknowledge the artificiality of focusing on the harbor—are there rival myths or overlooked perspectives? What gets omitted?

5. **Sharpen Final Paragraphs:**
   - Conclude with 2-3 sentences showing the implications of your argument for future study and/or for an understanding of American national identity.

### **Summary**

This is a thoughtful, well-researched, and ambitious graduate-level essay, with a strong sense of literary and historical context and good close reading skills. With some editing for organization, depth in analysis, and a sharper thesis/conclusion, it will be an impressive contribution to the study of Jewish American literature and the role of memory, myth, and performativity at the borders of identity.
