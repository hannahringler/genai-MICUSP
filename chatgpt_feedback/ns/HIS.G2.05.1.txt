Absolutely! Your paper, “Otherness and Englishness in Late Medieval Pilgrimage Guides,” is impressive for its breadth of research, nuanced argumentation, and fluent academic style. Here is a detailed feedback across several crucial criteria:

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Thesis and Argumentation**
- **Clear, Focused Thesis:** The central argument—that English pilgrimage guides both reflect and construct a specifically English national identity through their practical advice and descriptions of encounters with “the Other”—is clear, original, and consistently maintained.
- **Complexity:** You skillfully complicate the binary of “practical” vs. “meditative,” showing how utilitarian details in guidebooks enable lay and imagined experiences of pilgrimage, and thereby shape both communal and personal identity.

### 2. **Use of Evidence and Sources**
- **Depth and Breadth:** You expertly engage with a wide range of both primary (Wey, Torkington, Guylforde, etc.) and secondary sources—often contextualizing the primary texts through modern scholarship and theory.
- **Effective Quotation:** Textual examples are well-chosen and well-integrated. You balance longer quotations—used for vivid effect or close analysis—with succinct references.
- **Comparative Perspective:** Bringing in Margery Kempe to contrast with the less “emotional” guides, and discussing maps and souvenirs, strengthens your argument about imagined pilgrimage.

### 3. **Analysis and Interpretation**
- **Close Reading:** Your attention to detail—such as the significance of food, phrasebooks, bodily “complexion,” and souvenirs—yields rich interpretation.
- **Nuance:** The paper avoids simplistic readings of attitudes to Jews and Muslims, instead offering subtle commentary on the ways authors distinguish between Biblical past and present, or literary trope and lived experience.
- **Integration of Secondary Literature:** You engage actively with previous scholarship rather than passively summarizing it, often extending, nuancing, or challenging earlier conclusions.

### 4. **Structure and Organization**
- **Logical Progression:** The essay is very well organized, moving smoothly from context and overview into close readings of individual texts, and then into broader thematic analysis.
- **Sectioning:** The separate treatment of each account, followed by synthesis in the conclusion, provides clarity while also supporting sustained comparison.

### 5. **Style and Presentation**
- **Academic Tone:** The prose is clear, competent, and mature, with a style appropriate for graduate-level work.
- **Bibliographic Apparatus:** The footnotes, primary sources, and secondary bibliography are thorough and well presented.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Focus and Conciseness**
- **Streamlining:** At times, the paper is so comprehensive it risks overwhelming the reader. There are places where you repeat similar points (e.g., about phrasebooks or national identity) that could be tightened or consolidated.
- **Clarifying Transitions:** Occasionally, the transition between works or between sections is abrupt; signal more explicitly in your topic sentences *why* you’re moving to the next text or point (though your signposting is generally very good).

### 2. **Clarity of Claims**
- **More Explicit Conclusions:** Sometimes, your interpretations are implied rather than directly stated. For example, when discussing imagined pilgrimage, try to spell out a more explicit statement of significance at the end of each relevant section.
- **Framing of “Englishness”:** You could, in the introduction and conclusion, offer a slightly tighter definition or working theory of “national identity” as understood in this context. Is it about shared symbols, bodily practices, language, something else? A little more theoretical precision would enhance the central claim.

### 3. **Balance of Primary and Secondary**
- **Space for Primary Analysis:** In a few places (especially when surveying earlier scholarship), secondary references crowd out your own voice; always bring the focus back to your interpretive insights.
- **Further Analysis of Visual/Material Culture:** Your discussion of the Wey map and souvenirs is enticing—consider whether this could be more fully integrated, even if briefly, throughout the paper (e.g., could imagined pilgrimage *begin* the paper as well as end it?).

### 4. **Formal and Editorial Points**
- **Consistency in Footnotes/References:** There are some minor stylistic inconsistencies in footnote formatting (page numbers, abbreviations, etc.), but these are very minor.
- **Typos/Omissions:** There are very few, but a final proofreading (spellcheck, grammar) before submission will help.

## **Suggestions for Further Development**
- **Theorize Pilgrimage More Broadly:** Draw a little more explicitly on broader recent work on pilgrimage studies, performance, and imagined space (beyond Turner/Tomasch), to frame your intervention in the field.
- **Engage with Counterexamples:** Is there an instance in these guides where “Englishness” seems less relevant, or where another kind of identity/solidarity overtakes it? Briefly exploring a “limit case” can strengthen your overall argument.

## **Overall Assessment**

This is an excellent, thoughtful, and well-researched paper—already suitable for presentation or submission in a seminar context. Your handling of a wide range of primary material is particularly impressive, and your argument about the construction and utility of “Englishness” in pilgrimage guides is both original and well defended.

**Grade (if required):** A / A+

If you want to tailor this further (for publication, a conference paper, or a particular instructor/editor), I’d recommend focusing your introduction and conclusion a bit more tightly, and adding a few transitions for clarity—but as it stands, this is outstanding work.

If you’d like, I can mark up specific paragraphs or sections for clarity, conciseness, or style—just let me know!
