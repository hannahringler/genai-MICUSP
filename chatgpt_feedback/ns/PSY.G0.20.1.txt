**Areas for Improvement & Suggestions:**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - Some sentences are quite long and could be made more concise for readability. For example, “It is simply amazing just how much this tiny wing in a giant hospital does…” could be revised: “I was amazed by how much this small department accomplishes…”
   - Consider breaking up longer paragraphs for easier reading.

2. **Grammar and Word Choice:**
   - There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases. For instance:
     - **“I become very board and unengaged”** should be **“I become very bored and disengaged.”**
     - **“see what it like to work in a hospital”** should be **“see what it is like to work in a hospital.”**

3. **Variety in Sentence Structure:**
   - Mixing shorter sentences with longer ones can help keep reader interest and emphasize key points.
   - Example of run-on: “On the flip side, my primary weakness is that I am usually very tired after a long and stressful week of school. Sometimes, when I have a lot on my plate at a given moment I often feel like it would have been so much easier had I been allowed to avoid my volunteer duties just to catch up on my own personal matters.”
     - Consider splitting: “On the flip side, my primary weakness is fatigue. After a long, stressful week of school, I sometimes wish I could skip my volunteer duties to catch up on personal matters.”

4. **Professional Tone:**
   - Avoid casual phrases such as “so much easier,” “not fun,” or “just hoping that it would tick faster.” Aim for a tone that is still personal, but slightly more formal for academic writing.
   - Consider rephrasing: “It definitely is not fun to stock towels for a couple of hours…” to “Stocking towels for extended periods can be tedious, and I sometimes struggled to find personal satisfaction in these repetitive tasks.”

5. **Reflection on Learning:**
   - Go one step deeper in your reflection. For example, after discussing the tedious tasks, try connecting this to a broader lesson about healthcare—how all roles contribute to patient care.
   - You mention wishing you had the credentials for more rewarding tasks—maybe reflect on how this motivates you to further your training or education.

6. **Transitions and Flow:**
   - At times, transitions between ideas feel abrupt. Use sentences that link paragraphs or ideas (e.g., “Despite these challenges, my interactions with patients remind me of the impact even small gestures can have.”).

**Example Revision of a Paragraph:**

**Original:**
> During the volunteer experience, there were several aspects that I particularly liked about working in the hospital. My favorite part about being a volunteer is that I get to interact with all different kinds of people, ranging from doctors and nurses to patients that are currently in very bad condition. At first, I naturally noticed each patient primarily for his injury rather than himself as a person.

**Revised:**
> Throughout my volunteering, I particularly appreciated the opportunity to interact with such a diverse group of people, from medical professionals to patients facing difficult recoveries. Initially, I found myself focusing on each patient's injury rather than seeing the individual. However, as I spent more time with them, I began to learn about their personalities, histories, and aspirations, which profoundly changed my perspective.
