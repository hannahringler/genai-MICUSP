Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper: "Does 'practice make perfect' apply to theory? A look at feminist theory and practice in the US battered women's movement." I’ll break my feedback into **strengths**, **areas for improvement**, and **suggestions for revision**.

---

## **Strengths**

**1. Topic Relevance and Scope**
- Your exploration of the disconnect and interplay between feminist theory—especially postmodernism—and practical work in the battered women’s movement is timely and important. It is both theoretically rich and grounded in real-world experience.

**2. Personal Engagement**
- Opening with your personal story as a shelter advocate is powerful. It frames the issue nicely, grounds your argument, and illustrates the real stakes of the theoretical debates you analyze.

**3. Theoretical Breadth and Depth**
- You draw on a broad range of sources, showing a sophisticated understanding of feminist theory (radical, liberal, standpoint, postmodern, etc.).
- Theoretical concepts (deconstruction, essentialism, standpoint theory, etc.) are clearly explained and connected to practice.

**4. Balanced Critique**
- You don’t shy away from critiquing both theory (especially postmodernism’s limitations when applied to activism) and practice (notably, the essentialism sometimes present in battered women’s services).

**5. Proposal for Praxis**
- Concluding with a practical suggestion (“talk-back” sessions) is novel and fitting given your overall argument about bridging theory and practice.

## **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Organizational Clarity**
- At points, the narrative becomes dense and conceptually cluttered. The reader can lose track of your main argument when you delve into nuanced discussions of, for example, essentialism or postmodern theory.
- Your headings ("Fragile ties between theory and practice," etc.) help, but consider further sub-headings or signposts, especially in longer sections dealing with dense theory.

**2. Paragraph and Sentence Structure**
- Many paragraphs are long and cover multiple ideas; consider breaking them up for easier reading.
- Similarly, some sentences are complex and could be simplified for clarity.

**3. Integration of Evidence and Examples**
- You discuss important theoretical tools (e.g., strategic essentialism), but more real-life examples from everyday shelter work, or from your own experience, would help illustrate how these concepts ‘play out’ on the ground.

**4. Reference to Counterarguments**
- You acknowledge exceptions (e.g., feminist scholars still theorizing about violence), but your paper’s forcefulness would increase if you directly addressed, and countered, more critiques of your position.

**5. Concluding Section**
- Your conclusion makes a nice practical proposal. However, reiterating your main theoretical findings and stating their broader implications before introducing the proposal would strengthen the ending.

## **Suggestions for Revision**

**1. Tighten the Introduction**
- In addition to your excellent opening anecdote, make your paper’s thesis and roadmap more explicit. State clearly: What is the core question? What will you argue? How will you organize the discussion?

**2. Guide the Reader**
- Use clearer topic sentences and transition phrases to help the reader follow your line of argument—especially when shifting between theory and practice or among types of feminist theories.

**3. Streamline Theory Sections**
- Summarize theoretical positions (especially postmodernism) more succinctly, focusing on what is most relevant for battered women’s movement practice.

**4. Expand on Practice**
- Deepen your discussion of how shelters and the battered women’s movement have evolved (e.g., with respect to race, sexuality, or male victims). More current data or program examples would ground your critique.

**5. Explicitly Address Praxis**
- Since praxis is a central concern, define and discuss it earlier. Throughout, more actively reflect on moments of productive tension or dialogue between theory and practice.

**6. Revise Conclusion**
- After your proposal for “talk-back” sessions, briefly speculate on what broader changes in the battered women’s movement or feminist theory might look like if your suggestions were adopted.

**7. Mechanical/Editing Issues**
- There are a few minor typos and places where citations or footnotes could be more gracefully integrated into the text. Give your paper another close read for flow and style.

## **Summary Statement**

**Overall, this is a sophisticated, insightful, and personally-engaged paper that tackles a real and enduring problem in feminist studies: the gap between academic theory and activist practice. With further tightening and additional concrete examples, it will be even more compelling and readable.**
