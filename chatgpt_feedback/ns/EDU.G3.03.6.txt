Certainly! Your essay, "Curriculum Changes in the Progressive Era and Great Depression," provides a well-organized and informative overview of how educational curricula evolved in the United States from the late 19th century into the post-World War II period. Below is detailed feedback by category:

**Strengths:**

1. **Historical Context and Clarity:**  
   - You effectively trace the evolution of curriculum from the NEA’s Committee of Ten, through the Progressive Movement, the impact of the Great Depression, Life Adjustment programs, and up to standards-based reforms. There’s a clear chronological flow and context for each period.
   - Key turning points (e.g., Dewey’s influence, the Great Depression’s effect, Sputnik and the NDEA, No Child Left Behind) are well-identified.

2. **Integration of Sources:**  
   - You cite credible sources and provide footnotes for your claims, giving your analysis scholarly weight.
   - The use of both primary figures (Dewey, Eliot) and historians (Kliebard, Tyack, Mirel) demonstrates strong research.

3. **Critical Engagement:**  
   - You discuss not just what changed, but why (e.g., shifts in social need, labor market, ideological battles).
   - The discussion of critics like Bestor and incorporating legislative acts (e.g., NDEA, No Child Left Behind) shows analytical depth.

4. **Balance of Summary and Analysis:**  
   - Most sections do a good job of explaining what was happening and evaluating the impact.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Thesis/Argument:**
   - While the essay is informative and well-structured, it would benefit from a stronger thesis statement in the opening paragraph that clearly lays out your argument or perspective—beyond summarizing what changed, what is your interpretation of the significance or consequences of these changes?
   - Consider answering: To what extent did each reform period succeed or fail in its stated goals? What is your own perspective on the overall impact?

2. **Transitions and Connections:**
   - Some transitions between time periods and reforms could be smoother. For example, the jump from Progressive ideals to post-war Life Adjustment feels a bit abrupt. Introduce each shift with a sentence that links the changes more explicitly (“Building on the progressive movement’s focus on practical life skills, later reforms such as Life Adjustment…”).
   - The end of the third page to the fourth (from Bestor's critique to Sputnik/NDEA) could use a more explicit transition sentence linking criticism to the renewed focus on academics.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Your final paragraph touches on standards-based reforms and briefly reflects on their implications. However, a stronger conclusion would synthesize the key historical currents discussed and explicitly state what these changes have meant for American education (Did earlier reforms ultimately shape current policies? Are we still grappling with the same debates?).
   - End with a statement that ties together your overall analysis, possibly offering a forecast for what lessons history offers for future curriculum decisions.

4. **Depth of Recent Developments:**
   - The section on No Child Left Behind and standards-based reforms is brief given its importance. Either expand this section or, if space is an issue, refocus it on how these relate to the historical trends you’ve discussed.

5. **Style/Clarity:**
   - A few sentences are run-on or could use rephrasing for clarity. For example: "Most of the students who in earlier times would have left school to join the work force ended up shunted into the general track, where classes were watered down in order to keep these children in school.” Try: “Many students who would previously have left school for work were now placed in the general track, where the curriculum was often diluted to accommodate their retention.”
   - When citing multiple ideas from the same source, make sure to vary sentence structure to avoid monotony.

**Minor Notes:**

- Always double-check that footnotes line up with references in your text.
- Consider providing a works cited or bibliography at the end (unless this is not required for your assignment).

**Overall:**  
You demonstrate an excellent command of relevant historical developments and scholarly perspectives. With a few organizational and stylistic tweaks—particularly a clear thesis up front and a more integrated conclusion—your essay will not only inform but also persuade and engage your reader at a higher level.
