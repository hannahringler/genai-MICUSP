Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on your paper, **“Ethics in International Development”**:

---

## **Strengths**

### 1. **Engaging Introduction**
- The paper opens with a topical hook, referencing well-known figures like Bono and Angelina Jolie, which effectively draws the reader in and situates the topic in a contemporary context.
- You immediately pose critical questions about the effectiveness and ethics of aid, signaling a thoughtful, analytical approach.

### 2. **Thorough Engagement with Key Authors**
- You compare and contrast the views of Jeffrey Sachs and William Easterly, two foundational thinkers in the international development debate.
- The nuanced understanding—that one can support both Sachs’ fundraising and Easterly’s caution about effectiveness—is well-argued.

### 3. **Use of Examples and Case Studies**
- Real-world examples (China, India, Malawi, malaria bed nets, HIV/AIDS) strengthen your arguments and ground theoretical points in concrete evidence.
- The Malawi fertilizer subsidy example is particularly compelling and recent.

### 4. **Critical Analysis**
- You don’t take claims at face value, but instead consider incentives, unintended consequences (the “resource curse”), and the possibility that well-intentioned aid can do harm.
- The “thought experiment” about how the West would have developed under foreign “help” is creative and thought-provoking.

### 5. **Logical Structure**
- The paper flows logically from the framing of the debate, to case study evidence, through to recommendations about project scale and priorities (agriculture, health, feedback from recipients).
- You regularly return to core ethical questions, maintaining thematic coherence.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. **Thesis Statement**
- While your argument is clear, an explicit thesis statement in the introduction would help guide the reader. Something like: *“This paper argues that while foreign aid is crucial for overcoming poverty traps, its allocation and implementation must prioritize local input, accountability, and sectoral focus, lest it repeat the failures of the past.”*

### 2. **Depth of Counterarguments**
- You mention Sachs’ “Big Push” and outline compelling critiques, but could devote a few more sentences to why some still support his view, even given the risks.
- Similarly, when critiquing Easterly (e.g., over AIDS medicines), consider detailing his utilitarian concerns more thoroughly before responding to them.

### 3. **Clarity in Recommendations**
- Your conclusion that “health and agriculture should be prioritized” is sound, but could be sharpened. Are there specific criteria or mechanisms for choosing projects? What should donors do differently starting tomorrow? A brief “policy implications” paragraph would be powerful.

### 4. **Writing Style**
- The writing is clear overall, but a few sentences are long or over-complicated. E.g., “Maybe this is because planners have never had to make a decision of this magnitude that affected their very survival...” could be shortened for emphasis.
- Breaking up paragraphs that are a bit dense, especially those that sprawl across topics, can help readability.

### 5. **Use of Sources**
- You reference Sachs, Easterly, and a New York Times article, but more specific citations and a works cited/reference list would strengthen your paper academically.
- Consider directly quoting once or twice from key works to anchor your points.

### 6. **Conclusion**
- The paper ends a bit abruptly. Use the last paragraph to restate your main findings and perhaps point to future research/policy directions (“While no solution is perfect, moving toward locally-accountable, need-driven aid is essential for ethical and effective development.”).

## **Summary of Recommendations**

- **Add an explicit thesis** in the first paragraph.
- **Deepen engagement with counterarguments** for balance.
- **Sharpen and clarify recommendations** at the end.
- Edit for **sentence length and paragraph structure** for easier reading.
- **Cite sources more specifically** and format references.
- **Close with a strong conclusion** that sums up your main message.

## **Overall Assessment**

This is a **thoughtful, well-argued, and relevant** paper that demonstrates a solid grasp of key issues in the ethics of international development. Your use of examples and critique of prevailing orthodoxies are especially strong. With a bit more clarity in argument structure and recommendations—and some attention to style—it would be an excellent undergraduate paper.
