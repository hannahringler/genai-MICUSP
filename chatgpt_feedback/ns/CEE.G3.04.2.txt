Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on the paper “International Law and Environmental Policy”—focused on structure, clarity, depth of analysis, evidence use, and overall writing quality.

### **Overall Assessment**

**Strengths:**
- **Depth & Breadth of Analysis:** The paper demonstrates a deep understanding of the Montreal Protocol (MP), industry roles, and the unique case of methyl bromide (MeBr). It skillfully contrasts the phaseout processes for ODS and MeBr, offering insightful analysis rooted in scholarly sources.
- **Use of Evidence:** There is thorough citation of academic and policy sources, strengthening arguments and demonstrating significant research.
- **Structure:** The paper follows a logical progression—beginning with context, delving into industry roles, essential use exemptions, political negotiations, and culminating in broader lessons for international environmental regimes.
- **Critical Thinking:** The student doesn't just recount what happened; they analyze motivations, political maneuvers, and implications for future agreements.

**Areas for Improvement & Suggestions:**

### 1. **Introduction/Thesis**
- **Feedback:** The introduction is brief, assuming reader familiarity with the Montreal Protocol and its mechanisms. The thesis is implied but not clearly articulated.
- **Suggestion:** Include a clear introductory paragraph outlining the central argument: e.g., "This paper compares the regulatory phaseout of ODS and MeBr under the MP, analyzing how industry influence, scientific uncertainty, and public attention shaped outcomes. Lessons for international environmental policy are discussed."
- **Benefit:** This sets reader expectations and provides a roadmap for your analysis.

### 2. **Organization & Flow**
- **Feedback:** The paper is generally well-organized, but at times paragraphs are dense and the logical flow could be more explicit.
- **Suggestion:** Use more section headers (e.g., “Industry Influence,” “Technology Transfer,” “Case Study: Methyl Bromide,” “Lessons Learned”) or signpost transitions between topics.
- **Benefit:** This will help readers track complex arguments and see connections between sections.

### 3. **Analysis vs. Description**
- **Feedback:** Occasionally, the paper shifts to descriptive narration, especially regarding TEAP proceedings or detailed procedural outcomes.
- **Suggestion:** Whenever you describe events or processes, follow with explicit analysis—why do these outcomes matter, and how do they support your thesis?
- **Benefit:** This improves engagement and keeps the paper analytical rather than recounting.

### 4. **Use of Sources**
- **Feedback:** Excellent incorporation of scholarly work, but many facts are referenced parenthetically without integrating the source material analytically.
- **Suggestion:** Engage with your sources more actively (e.g., “As Benedick argues, this industry resistance ultimately…” rather than just “(Benedick 1998)”).
- **Benefit:** Demonstrates scholarly engagement and makes your writing more persuasive.

### 5. **Argument Clarity**
- **Feedback:** The central argument about industry strategies and regulatory outcomes sometimes gets lost amidst detailed recounting.
- **Suggestion:** Return to your main thesis at the end of key sections. E.g., after discussing MeBr, summarize: “Thus, unlike earlier ODS phaseouts, the lack of public pressure and entrenched industry interests delayed and diluted controls on MeBr, underscoring the importance of public engagement and regulatory certainty.”
- **Benefit:** Reinforces your main point and shows command of your argument.

### 6. **Conclusion**
- **Feedback:** The conclusion is present but brief, suggesting only that MeBr controls will likely strengthen over time, drawing general lessons.
- **Suggestion:** Explicitly synthesize your findings, tie back to your thesis, and articulate concrete policy takeaways or implications for future international environmental law.
- **Benefit:** Leaves readers with a clear sense of what your analysis contributes to the field.

### 7. **Writing Style**
- **Feedback:** The writing demonstrates strong command of English and academic discourse. However, sentence structure can be dense and jargon-heavy.
- **Suggestion:** Break up long sentences, define acronyms on first use, and vary sentence length for readability.
- **Benefit:** Increases clarity and accessibility.

### 8. **Formatting & Citations**
- **Feedback:** Citation style is consistent. However, some parenthetical references may benefit from more precise page numbers for direct claims or quotes.
- **Suggestion:** Use page numbers for all direct quotes or closely paraphrased material.

### **Final Comments**

This paper demonstrates graduate-level engagement with the Montreal Protocol’s policy landscape and the complexities of regulating ODS and MeBr. With some organizational tweaks and more assertive thesis and conclusion statements, it would be even stronger and suitable for publication or presentation.
