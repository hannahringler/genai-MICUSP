Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback for your paper, **"On the Names of God and Man"**:

---

### Strengths

**1. Clear Structure and Organization**
- The paper is logically organized, beginning with an introduction to the importance of names in Genesis, moving through God’s naming, Man’s naming, and culminating in the significance of naming for self-knowledge and relationship.
- Paragraph transitions are smooth and signal shifts in focus effectively.

**2. Depth of Analysis**
- You engage deeply with the biblical text, moving beyond surface-level observations to consider the literary structure (the diptych), the interplay between name and nature, and the development of Man’s self-awareness.
- The discussion of the Hebrew words (adam/adamah, ish/ishshah) is insightful, showing both etymological awareness and interpretive nuance.

**3. Use of Quotations**
- Biblical passages are cited effectively to illustrate your points, grounding your argument in textual evidence.
- The use of quotations is balanced—enough to support but not overwhelm your own analysis.

**4. Engagement with Larger Themes**
- You address major theological and anthropological questions, such as how naming relates to understanding, creativity, and relationship with God and others.
- The paper considers the implications of naming for identity and human experience.

**5. Writing Style**
- The prose is clear, articulate, and mature. Sentences are well-constructed and vocabulary is advanced, appropriate for a senior undergraduate student.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Thesis Clarity**
- Your core argument—that naming by God is creative and by Man is classificatory/reflective—is strong, but could be stated more explicitly at the outset. A sharper thesis in your introduction would help guide readers through your analysis.

**2. Addressing Counterarguments or Other Perspectives**
- The paper would be richer if other scholarly interpretations or potential counter-readings were acknowledged, even briefly. For example, how do other traditions interpret the act of naming? Do all interpreters see as clear a distinction between God’s and Man’s naming?

**3. More Specific Examples/Close Reading**
- While you discuss “Man’s naming” largely in the abstract and through citations, the paper might benefit from a closer reading of specific names or from engaging with the significance of later naming events in Genesis (e.g., naming of places or descendants) to strengthen the argument about naming as memorial and story.

**4. Greater Thematic Conclusion**
- The conclusion does a good job summarizing, but you could go further: Why does this matter? What is at stake, theologically, literarily, or anthropologically? How does this pattern of naming inform the rest of the Bible—or even contemporary considerations about language and identity?

**5. Occasional Redundancy**
- Some points (for example, the sequence of naming and self-awareness) could be made more succinctly—there are a few moments where the same idea is restated in slightly different ways. Tightening these could enhance the paper's impact.

### Minor Suggestions

- **Footnotes/References:** You use only a single source. While this is sufficient for literary analysis of the text itself, you might add one or two scholarly sources (commentaries, theological works) to support your readings.
- **Citation Style:** Ensure that all quotations are correctly cited, and maintain consistency, particularly if using footnotes.
- **Typos:** Minor corrections only (e.g., “it’s” instead of “its” in one case).

### Overall Assessment

This is a well-written, thoughtful, and deeply engaged paper. It demonstrates sophisticated analysis and an excellent command of both the text of Genesis and its major themes. With some sharpening of the introduction and conclusion, and minor additions of counter-argument and scholarly conversation, it would be exemplary.

**Grade Estimate: A- to A**

**Keep up the great work!**
