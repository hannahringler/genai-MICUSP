Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on your essay “How Much Choice is Too Much?” focused on both strengths and areas for development:

---

**Overall Assessment:**
Your essay is thoughtful, engaging, and clearly written. You address the complexities of educational choice and tracking with nuance, historical context, and reference to relevant scholarship. The structure is logical, and your argumentative voice is consistent and convincing. You also skillfully acknowledge counterarguments and provide clear definitions for your discussion.

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Clarity and Engagement**
- The introduction is lively and draws the reader in by imagining a stereotypical debate, which helps contextualize the discussion.
- You define “choice” as it applies to education, and explicitly set boundaries for your argument.
- Your prose is clear and mostly free of jargon, making the essay accessible.

### 2. **Critical Engagement with Sources**
- You reference foundational works (Oakes, Rist, Rosenbaum) to give historical and social context to tracking and curricular choice.
- You use evidence to support your claims, particularly about the unintended consequences of tracking and detracking.

### 3. **Balanced Argument**
- The essay avoids a simplistic “pro” or “con” stance, acknowledging the complexity of the issue.
- Counterarguments are anticipated (for example, what a “choice” advocate might say), and are addressed thoughtfully.

### 4. **Thoughtful Recommendations**
- Instead of just critiquing, you offer solutions, advocating for better advising and middle-ground reforms.
- Conclusion ties the discussion back to broader values and the societal role of education.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. **Thesis Statement and “Roadmap”**
- Your overall position—favoring a balanced approach—is clear, but the thesis could be made more direct and explicit in the introduction. A brief roadmap of how you’ll develop your argument would also help guide the reader.

**Suggestion:** End your introduction with a concise thesis (“I will argue that...”) and briefly outline your main points.

---

### 2. **Development of Core Concepts**
- You refer to “tracks” and “tracking,” but a bit more explanation for readers unfamiliar with these systems would help. This could be just a few sentences about how tracking often works in practice.
- The notion of “success” could be explained further—economic integration is mentioned, but what constitutes “success” in a holistic educational sense?

---

### 3. **Evidence and Examples**
- The use of sources is strong, but consider including a short, real-world example or data point about where these policies have worked or failed specifically in named districts/systems.
- Some points are asserted (e.g., “more advising is preferable to more sports funding”)—a brief citation or more detailed argument here would strengthen your case.

---

### 4. **Organization and Transitions**
- The essay flows well overall, but some transitions between paragraphs feel a bit abrupt, particularly when shifting from tracking to choice systems.
- A brief concluding paragraph, rather than a closing sentence, would allow you to revisit your thesis and synthesize your recommendations.

---

### 5. **Tone and Formality**
- The essay’s conversational tone is engaging but sometimes borders on informal (“she’d bellow,” “cry foul,” etc.). Consider your audience: if this is a formal academic essay, a slightly more formal tone may be more appropriate.
- The use of hypothetical dialogue is clever, but shouldn’t overshadow or undercut your more analytical points.

---

### 6. **Addressing Broader Impacts**
- You do mention the value of the high school diploma, but might expand on the societal consequences of either too much or too little choice (e.g., labor market outcomes, civic engagement, or social equity).

---

### 7. **Minor Points**
- Some sentences are quite long or complex; consider breaking them up for easier reading.
- Double-check for minor typographical errors (“are not responsible adults yet” should be “are not responsible adults yet”—probably just missing an article).
- Endnotes are appreciated, and the bibliography is clear.

---

## **Summary**
You’ve written a nuanced and well-argued essay that critically engages with both sides of the curricular choice debate. With a more direct thesis, slightly more formal tone, smoother transitions, and perhaps some additional examples, your argument would be even stronger. Overall, you demonstrate thoughtful analysis and solid command of the academic literature.

If you have a specific aspect you want more feedback on—content, organization, writing style, etc.—let me know!
