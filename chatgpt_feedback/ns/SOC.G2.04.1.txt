### Overall Impressions

This is a high-quality graduate-level literature review and research proposal. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the field, is well-organized, and presents a clear rationale for a new study in an area with significant social impact. The writing is clear, the literature review is comprehensive, and the proposed methodology is appropriate and thoughtfully justified.

### Strengths

#### 1. **Comprehensive Literature Review**
- The paper provides an extensive overview of both the historical progression of the battered women’s movement and the legal/criminalization aspects of domestic violence.
- It thoughtfully covers both seminal and recent studies, reflecting a nuanced understanding of evolving research paradigms.
- The discussion includes key literature, relevant federal policy changes, and critiques of criminal justice-focused approaches.

#### 2. **Theoretical and Societal Framing**
- Contextualizes domestic violence prosecution within broader feminist and social justice movements.
- Addresses both intended and unintended consequences of criminalizing domestic violence, incorporating multiple stakeholder perspectives.

#### 3. **Identification of Literature Gaps**
- Clearly highlights the lack of research on family-level impacts, victim perspectives, relationship quality, and effects on children.
- Points out disconnects between family sociology and criminalization research.

#### 4. **Clear Research Proposal**
- Presents a clear and feasible research question: "*What are the effects of domestic violence prosecution on families?*"
- The rationale for qualitative methodology is well-supported and the ethics of research with a vulnerable population are addressed.

#### 5. **Thoughtful Interview Protocol**
- The proposed semi-structured interview guide is sensitive and comprehensive.
- Issues of confidentiality, consent, and safety are adequately considered.

#### 6. **Well-Cited**
- Extensive bibliography and engagement with primary and secondary sources.

### Areas for Improvement and Suggestions

#### 1. **Balance Between Breadth and Depth**
- **Feedback:** The review is extensive, but at times breadth comes at the expense of depth. Some key debates (e.g., about efficacy of prosecution strategies or victim autonomy vs. mandatory prosecution) could be explored in more depth, with more critical analysis.
- **Suggestion:** For your final version, consider delving deeper into 2-3 of the most contested or important scholarly debates.

#### 2. **Critical Engagement**
- **Feedback:** While the paper acknowledges literature gaps, it is largely descriptive.
- **Suggestion:** Provide more critical engagement with the literature. For example, explicitly compare and contrast studies with conflicting results, or critically analyze the implications of different methodological choices in the studies you review.

#### 3. **Framing of Research Contribution**
- **Feedback:** The proposal could more clearly articulate the unique contribution your study intends to make.
- **Suggestion:** Include a few lines about how findings could inform policy/practice, particularly regarding prosecutorial practices, victim advocacy, or coordinated community responses.

#### 4. **Methodological Considerations**
- **Feedback:** The qualitative, semi-structured interview approach is a good fit, but methodological limitations could be more explicitly addressed. For example, selection bias (since participants are recruited from a shelter) or the limitations associated with self-report data.
- **Suggestion:** Explicitly acknowledge possible limitations and how you plan to address or mitigate them (e.g., triangulating with agency data, member checking).

#### 5. **Language and Tone**
- **Feedback:** The writing is strong but can be a bit formal or passive in places.
- **Suggestion:** Use more active voice and “signposting” in transitions to maintain reader engagement. For example, phrases like "This section argues..." or "I will now show that..." also help the reader.

#### 6. **Utility of Findings**
- **Feedback:** The potential practical value of the research findings could be highlighted more.
- **Suggestion:** Devote a short paragraph in the conclusion outlining possible implications for policy, practice, or further research.

#### 7. **Minor Issues**
- Proofreading for repetition (some points about research gaps are repeated).
- Consider discussing challenges (e.g., researcher safety, distress of participants) in your proposed methodology.

### Example Improvements (Edits in Practice)

> “I will conduct approximately 30 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with female survivors...”

**Suggestion:**  
“To explore the lived experiences of women affected by domestic violence prosecution, I will conduct approximately 30 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with female survivors whose intimate partners have been recently arrested...”

### Summary

**This is an excellent and well-crafted proposal.** By incorporating more critical engagement, clarifying the unique contribution of your study, and more explicitly addressing anticipated challenges and limitations, you can further strengthen your paper. The research question is timely, and your approach demonstrates both scholarly rigor and ethical sensitivity.
