Absolutely! Here’s a structured feedback on your paper, focusing on **strengths**, **areas for improvement**, and some **specific suggestions**.

---

## Strengths

1. **Clear Structure and Scope**:  
   - The paper has a logical flow, starting from background and definitions, moving into specifics of the control problem, then discussing algorithm choices and summarizing recommendations.
   - You clearly state the scope: proposing control algorithms for specific pointing applications on a CubeSat-class satellite.

2. **Technical Depth**:  
   - The discussion demonstrates a solid understanding of satellite attitude control, distinguishing between different kinds of pointing (nadir, inertial).
   - Concepts like B-dot control and linear quadratic regulators are well-introduced and tied to their practical use in the field.

3. **Relevance and Justification**:
   - You justify the choice of actuators (magnetic torque coils) based on CubeSat constraints (weight, power).
   - The reasons for choosing particular algorithms (B-dot for detumbling, constant gain/integral action for nadir pointing) are outlined clearly and with reference to literature and real missions.

4. **Literature Awareness**:  
   - The reference to flown missions (e.g., NCUBE, AAU cubesat) grounds your recommendations in practical, tested examples.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Clarity and Readability**:  
   - Some sentences are long and complex, which can make understanding difficult for readers not deeply familiar with the topic.
   - Occasional typographical or grammatical mistakes (e.g., “trade of” instead of “trade-off,” “in with the simultaneous introduction…”).

2. **Figures**:  
   - Reference to figures (e.g., figure-1a, figure-3) is made, but the content and usefulness of the figures are not explained in the text. Make sure the figures are referenced meaningfully; describe briefly what they illustrate and why they’re important.

3. **Comparison Table/Tables**:  
   - Table-1 is mentioned in the text, but there is no actual table shown. If a table is referenced, it should be included.

4. **Details on Controller Design**:  
   - When discussing controllers (especially constant gain + integral action), it would be beneficial to add a bit more explanation about what the “integral action” accomplishes and why it’s important for stability about the reference.

5. **Recommendations Section**:  
   - The recommendations could be strengthened by being more specific about simulation parameters or performance metrics. 
   - There’s a small typo: "the evaluate" should be "then evaluate".

6. **Referencing**:  
   - While you mention other satellites and literature, explicit citations or a references section would help readers track down your sources.

## Specific Suggestions

- **Abstract/Summary**:  
  Consider adding an abstract at the start to summarize your intent and findings for quick review.

- **Language Edits**:  
  - Re-read the text for minor errors and sentence clarity.
  - For example, instead of:  
    “This selection is made as a trade of between weight, power consumption and available power.”  
    Try:  
    “This selection represents a trade-off between weight, power consumption, and the available onboard power.”
  - “It was also found that the system has a large range of stable gains which give some leeway for incorrect moment of inertia determination and decreases in available power.”
    might flow better as:  
    “Additionally, the system exhibits a large range of stable gains, which allows tolerance to errors in moment of inertia estimation and fluctuations in available power.”

- **Expand on Results**:  
  - Where possible, include table(s) or figures comparing the performance of the algorithms you mention, either from simulations or literature.

- **Future Work**:  
  - Consider adding a one-line “future work” section or comment (e.g., “Future work could involve hardware-in-the-loop testing or flight validation of the chosen algorithm”).
