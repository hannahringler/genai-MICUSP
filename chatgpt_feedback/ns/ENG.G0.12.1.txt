Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback review of your paper, **“Women in Beowulf”**:

---

## Strengths

1. **Clear Thesis and Purpose**
   - Your central argument—women in *Beowulf* wield significant, albeit differently manifested, power—is clear and consistent throughout the essay. The comparison between Wealhtheow and Grendel’s mother is insightful and establishes a nuanced approach to female agency.

2. **Textual Evidence and Analysis**
   - You make effective use of direct textual quotes from *Beowulf*. This grounds your interpretation solidly in the text. The analysis of Wealhtheow’s speeches and actions, as well as Grendel's mother’s motivations, showcase a close reading.
   - Your close reading of passages (e.g., the cup-bearing scene, Wealhtheow's warnings about Hrothulf, the battle scenes with Grendel’s mother) provides strong support for your claims.

3. **Contextual Awareness**
   - The introduction’s acknowledgement of modern notions of gender equality versus historical context is a thoughtful framing device. It shows an awareness of both the original cultural setting of *Beowulf* and the contemporary reader’s assumptions.

4. **Organization**
   - The essay is clearly organized into sections: the role and power of Wealhtheow, the actions of Grendel’s mother, and how both affect the story’s outcomes. The flow is logical and easy to follow.

5. **Connection Between Female Characters**
   - Comparing the influence and motives of Wealhtheow and Grendel’s mother offers a comprehensive view of women’s roles, highlighting both political/social and physical/maternal power.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Thesis Clarity and Complexity**
   - While your thesis is clear, you could make it more nuanced by explicitly stating in the introduction that women’s power takes forms both visible (public speeches, acts of vengeance) and invisible (influence, preservation of kin). This would guide the reader through your argument more directly.

2. **Engagement with Scholarship**
   - The essay relies almost exclusively on your own analysis. Engaging with at least one or two external critics (even briefly) could strengthen your argument by showing you understand the critical conversation surrounding this topic.

3. **More Nuance in Grendel’s Mother Analysis**
   - Your analysis of Grendel’s mother is strong, but sometimes leans toward simply reversing traditional gender roles (i.e., showing she is just as strong or motivated as a man). Consider discussing the unique implications of her being a “monster” and a mother—how does her otherness complicate her power, or the text’s view on women’s agency?

4. **Addressing Counterarguments or Limitations**
   - It would strengthen your argument to briefly acknowledge and address potential counterpoints—such as the fact that both women’s actions are still circumscribed by the patriarchal structures in the poem, or that their power is ultimately limited (Grendel’s mother, for instance, is killed by Beowulf).

5. **Conclusion**
   - The conclusion could be expanded. Consider reflecting on broader implications: What does *Beowulf*’s portrayal of women suggest about the society that produced the poem? How might this analysis reshape modern readers’ views? This would leave a stronger impression on your audience.

6. **Minor Stylistic Suggestions**
   - A few sentences are quite long or complex. Breaking them up could enhance readability. For example: “She contributes more to the likelihood of a positive outcome for her people than the king or any other male does, by bestowing these vitally important gifts on Beowulf.” could be split for clarity.

## Overall Assessment

This is a **thoughtful, well-argued, and textually grounded essay**. You go beyond surface-level interpretations to reveal the complexities of women’s power in *Beowulf*. With some added engagement with scholarship, more nuanced exploration of Grendel’s mother’s monstrosity, and a slightly stronger conclusion, this paper would stand out at the undergraduate level.

**Final suggestion:** Try to leave your reader not just convinced of your thesis, but also thinking about what it means for how we read literature from patriarchal societies today.
