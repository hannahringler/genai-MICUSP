Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, **"The Changing Face of Marxist Historical Analysis"**:

---

### Strengths

**1. Clear Structure and Purpose**
- The introduction clearly lays out your paper's aim: to compare Marx’s historical materialism with Thompson’s approach and situate these within broader historiographical shifts using Novick’s work.
- The organization moves logically from defining terms and setting up Marx’s framework, to analysis of Thompson, to discussion of historiographical context.

**2. Evidence and Use of Sources**
- You effectively support your claims with well-chosen quotes from Marx, Thompson, and Novick, giving your argument scholarly grounding.
- Citation is appropriately thorough, showing careful reading and integration of major texts.

**3. Depth of Comparative Analysis**
- The subtle differences between Marx’s determinism and Thompson’s more nuanced approach to ideology and consciousness are well-explained.
- You go beyond summary—your analysis shows you understand why these historians differed, linking their approaches to broader disciplinary shifts.

**4. Engagement with Historiography**
- The inclusion of Novick’s work is excellent, moving your paper beyond simple textual comparison toward considerations of how changing views in the discipline (objectivity, empiricism, relativism) shaped historians’ methods.

**5. Strong Conclusion**
- You end by reaffirming Thompson’s place in the Marxist tradition, providing a thoughtful synthesis of your findings.

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Thesis Statement**
- Your thesis is present, but it could be a touch sharper. Consider foregrounding *how* these differences in Marxist analysis (e.g., Thompson’s "move away" from historical materialism, use of consciousness, etc.) impact the interpretation of history.

  **Suggestion:** Make your introductory claim about Thompson’s divergence from Marx more specific: Is this a methodological difference, a change in political stakes, or related to broader shifts in historical objectivity?

**2. Balancing Summary and Critical Analysis**
- In some sections (especially when recapping Marx’s position), your writing tends toward summary. While clear, you could be a bit more analytical—e.g., critically evaluate the implications of Marx’s determinism, or problematize whether Thompson is “less” Marxist, or simply differently Marxist.

**3. Flow and Transitions**
- At times, your paper jumps from one thinker/idea to another somewhat abruptly (e.g., from Thompson to Novick). Use transition sentences to clarify why you are moving to a new source and how it connects to your main argument.

**4. Room for More Concrete Examples**
- You cite Thompson’s approach to "food riots," etc., but a more detailed mini-example from his text could show, rather than tell, how he integrates ideology and consciousness in his method.

**5. Addressing Possible Counterpoints**
- A very minor critique: You could briefly acknowledge that not all would agree Thompson’s Marxism diminishes materialism—some would argue he expands its horizons or adapts to new evidence.

**6. Style and Proofreading**
- There are a handful of typos and awkward phrasings (“jut” instead of “just”; “starting principal” should be “starting principle”). Be sure to proofread.
- Watch out for wordiness (e.g., "the changing face of Marxist historical analysis"—consider if this is the best/most precise way to frame your argument).

### Overall Comments

This is a **strong, thoughtful, and well-researched paper**. You show a clear understanding of the intellectual context and significance of the historians discussed. With sharper transitions, a stronger analytical edge, and a slightly more explicit thesis, this would be excellent at the graduate level.

If you have a word or page limit, you’re using your space wisely. If you’re allowed more space, try to do a closer reading of a passage or two from Thompson to exemplify your argument in more detail.

**Great job!**
