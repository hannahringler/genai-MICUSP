Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your essay, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement, including structure, argumentation, use of sources, and writing style.

**Overall Feedback**

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Thesis and Purpose:**  
   - Your stance—that college-level writing courses should be mandatory—is clearly articulated. From the introduction, it’s clear what you’re arguing and why.

2. **Engagement with Source Material:**  
   - You engage deeply with Mike Rose’s article, not just summarizing its claims but responding thoughtfully with your own interpretations and critiques. Your use of direct quotes and page citations adds credibility.

3. **Logical Progression of Ideas:**  
   - The essay progresses logically, moving from a general defense of writing instruction, questioning definitions, and then critiquing the attitudes in higher education about writing’s role.

4. **Personal Experience:**  
   - Including your own experiences (and your children’s) bolsters your argument and adds a relatable, authentic voice.

5. **Addressing Counterarguments:**  
   - You acknowledge opposing views (e.g., the “academy’s” stance on writing as a “technical skill” and the blame placed on secondary education) and refute them.

6. **Concluding Call to Action:**  
   - The conclusion circles back to the thesis and ends with a clear call for responsibility and change.

**Areas for Improvement & Suggestions:**

1. **Organization and Paragraph Cohesion:**
   - While the flow is logical, some paragraphs are dense with multiple claims. Consider breaking up large, idea-dense paragraphs into smaller ones, each focused on a single point.
   - Occasionally, transitions between points (especially between arguments based on Rose and your personal anecdotes) could be clearer. Use topic sentences to guide the reader.

2. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - Some sentences are wordy or have convoluted structures, which make your meaning harder to follow. For example:  
     > “But, there is a problem with their definition—it is incomplete.”  
     You could sharpen this: (“However, their definition is incomplete.”)
   - Likewise, review for passive constructions that could be more direct.

3. **Evidence and Examples:**
   - While you quote Rose and cite the dictionary, it could strengthen your argument to briefly mention research or data on the effectiveness of mandatory writing courses, or reference university policies as examples.

4. **Balance Between Summary and Analysis:**  
   - At points, you spend a lot of time explaining Rose’s position. Aim to spend more words on your own analysis or reflection, using summary only as needed to frame your argument.

5. **Style and Tone:**
   - Your voice is engaging and authentic. However, expressions like “I submit to the academy's complaint...” could be more simply stated (“I acknowledge, however, that...”).  
   - Avoid rhetorical questions that may seem defensive (e.g., “does this fact make me one of those who are '[among] the truly illiterate?'”). It’s more powerful to assertively rebut the point.

6. **Mechanics and Proofreading:**
   - There are minor grammatical and punctuation issues (“if it every really is”—should be “ever really is”; some missing commas).
   - Check for superfluous quotation marks and misplaced commas.

7. **Citation Style:**
   - Your citations are thorough, but ensure the Works Cited is formatted consistently according to MLA/APA/Chicago style as required by your course.
