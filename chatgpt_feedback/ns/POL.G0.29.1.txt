Absolutely! Below is a detailed feedback on your paper “Seeking Hope at Home” based on content, argumentation, structure, sources, and style. I will include strengths as well as specific suggestions for improvement.

### Overall Strengths

1. **Depth of Historical Context:**  
   You provide a comprehensive historical background, carefully explaining the evolution of housing discrimination from the early 20th century through the civil rights era and beyond.

2. **Connection to Legal Precedent:**  
   The detailed explanations of pivotal Supreme Court cases (Buchanan v. Warley, Corrigan v. Buckley, Shelley v. Kraemer, etc.) show a strong grasp of how law and social realities interact.

3. **Clear Use of Sources:**  
   The variety and scholarly nature of your sources (law reviews, historical monographs, journal articles) gives credibility to the paper.

4. **Recognition of Complexity:**  
   You do well to note that victories (like Shelley v. Kraemer) were limited and created opportunities for new discriminatory tactics. You avoid simplistic narratives of “problem fixed,” which reflects critical thinking.

5. **Synthesis and Reflection:**  
   Your concluding sections discussing the legacy of the movement and lessons for organizing today show reflection and offer thoughtful insight.

## Areas for Improvement & Suggestions

#### 1. **Thesis & Framing**
- **Current thesis:** Your thesis emerges clearly, especially by the end, but could be stated more explicitly near the beginning. Give the reader a roadmap: what precisely will you demonstrate about legal change, social movements, and the persistence of housing discrimination?
    - *Suggestion:* Start with a clear, focused thesis statement outlining your main argument in the first page.

#### 2. **Organization & Flow**
- The paper is mostly chronologically structured, which works, but at times the section transitions feel abrupt—especially when moving between decades or types of discrimination.
    - *Suggestion:* Use clearer topic sentences and transition paragraphs to frame each era’s significance and connect to your broader argument.

#### 3. **Depth versus Breadth**
- You provide a thorough survey, but sometimes interesting concepts (like redlining, or the confusion over "state action") are only explained briefly, making arguments feel a bit surface-level.
    - *Suggestion:* Consider focusing more deeply on fewer examples, using them to illustrate key points in more detail.

#### 4. **Analysis versus Summary**
- Some paragraphs summarize events, cases, or arguments from your sources with minimal original analysis (for example, recounting case decisions). More often, you explain their significance, but sometimes the narrative slips into summary.
    - *Suggestion:* Regularly pause after summaries to analyze why this detail is important for your argument. What does each legal case reveal about the limits of law or the strategies of resistance?

#### 5. **Voice and Argumentation**
- At times, your voice and judgment emerge strongly (“It is unfortunate race still plays such a prominent role…”) while at other times the paper becomes more distanced and neutral.
    - *Suggestion:* Decide if this paper is making a clear normative claim, and if so, consistently frame your analysis with your perspective. If it’s more descriptive, rein in subjective asides.

#### 6. **Recent Developments**
- You emphasize events through the 1990s–2000s (with mentions of predatory lending), but could connect more to very recent developments (thought not strictly necessary for a historical analysis).
    - *Suggestion (optional):* A brief mention of either the housing crash (2008), gentrification, or current fair housing activity could make the paper feel particularly timely.

#### 7. **Conclusion**
- Your conclusion is thoughtful but could be sharper. Sometimes it covers similar ground as earlier sections; there is opportunity to drive home the central insight(s) about the relationship between legal action and grassroots advocacy, and what this suggests for future reform.
    - *Suggestion:* Summarize your main lessons in a concise, impactful final paragraph.

### Minor Style/Editing Notes

- Watch for a few typos and unclear antecedents (“the justice’s intent”), and avoid repetition (phrases like “remained confined” appear multiple times).
- Citations are consistently present, but make sure they align with your required citation style.

## Sample Revision: Introduction

**Current:**  
“Extensive research has documented how neighborhood conditions affect life outcomes… their efforts have been complicated at times by whites, who have used a variety of tactics to prevent blacks from settling in…”

**Suggested Revision:**  
“Where one lives in the United States has long determined a host of life outcomes, from economic opportunity to educational access. Throughout the twentieth century, racially discriminatory housing policies and practices systematically restricted African-Americans’ access to adequate homes and neighborhoods. While landmark Supreme Court cases—especially Shelley v. Kraemer—struck down some of these explicit forms of exclusion, this paper argues that legal victories alone were insufficient. Lasting change required, and continues to require, persistent grassroots activism and government oversight, as new methods of discrimination consistently arose to replace those declared unlawful.”
