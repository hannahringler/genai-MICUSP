Absolutely! Here’s a detailed evaluation of your paper, **"America’s Undercover Racism"**:

---

## **Strengths**

### **1. Clear Thesis and Purpose**
You have a strong, clearly articulated central idea: that America’s history of legal and informal racial discrimination has created lasting inequality, and that both institutional and subtle forms of racism continue today. The title is apt and compelling.

### **2. Use of Evidence**
You thoughtfully employ statistics, studies, and historical references (e.g., Civil Rights Act, GI Bill, the crack vs. powder cocaine sentencing disparity) to support your claims. Citing sources such as Wilkins, Morin, the Council of Economic Advisers, and studies by Bertrand and Turner adds credibility.

### **3. Acknowledgement of Progress**
You wisely note the progress made, but stress that it’s insufficient. This balanced approach strengthens your argument and shows critical thinking.

### **4. Personal Reflection**
Including your own experiences and motivations in the penultimate paragraph adds a meaningful, human element. It shows engagement with the topic beyond academics.

### **5. Organization**
Your structure is logical. You move from historical context to institutional analysis, then to personal reflection and a call to personal action.

## **Areas for Improvement**

### **1. Depth of Analysis**
- While you touch on multiple areas (economics, housing, incarceration, etc.), some sections could benefit from more depth. For example, the labor market and housing sections could further unpack the social and emotional consequences for minorities beyond statistics.

### **2. Engagement with Counterarguments**
- To strengthen your paper, briefly address and rebut common arguments against the existence or persistence of systemic racism (e.g., the idea of a "colorblind" society, or claims that affirmative action is "reverse discrimination").

### **3. Transitions and Clarity**
- At times, transitions between ideas and paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the shift from the GI Bill to current incarceration disparities is a bit abrupt. Consider using transitional sentences to better link ideas.

### **4. Source Integration**
- While you present sources, sometimes the citations feel tacked on rather than integrated. Try synthesizing the information more seamlessly into your narrative. E.g., rather than "As shown in a study…," you might write, "Studies have repeatedly shown that even equally qualified Black job seekers face significant disadvantages, as evidenced by Bertrand’s influential resume experiment…"

### **5. Precision and Tone**
- Aim for academic precision in statements. For example, in the opening paragraph: "It appears that time has skewed the simple fact…" could be clearer. Try "Over time, many Americans have forgotten the extent to which historical injustices shape current disparities…"
- Be careful with the phrase "colorblind setting." Recent scholarship cautions that professing colorblindness can sometimes ignore ongoing inequalities. Consider rephrasing to express your parents’ efforts to raise you without prejudice, while recognizing that true equity requires more than ignoring race.

### **6. Conclusion**
- The paper ends with a personal strategy to confront racism, which is strong. However, you could briefly broaden your conclusion to the societal level: What systemic changes are needed, in addition to individual action?

### **7. Formatting and Style**
- Minor: Repeated "Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Papers…" footer can be omitted in final formatting.
- Tighten some sentences for conciseness and flow.

## **Summary Feedback**

**Overall, this is a thoughtful, well-structured, and well-argued essay that demonstrates both personal engagement and command of the issues.** With some additional depth, smoother transitions, and a bit more engagement with counterarguments and current scholarship, you could elevate your paper to a truly exceptional level. Continue to balance data with human stories, and your call to action (both personal and societal) will resonate even more powerfully.

**Grade Estimate: B+/A-**  
(Depending on the rubric and expectations for the assignment, but you are definitely on the right track.)
