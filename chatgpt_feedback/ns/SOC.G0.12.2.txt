Certainly! Here is a detailed feedback for your SOC 458 research paper. I've evaluated your thesis, evidence, structure, and writing clarity, and included suggestions for improvement.

---

## Strengths

**1. Clear Thesis:**  
Your thesis is clearly stated: that tracking favors upper and middle-class students and perpetuates educational discrimination. You set up the need for an alternative system early on, which gives your paper direction and purpose.

**2. Use of Evidence:**  
You effectively use scholarly sources (Oakes and Noguera) to support your arguments, and you refer to relevant studies and findings to challenge assumptions about tracking. Citing specific research strengthens your paper’s credibility.

**3. Critique of Tracking Assumptions:**  
The way you challenge broad assumptions about homogeneous grouping is nuanced and informed. You note how tracking may primarily serve teachers’ convenience rather than student growth, which is a strong critical insight.

**4. Real-world Examples:**  
The discussion of the St. Louis school system and the information teachers receive about students provides a concrete, real-world illustration of the biases and flaws in early tracking.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Structure and Flow:**  
The structure can be improved by signposting sections more clearly, and using topic sentences to show how each paragraph builds on your thesis. Some paragraphs are long and contain several ideas—breaking them into smaller, focused sections can enhance readability.

**Suggestion:**  
- **Add section headings** (e.g. “The Myth of Homogeneous Grouping,” “Bias in Early Tracking,” “Implications and Solutions”).
- **Begin each paragraph** with a clear topic sentence that indicates its relation to your main argument.

**2. Development of Solutions:**  
Your thesis calls for a new system to support all students, but you do not elaborate much on what this system would look like. Including at least a paragraph on potential reforms, or examples of alternative approaches (e.g., detracking, differentiated instruction, project-based learning), would strengthen your paper.

**3. Counterarguments:**  
While you mention studies supporting homogeneous grouping for the brightest students, your discussion is brief. A stronger paper would address counterarguments in more depth before refuting them. This demonstrates critical engagement.

**4. Use of Quotes:**  
You use several direct quotes, which is good, but make sure each quote is well-integrated and followed by analysis explaining its significance.

**Suggestion:**  
- After quoting, add a sentence or two interpreting the importance of the quote and reinforcing how it supports your point.

**5. Transitions:**  
Some transitions between major points are abrupt. More transitional phrases or summary sentences can help your reader follow your logic.

**6. Conclusion:**  
The provided pages end abruptly without a formal conclusion. Ensure your final draft includes a concluding paragraph summarizing your findings and restating the importance of addressing tracking in education.

**7. Minor Grammar and Clarity:**  
- Proofread for small grammatical issues (e.g. "are not being help back" should be "are not being held back").
- Occasionally, sentences can be tightened for clarity. For example, instead of “I would argue that while this information can sometimes be useful, it is no way an accurate method of labeling a student into a certain track,” you might say, “While this information may sometimes be useful, it is not an accurate or fair basis for assigning students to tracks.”
- Consistent use of terms (e.g., "upper tracks," "higher tracks") helps avoid confusion.

## Overall Assessment

Your paper presents a thoughtful, well-documented critique of tracking in schools, especially regarding how it reinforces class-based educational inequities. With improved structure, deeper engagement with counterarguments and solutions, and a concluding section, your paper will become more convincing and polished.

**Summary of Suggestions:**
- Improve structure and transitions.
- Expand discussion of solutions and alternatives.
- Address counterarguments more fully.
- Integrate and analyze quotes.
- Add a conclusion.
- Proofread for clarity and minor errors.
