Certainly! Here’s some detailed feedback on your paper, covering **strengths**, **areas for improvement**, and **suggestions for revision**:

---

### **Strengths**

1. **Clear Motivation and Relevance**:  
   - Your introduction effectively sets the stage by explaining why shotgun marriages matter for understanding demographic and economic trends in the United States. You connect the topic to larger issues like the feminization of poverty, single motherhood, and policy implications.

2. **Research Context**:  
   - You appropriately reference Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz’s well-known study and position your inquiry in relation to theirs. This shows good awareness of key literature and how your work fits in.

3. **Awareness of Data Limitations**:  
   - You are honest and clear about data constraints, especially in earlier decades. This transparency adds rigor and credibility to your proposal.

4. **Analytical Detail**:  
   - You thoughtfully describe alternative ways to estimate conception dates and discuss their methodological drawbacks. This helps build trust in your research design.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Structure and Signposting**:  
   - The organization of your proposal could be clearer. Consider separating it into sections (e.g., Introduction, Literature Review, Data and Methods, Next Steps). Signposting each section will improve readability.

2. **Clarity and Conciseness**:  
   - Some sentences are long and contain multiple ideas, making them harder to follow. Breaking these up will help. For example, when describing methodology, save technical detail for a specific "Methods" part.

3. **Research Aim and Hypothesis**:  
   - Your aim is implied rather than stated outright. Consider adding a concise research question or hypothesis (e.g., "I hypothesize that X...").

4. **Depth on Alternative Explanations**:  
   - You mention "competing explanations" for the rise in out-of-wedlock births (job availability, welfare incentives), but don’t elaborate. A brief summary would enhance your literature review.

5. **Use of Sources**:  
   - While you discuss data sources, adding references for other key findings (e.g., outcomes of single-parent households, trends in the feminization of poverty) would strengthen your argument.

6. **Technical Accuracy/Medical Context**:  
   - Your discussion of gestation length issues is good, but more explicit medical/statistical context would help (e.g., citing typical gestation ranges and factors affecting reporting accuracy).

### **Suggestions for Revision**

- **Add Section Headings**: Introduce clear headings (e.g., Introduction, Literature Review, Data Sources, Methodological Challenges, Next Steps).

- **Tighten the Abstract/Introduction**: Start with 2-3 sentences summarizing your research question and why it matters.

- **Clarify Your Research Question**: Explicitly state what you are asking or seeking to show.

- **Map Out the Next Steps**: End with a concrete methods plan (what you’ll do in order, what obstacles you foresee, how you’ll address them).

- **Optimize Paragraph Structure**: Each paragraph should have a main idea. Avoid overly long paragraphs, especially in technical discussions.

- **Cite More Broadly**: Wherever you refer to scholarly consensus or statistics, try to support the statement with a citation—even if it’s just a classic review paper.

- **Polish Language**: Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing or long-winded sentences that can be streamlined.

### **Overall Impression**

This is an intellectually ambitious and promising proposal with a strong grounding in the literature, and an honest discussion of the limitations of available data. With clearer structure, a more explicit research question, and a concise methodology section, it will be very compelling!
