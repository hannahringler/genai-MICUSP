Absolutely! This is a thoughtful, engaging, and well-researched undergraduate research proposal. Below, I offer detailed feedback on the structure, arguments, evidence, style, and areas for potential improvement. I hope this is helpful!

## **Overall Impressions**

**Strengths:**
- The introduction is vivid, personal, and immediately hooks the reader (e.g., your Paris “snow day” anecdote).
- The proposal demonstrates a clear, personal motivation for research, and situates the research question within compelling current events (strikes, riots, EU referendum).
- You display strong knowledge of French history, politics, and culture, referencing Tocqueville, the French Revolution, and current sociopolitical events.
- The paper is well-organized: you move coherently from context to problem, to possible solution, to your proposed research methods.
- You engage critically and fairly with concepts like solidarity, problematizing the mythology surrounding it while acknowledging its aspirational power.
- The research methods (use of focus groups, polling, primary/secondary sources) are appropriate, and the reasoning behind each is well articulated.
- The writing is clear, energetic, and confident. Citations are well integrated.

**Areas for Improvement:**

### 1. **Thesis Focus and Research Questions**
- At times, the central research question risks being slightly blurred. Early on, you move between wanting to understand “how reclaiming solidarity can heal France,” the gap between “ideal and real” France, and why solidarity has not fully materialized.
- Your strongest framing is in the last third: You want to propose a campaign to reclaim the original, egalitarian definition of solidarity in order to address contemporary social ills. Consider stating this precise intervention more clearly at the outset.

**Suggestion:**  
Add a tighter, explicit research question in your intro:  
- *“This research proposes to design a public campaign to reclaim the founding principles of French solidarity—to bridge the gap between aspiration and reality in contemporary France—by understanding historical perceptions, public attitudes, and identifying effective messengers.”*

### 2. **Balance between Description and Analysis**
- Some sections (especially those summarizing welfare benefits or describing political events) verge on being descriptive rather than analytical.
- The historical analysis is strong, but occasionally the proposal feels like it’s trying to do too much—explaining *why* solidarity failed, *how* perceptions endure, *what* reforms are needed, and *how* to design a campaign.

**Suggestion:**  
While the breadth is impressive, ensure every section tightly ties back to your research aim—designing the campaign. Frame even the descriptive sections as groundwork for effective intervention.

### 3. **Research Methods**
- The focus group design is well thought out—but you note that support from “less fortunate” French groups matters less than buy-in from elite classes (since elites have more power and voice). That’s a provocative observation, but you don’t explore its ethical and practical dimensions very deeply.
- It might be helpful to briefly justify the focus on changing elite perceptions vs. grassroots mobilization, and consider more explicitly how diverse voices will be represented and empowered.

**Suggestion:**  
Maybe add a line on risks (e.g., that a campaign only backed by elites could be seen as top-down and rejected by those it’s meant to help), or how you’ll mitigate this by feeding results of all focus groups into campaign design.

### 4. **Feasibility and Scope**
- The idea of a nationwide campaign is ambitious, and the plan to research which organizations, politicians, and businesses should back it is reasonable, but perhaps could benefit from more specificity.
- How will you ensure genuine, broad support? How will you deal with, or anticipate, potential backlash—especially in a climate of suspicion toward government/corporate messaging?

**Suggestion:**  
Briefly address possible obstacles to campaign legitimacy (“astroturfing” concerns, co-optation by political actors, divisiveness), even if just to acknowledge them.

### 5. **Comparative Angle**
- The comparisons to the Netherlands, Sweden, etc., are helpful, and your idea of using national mythologies/values to spur change is compelling.
- The analogy to the “American Dream” is illuminating. If you decided to develop this proposal further, you might want to reference additional cases beyond the US/France, or suggest what makes the French case especially instructive.

### 6. **Minor Polishing**
- A few sentences are long and could be broken up for clarity.
- Some repetition (“To do this, I must learn who has defined solidarity as an egalitarian notion…”) can be tightened.
- Be mindful about not overgeneralizing about French culture (e.g., “the French are a preserving society…a changing society…”), but rather, highlight diversity and contestation.

## **Conclusion**

This is an excellent senior undergraduate research proposal. It is ambitious, passionate, clever, and credible. Its main strengths are:
- The interdisciplinary synthesis of sociology, history, politics, and communications.
- The practical yet idealistic vision.
- The use of evidence and concrete policy suggestion (the public campaign).

You could improve by sharpening your research question, focusing the argument structure, and bracketing challenges to feasibility and elite/grassroots dynamics.

**Overall, this would surely receive high marks, and is a genuinely interesting project!** If you revise, clarify your intervention and anticipate critics, it could be even stronger.
