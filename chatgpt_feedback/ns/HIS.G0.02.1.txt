Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback on your paper, covering **thesis/argument, structure, use of evidence, style, and areas for improvement**.

## Overall Feedback

### 1. **Thesis and Argument**
**Strengths:**
- Your introduction clearly establishes the context of the pre-WWI period, questioning the myth of a “golden age” and highlighting both stability and acceleration of reform.
- The thesis is clear: beneath the surface of apparent stability, British society (1901–14) experienced accelerated and explicit challenges to the established order.

**Suggestions:**
- The thesis could be made even more explicit, perhaps in the final sentence of your intro: clearly state that these challenges amount to a “direct assault on the social, economic, and political settlement.”

### 2. **Organization and Structure**
**Strengths:**
- The paper is logically organized, moving from working-class activism, to the women’s movement, to Ireland, culminating in a strong conclusion.
- Each section flows well into the next and supports your overarching argument.

**Suggestions:**
- Each supporting paragraph starts with a strong topic sentence. Ensure that the first sentence of each new section signals the transition clearly.
- Occasionally, paragraph structure gets long or “listy.” Break up dense paragraphs for readability.

### 3. **Use of Evidence**
**Strengths:**
- You integrate primary figures (Brittain, Dangerfield, Roberts, Forster, etc.) and secondary lectures/scholarship effectively.
- Specific data (e.g., union membership statistics, women in the workforce) is incorporated to bolster your claims.
- Direct references and quotations help ground your discussion.

**Suggestions:**
- Synthesize secondary sources more—don’t just report; analyze or compare viewpoints between Roberts, Dangerfield, and Vicinus, especially when their perspectives diverge.
- Sometimes, references to “Lecture, [date]” could be more smoothly integrated or paraphrased for essay flow rather than citation alone.

### 4. **Analysis**
**Strengths:**
- There are strong moments of analysis, particularly with the suffrage and Irish Home Rule examples.
- Good attention to *why* challenges mattered (not just *that* they occurred).

**Suggestions:**
- Dig deeper into why some reforms/attacks succeeded or failed. For example, what about the broader culture enabled these direct challenges to gain momentum?
- Consider counterarguments more explicitly—was there significant pushback that helped maintain aspects of stability?

### 5. **Style and Clarity**
**Strengths:**
- Your prose is clear, academic, and often engaging, with effective paraphrasing and judicious quotes.
- Topic sentences are mostly clear and assertive.

**Suggestions:**
- Sometimes your sentences are long and dense. Vary length and structure for greater clarity and emphasis.
- Watch for passive voice and wordiness (e.g., “the event, as well as other violent strikes in the period, demonstrated trade unions’ facilitation of an assault on the settled economic system”—could be more concise).

### 6. **Conclusion**
**Strengths:**
- Your conclusion effectively restates your overall case, refers back to Sitwell/Brittain, and ties together the main themes.
- The reference to World War I as pushing change “even further” while challenges “began long before” is a strong closing touch.

**Suggestions:**
- A final sentence about broader implications—how these pre-war challenges shaped Britain during/after the war—could leave a lasting impression.

## **Final Comments**

You have written a strong, well-structured paper with good evidence and clear analysis. With some tightening of prose, deeper engagement with opposing perspectives, and a bit more synthesis among your sources, it could be even stronger. Your coverage of the intertwined crises of class, gender, and nation is especially well-chosen and supported.

**Overall: Excellent draft—polished, thoughtful, and analytically ambitious.**
