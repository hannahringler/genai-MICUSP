Certainly! Below is **detailed feedback** on your paper “Social/Organizational Aspects of Behavior.” I will comment on **strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement** including ideas about writing style, organization, content coverage, referencing, and clarity.

---

### Strengths

**1. Thorough Historical Context**
- You provide a solid overview of the historical development of social psychology and its intersections with both psychology and sociology.
- Mention of figureheads (e.g., Allport, Bernard) and key events (post-WWII developments) helps ground the discussion.

**2. Integration of Research and Theory**
- The inclusion of primary theories (e.g., Norm Theory, Triple Quandary Theory, Developmental Niche Theory) and up-to-date empirical findings (e.g., studies on normativity, cross-cultural parenting, stereotype activation) demonstrates a good grasp of the literature.

**3. Interdisciplinary Connections**
- The paper recognizes social psychology’s connections to developmental and organizational psychology, and its relationship with cultural variables, identity, and economic productivity. This breadth indicates an advanced understanding.

**4. Use of References**
- You reference a variety of sources, including classic works and contemporary lectures, showing engagement with both foundational and modern perspectives.

### Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement

**1. Organization and Flow**
- The structure could be improved for clarity. At times, the paper jumps between historical exposition, theory, and specific studies, making it challenging to follow a single thread.
    - **Suggestion:** Use subheadings or explicitly transition between history, major theories, current research, and future directions.

**2. Clarity and Jargon**
- Some sentences are complex or jargon-heavy (e.g., “visuo-spatial and linguistic norm”), which may obscure meaning for readers less familiar with the subject.
    - **Suggestion:** Aim for more concise sentences, and explain specialized terminology when first introduced.

**3. Depth of Analysis**
- While many topics are touched upon, some sections could use more depth or critical evaluation. For instance, disagreement between the integration attempts in the 1950s is mentioned but not explored in terms of lasting implications.
    - **Suggestion:** When mentioning a challenge or development, briefly reflect on its consequences or what it reveals about the field.

**4. Cohesion**
- The paper reads somewhat like an annotated list of studies and theories, rather than a synthesized narrative.
    - **Suggestion:** Draw more explicit connections between studies/theories and their practical or conceptual significance. For example, how did studies on normativity influence later research on prejudice?

**5. Concluding Statements**
- The conclusion is more of a preview of ongoing developments than a synthesis of what has been discussed.
    - **Suggestion:** Summarize key findings/themes and restate their broader implications for social/organizational psychology.

### Writing & Mechanics

**1. Minor Typos/Encoding**
- There are some odd characters (“AllportÆs”, “1950Æs”), likely due to encoding. Proofread and correct these for professional polish.
- Avoid repetition, e.g., references to “Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Papers” appear several times and can be omitted if not directly relevant.

**2. Reference Formatting**
- Reference formatting is generally good, but double-check consistency (italics, use of initials, proper line breaks). If following APA style, make sure all conventions are followed.

### Example of Revision

**Original:**  
“Peter Hegarty (2006) of the University of Surrey discussed theories that may account for visual and verbal representations for what is normal and abnormal. Norm theory, developed by Kahneman & Miller, states that references to category labels recruit exemplars, which are then averaged to form category norms.”

**Revision:**  
“Peter Hegarty (2006) examined how both visual and verbal cues shape our ideas of normality. According to norm theory (Kahneman & Miller), when we categorize people or behaviors, we mentally average past examples to create a ‘norm.’ Those that do not fit become noticeable exceptions.”

### Overall Evaluation

**This is a strong, well-researched overview that demonstrates understanding of both the history and current trends in social/organizational psychology.** With improvements in organization, synthesis, and clarity, it would be even more effective at communicating your knowledge to a broader audience.
