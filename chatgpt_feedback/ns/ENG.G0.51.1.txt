Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, both in terms of content and structure, as well as some notes on clarity, style, and mechanics:

**Paper Title:** Rejecting Colonial Memory

### **Strengths**

1. **Engagement with Scholarship and Primary Sources:**  
   You show a clear engagement with both Walter Benjamin’s theoretical framework and the primary texts (*Omeros* and *The English Patient*). The use of quotations and close reading of key moments (such as the transformation of Kip’s name) adds depth to your analysis.

2. **Focused Argument:**  
   You maintain a clear, focused thesis: that literary fiction (specifically postcolonial works) is a site for recovering and interrogating lost or suppressed collective memory. You provide effective examples to support this claim, particularly in your discussion of name transformation and myth.

3. **Comparative Approach:**  
   The paper does well to not just analyze each author/text in isolation but to draw connections and distinctions between Ondaatje and Walcott. This comparative framework adds richness to your argument.

4. **Awareness of Larger Implications:**  
   The paper does not get bogged down in plot summary. Instead, it considers the broader impact—how these literary strategies might empower readers from formerly colonized societies to reclaim identity and history.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Thesis Clarity and Positioning:**  
   The introduction is somewhat long and could benefit from more focus. Your central claim is present, but a more concise and pointed thesis statement placed near the end of your first paragraph would help orient your reader more clearly.

   *Suggestion:* Try something like:  
   “Through allusion, myth, and character development, Ondaatje and Walcott’s novels illustrate how colonialism suppresses collective memory, and use fiction as a means to recover or reconstruct those lost histories.”

2. **Organization and Flow:**  
   Although your argument is clear, the organization sometimes feels meandering. For example, the discussion of Kip’s name change drifts into broader comments before returning to specifics. Make sure each paragraph begins with a topic sentence linking back to your main argument, and keep examples tightly connected to that point.

3. **Use of Secondary Sources:**  
   The essay mainly uses Benjamin’s idea in the opening paragraph but could benefit from more sustained engagement throughout. You might briefly return to Benjamin when discussing Walcott and myth, for instance, to unify your theoretical lens.

4. **Mechanics and Style:**  
   There are a few grammar, punctuation, and wording issues that affect clarity. Here are some specific notes:
   - “This attempts maybe in relation to a specific history…” → Should be “These attempts may be in relation…”
   - “In another vain, it could be argued…” → Should be “In another vein…”
   - Make sure quotes are always integrated grammatically and contextually.
   - Proofread for awkward constructions, such as “The devolution of Kip’s name from Kirpal Singh shows brings light to one way…” (should be “shows one way…” or “brings to light one way…”).

5. **Arguments about Language:**  
   Your discussion of Ondaatje’s use of “pukkah” is interesting, but you could analyze it in more depth. What does the inclusion of indigenous language in English novels signify for postcolonial memory? Is it resistance, reclamation, or something else?

6. **Conclusion:**  
   The concluding paragraph is strong but can be improved by restating the thesis and summarizing specific findings from the body in a more pointed way—rather than generalizing about post-colonial experience, anchor your conclusion in the most compelling insights from your analyses of *Omeros* and *The English Patient*.

### **Quick Micro-Level Edits**

- “apart of the collective memory” → “a part of the collective memory”
- “As soon and the flashback of Kip’s time…” → “As soon as the flashback of Kip’s time…”
- “those people they colonized and controlled.” → “the people they colonized and controlled.”
- “The work is filled with such examples, but this is what makes the work so effective.” (awkward construction; consider splitting or clarifying.)

### **Summary**

**Overall, this is a thoughtful and well-supported essay that demonstrates strong textual analysis and awareness of postcolonial criticism.** Tighten the thesis, improve organization and clarity, and proofread for mechanical errors. With these adjustments, your paper would be even more persuasive and polished.
