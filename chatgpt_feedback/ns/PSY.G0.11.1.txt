Certainly! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, **“Psychology Underground of Power: Memo #1,”** focusing on strengths and areas for improvement:

---

## Strengths

### 1. **Unique and Relevant Topic**
- The focus on everyday power dynamics as revealed through cell phone use is both original and relevant in modern society.
- The use of relatable, real-life examples (e.g., answering styles, multitasking, how quickly people return calls) helps ground your analysis.

### 2. **Clear Organization**
- You organize your analysis effectively by breaking it down into answering, behavior during calls, conversation closings, and callback time. This logical flow is easy to follow.

### 3. **Personal Experience**
- Using your own life as evidence gives your paper authenticity and helps illustrate your points clearly.

### 4. **Insightful Observations**
- Noting how small behaviors can establish or reinforce power hierarchies is perceptive. Your attention to conversational nuances shows critical thinking.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Thesis Clarity**
- **Suggestion:** State a more explicit thesis in your introduction. For example: “This memo examines how subtle behaviors in cell phone use reveal and reinforce interpersonal power dynamics.”

### 2. **Depth of Analysis**
- You provide good examples, but your analysis can go deeper. For instance, tie your observations to psychological theories or concepts (e.g., social dominance, status cues, nonverbal power signaling).
- Consider referencing research or established theory if possible.

### 3. **Evidence Balance**
- Currently, most evidence is anecdotal (based on your own experiences). While personal examples are strong, try to reference a broader range of observations (peers, media, or literature if possible).

### 4. **Paragraph Transitions**
- Improve transitions between sections. Sometimes, it feels like you jump from one aspect to another without a linking sentence.
  - **Suggestion:** Use transition words or sentences (“Another way cell phone behavior reflects power is...”)

### 5. **Grammar and Style**
- Several minor grammar and wording issues (e.g., “reciprocal relationship where powered is either shared equally…” should be “where power is either shared equally...”).
- Proofread for typos, subject-verb agreement, and concise phrasing. Consider more formal language in places (avoid beginning with “I’ll” in academic tone).

### 6. **Conclusion**
- The conclusion is good but could be stronger by tying your observations back to your main argument. Emphasize the significance: Why should we care about these subtle power dynamics?

## Minor Comments

- **APA or citation style:** If this is for a formal assignment, ensure any sources (even your own experiences, if expected) are cited appropriately.
- **Title:** The title is interesting but could be clearer. Perhaps “The Psychology of Everyday Power Dynamics: Mobile Phone Interactions” would be more precise.

## Summary

**In summary:**  
You’ve written an engaging and insightful paper on a relevant topic using personal experience, and your observations are astute. To strengthen your work, clarify your thesis, deepen your analysis via psychological frameworks, diversify your evidence, improve transitions, and proofread for grammar.

**Overall, a solid first draft with lots of promise!**
