Absolutely! Here is a detailed feedback structured under key academic writing criteria:

---

**Title & Introduction**

- *Strengths:*  
  - The title, *Sustenance and Sacrifice: The Symbolic Relationship Between Humans and Animals in Genesis*, is clear and directly related to the content.
  - The introduction successfully establishes the main thematic concern of the paper: the evolving and symbolic relationship between humans and animals in Genesis.

- *Suggestions:*  
  - Consider sharpening the introduction with a clearer thesis statement outlining the specific arguments you will make throughout the essay.

---

**Content & Analysis**

- *Strengths:*  
  - Strong use of biblical passages (Genesis 1, 3, 8, 9) gives the argument solid textual grounding.
  - The paper insightfully explores changes in the human-animal relationship—pre- and post-flood, and links this to broader questions of sin, dominion, and sacrifice.
  - Good engagement with secondary sources, especially the use of *The New Oxford Annotated Bible* to provide editorial perspectives.

- *Suggestions:*  
  - While the essay raises interesting questions (e.g., why animals are permitted as food after the flood), it occasionally repeats these uncertainties without advancing a concrete argument. When possible, state a position, even if it’s provisional, supported by your evidence.
  - The point about God covering Adam and Eve with animal skins is intriguing, but needs more development. What do other biblical scholars say about this act? Could you briefly reference other sources for a richer interpretation?

---

**Organization & Structure**

- *Strengths:*  
  - Logical overall progression from Genesis 1 to Genesis 9, and then to deeper symbolic interpretations.
  - Clear paragraph structure for the most part.

- *Suggestions:*  
  - Some sections are overly summary-like (retelling what happened in Genesis) rather than analytical. Focus more on interpretation and less on narrative when restating biblical events.
  - The transition from analysis of dominion to the serpent’s role could be smoother. Consider using signposting language between sections (“Next, I will examine…”) to guide the reader.

---

**Use of Evidence & Citation**

- *Strengths:*  
  - Textual citations are frequent and specific (e.g., Genesis 1:28, Genesis 9:2-3).
  - The mention of *The New Oxford Annotated Bible* provides an academic anchor for the discussion.

- *Suggestions:*  
  - Try integrating more perspectives from biblical scholarship or theology to amplify your own analysis, especially for ambiguous interpretations.
  - Clarify referencing style: Right now, the citations are embedded in the text; you might use parenthetical citations or footnotes for clarity (as required by your assignment guidelines).

---

**Style & Clarity**

- *Strengths:*  
  - Generally clear, precise, and easy to follow.
  - Proper academic tone.

- *Suggestions:*  
  - Some sentences are wordy or repetitive (“The answers to these questions are not completely clear”), which could be streamlined.
  - Watch minor grammatical errors (e.g., “she subsequently gave the fruit to Adam and he ate” would be more cohesive as “she subsequently gave the fruit to Adam, who also ate”).
  - Avoid rhetorical questions in academic writing; instead, convert them into statements/hypotheses.

---

**Conclusion**

- *Strengths:*  
  - The conclusion succinctly reiterates the key points of the paper and links the discussion back to your thesis.

- *Suggestions:*  
  - Go a step further and briefly reflect on the broader implications of your analysis. Why does it matter how Genesis depicts humans and animals? How might this inform understandings of humanity, ethics, or religion today?

---

**Overall Assessment**

This is a thoughtful, textually-engaged, and well-organized undergraduate paper that demonstrates a good understanding of Genesis and its complexities. With deeper scholarly engagement and a little more analytical focus, it could be even stronger.  

**Final Tips:**  
- Offer your own argument about the symbolic nature, drawing on evidence and scholarship.
- Be as concise as possible—avoid repeating points.
- Proofread for minor grammar and style tweaks.

Great effort and insight!
