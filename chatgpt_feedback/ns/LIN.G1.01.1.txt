Certainly! Here is a structured feedback on the paper **"Recognizing Textual Entailment With a Modified BLEU Algorithm"**:

---

### 1. **Clarity and Organization**

**Strengths:**
- The paper is well-organized, beginning with a clear abstract and introduction that contextualize the problem of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE).
- Section headings and subheadings (e.g., “2 The Algorithm”, “3 Results and Performance”) effectively guide the reader.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some technical aspects (like the equations for BLEU scoring) could be explained in a more reader-friendly way, possibly including more illustrative examples or pseudocode.
- The transitions between sections can be abrupt; smoother linking sentences would help.

---

### 2. **Content and Depth**

**Strengths:**
- The overview of the RTE task and why BLEU is used as a baseline is thorough and informative.
- The comparison between the original and modified BLEU algorithms is clear, and the rationale for modification is well-argued.
- The coverage of the evaluation methodology and data sets is adequate.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The paper could benefit from a more detailed error analysis (i.e., what kinds of entailment errors are most common for the BLEU-based approaches?).
- The discussion about why brevity penalty harms RTE performance could be strengthened with more empirical examples.

---

### 3. **Analysis of Results**

**Strengths:**
- Results are quantified, with accuracy scores for each data set/algorithm, and figures/tables are used well.
- The author fairly assesses BLEU's limitations and explicitly prevents overclaiming by calling BLEU only a baseline.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The results section mentions differences between dev and test sets, but it lacks deeper analysis or hypotheses regarding why performance varied.
- The discussion of the cutoff point for BLEU scores could be made clearer for readers unfamiliar with such thresholding in practice.
- Confidence scores and their interpretation are only briefly addressed – a more thorough explanation would help.

---

### 4. **Research Context and Related Work**

**Strengths:**
- The paper references key works and submissions to the RTE challenges, situating itself clearly relative to prior work.
- The brief literature review in Section 4.2 offers helpful pointers to alternative methods.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- More specifics about top-performing RTE1 systems would improve context ("what made 58% possible, compared to 54% for BLEU?").
- There is room for a more critical discussion of how BLEU aligns with other possible baselines or why n-gram measures are popular despite their limits.

---

### 5. **Writing Style**

**Strengths:**
- The tone is informal but precise, and the writing is largely clear.
- Occasional humor and humility (e.g., "I do not think this is an area that warrants further work") make the paper engaging.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The informal tone, while friendly, occasionally comes at the expense of academic rigor. Slightly more formal phrasing and fewer first-person statements (“I can imagine”, “my other paper”) might be more suitable for a research article.
- Some sentences are complex and would benefit from splitting or restructuring for better readability.

---

### 6. **Figures, Tables, and Citations**

**Strengths:**
- The inclusion of figures to show accuracy/cutoff relationships is helpful.
- Citations are generally clear and appropriate.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The table comparing different algorithms could be given more prominence and discussed in more detail.
- Visual clarity: Some figures are referenced in a way that assumes direct visibility—make sure each is clearly numbered and described.

---

### 7. **Critical Reflection and Forward-Looking Discussion**

**Strengths:**
- The author honestly assesses BLEU’s limitations both as a baseline and as a standalone RTE tool.
- The concluding section suggests promising future directions and incorporates metaphors ("trees and rocket ships") to help conceptualize progress in RTE.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The forward-looking section could reference more recent developments or touch on neural methods/fine-tuning (depending on the paper's date).
- The discussions on alternative approaches (tree-edit distance, atomic propositions, etc.) are brief; suggesting how these might integrate with BLEU could be helpful.

---

## **Summary**

**Overall, this is a solid, honest, and insightful paper for its context. It demonstrates:**

- Clear understanding of BLEU and RTE,
- Care in experimental methodology,
- Willingness to interpret results critically.

**To strengthen the paper:**

- Provide more experiential, tangible examples for technical choices,
- Further analyze the nature of errors and performance differences,
- More fully contextualize with recent or alternative methods.
