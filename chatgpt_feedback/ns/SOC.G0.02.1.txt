Certainly! Here is a detailed feedback on your paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

---

## Strengths

**1. Clear Structure and Organization**
- Your paper is well-organized, with a logical flow between the introduction, argument, evaluation, and reflection. This makes your critique easy to follow.

**2. Thorough Summary and Understanding**
- You demonstrate a strong grasp of Erik Olin Wright’s four theories explaining poverty and succinctly summarize each one. The use of direct quotations (e.g., “some people are simply not intelligent enough to compete in this modern world”) shows good engagement with the text.
- The summary of the Shmoo comic illustrative example is well-done and effectively supports your explanation of Wright’s arguments.

**3. Critical Engagement and Original Thought**
- You not only summarize Wright’s arguments but critically engage with them, especially when analyzing the coherence between his diagnosis of the problem and his proposed solutions.
- The distinction you draw between reducing versus eliminating poverty is thoughtful and highlights a possible contradiction in Wright’s framework.

**4. Insightful Reflection**
- Your reflection at the end shows self-awareness and growth in your understanding. Highlighting the need for creativity and collaboration in addressing complex social issues is a valuable point.

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Thesis Statement Clarity**
- While your introduction covers a lot of ground, your thesis statement (“I argue that though this argument is convincing, the solutions that Wright proposes to mitigate the problem of poverty do not successfully support the fundamental basis of his thesis.”) could be made clearer. Consider tightening it up, so your reader is immediately clear on your main evaluative claim.
    - *Suggestion*: “While Wright convincingly argues that poverty is inherent to capitalism, his proposed solutions are inconsistent with this diagnosis and insufficiently address the needs of the underclass.”

**2. Transitions and Flow**
- At times, transitions between sections and within paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the introduction could more explicitly preview the structure of your paper, and topic sentences could more clearly flag when you're shifting from summary to critique to reflection.

**3. Depth of Critique**
- Your critique is strong, especially regarding the inconsistency between Wright’s argument and solutions. However, consider engaging a bit more with possible counterarguments or with examples from the real world (other than Sweden) that might support or challenge Wright’s perspective.

**4. Addressing Alternative Approaches**
- You advocate for a blended approach between class analysis and liberal reformist perspectives near the end. This is excellent, but it could be developed further. How might these approaches complement each other in practice? Is there any scholarship or real-world policy that illustrates this hybrid method?

**5. Use of Evidence**
- When critiquing Wright’s suggestions for the underclass, you argue that policy is needed to enhance skills and employability. If you can, briefly mention examples of such policies (education programs, job training, etc.) or research that supports their effectiveness.

**6. Proofreading and Conciseness**
- The writing is quite strong overall, but some sentences are wordy or repetitive. For example: “The working class first prefer that everyone gets shmoos, because in this case not only would they have the basic necessities of life provided for them, but so too would the capitalists, increasing the chances that wages would be increased and/or more workers would be hired.” Try to break up or rephrase long sentences to increase clarity.
- Watch for typos, e.g., "saavy" should be "savvy".
