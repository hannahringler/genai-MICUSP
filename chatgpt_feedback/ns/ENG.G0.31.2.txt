Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, **“Fairy Tales and the Context of Disney”**:

---

### **Strengths**

**1. Strong Grasp of Textual Analysis and Integration of Sources**
- Your paper demonstrates an in-depth understanding of Jack Zipes’s arguments and does an excellent job weaving his ideas with your own analysis. You clearly outline Zipes’s perspective on the evolution of fairy tales from oral to literary forms, and the impact of industrialization and Disney on these stories.
- You provide well-placed quotes with proper context, which strengthens your argument and shows strong close reading skills.

**2. Organization and Structure**
- The essay follows a logical structure: you introduce Zipes and his central concerns, move through the historical context, and then delve into Disney specifically.
- Paragraphs are focused and generally flow well from one to the next.

**3. Consideration of Nuance**
- The paper provides a balanced view of Zipes’s critique of Disney, noting both his praise (for innovation and making fairy tales accessible) and his criticisms (commercialization, reinforcement of social stratification, etc.).
- You raise good questions about the differences between sanitized/literary tales and oral/folk tales, which adds depth.

**4. Contextualization**
- You successfully place Disney’s films in their social and historical context (e.g., the relationship between Snow White and the Great Depression era).

### **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Thesis Clarity**
- Your central thesis is implied rather than explicitly stated. Early in the introduction, spell out your main argument (i.e., your stance on Zipes’s critique, or what you believe Disney’s real legacy for fairy tales is).

**2. Original Analysis**
- Much of the essay summarizes Zipes’s argument. Try to extend your own analysis further: do you largely agree with Zipes? Are there aspects where you disagree? For example, you could question his notion that Disney’s tales primarily reinforce patriarchy or propose that Disney brought about some positive communal storytelling through a new medium (film).

**3. More Textual Evidence from Disney**
- When discussing Disney’s works, give more specific examples from the films themselves (e.g., particular scenes or characters from “Snow White”) to support the analysis of gender roles, class, or American values.

**4. Conclusion**
- The conclusion restates the complexity of Zipes’s evaluation, but a stronger final statement about the legacy of Disney’s fairy tales would make your paper more impactful. Consider closing with a reflection on why it still matters today how fairy tales are presented in media.

**5. Minor Clarity & Stylistic Points**
- Occasionally, your sentence structure can be a little cumbersome. For example, “What is not clear, however, is whether this sanitation resulted in vastly different moral and social lessons” could be more direct: “However, it remains unclear if sanitizing these tales significantly changed their moral lessons.”
- Watch for minor typos (e.g., “literary rates spread”—probably intended “literacy rates spread”).

### **Summary Statement**

This is a thoughtful, well-organized paper that thoughtfully engages with Zipes’s arguments and places Disney’s adaptations in both historical and social context. Moving forward, strive to make your thesis more explicit, deepen your own critical voice, and anchor your points with specific textual analysis from both Zipes and the Disney texts. With these improvements, your work will be even more sophisticated and persuasive.
