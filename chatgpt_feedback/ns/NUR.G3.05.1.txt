Absolutely! Here’s detailed feedback on your paper, **“A Pilot Study of the Knowledge, Attitude and Self-Efficacy Asthma Questionnaire with Pediatric Revisions”**. Feedback is organized according to key aspects: **clarity, organization, methods, analysis, strengths, limitations, writing mechanics,** and **suggestions for improvement.**

---

### **1. Clarity and Focus**
**Strengths:**
- The **purpose** of the study is clearly stated in the abstract and introduction.
- Rationales for pediatric revisions to the KASE-AQ are well explained.
- Definitions and explanations of “knowledge,” “attitude,” and “self-efficacy” are clear and grounded in literature.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider more directly stating specific research questions or hypotheses near the end of the Introduction for added clarity.

---

### **2. Literature Review**
**Strengths:**
- The literature review is thorough, addressing various pediatric asthma assessment tools and discussing their strengths and weaknesses.
- You justify the need for a pediatric adaptation of the KASE-AQ by highlighting gaps in existing tools.

**Suggestions:**
- The literature review is long and detailed, which is good, but could be improved by clearly summarizing the main findings at the end of the section.
- Consider grouping tools into categories (e.g., those assessing QoL, those with parental input only, self-efficacy tools) for easier reading.

---

### **3. Methods**
**Strengths:**
- The **rationale for age range** and **inclusion criteria** is clearly described.
- Modifications to the KASE-AQ for pediatric use are logically explained, with good examples.
- The procedure is robust and ethical (assent and consent clearly described).

**Suggestions:**
- The explanation of statistical methods could be moved from results to a brief, dedicated “Analysis” subsection within Methods.
- Specify which software or tool was used for reliability analysis, even if only basic tools (Excel, SPSS, etc.).

---

### **4. Results**
**Strengths:**
- Clear reporting of participant demographics.
- The use of tables is appropriate and helpful (e.g., for sample descriptors, feedback, comments).
- Internal consistency measures (Cronbach’s alpha) are properly reported.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider providing more details on **scoring**, especially conversion from raw scores to percent or other standardized measurement if used.
- With such a small sample, consider also reporting descriptive statistics for each domain (mean, SD, range) in a table for easier comparison.

---

### **5. Discussion and Limitations**
**Strengths:**
- You thoughtfully interpret the meaning behind the findings (e.g., ceiling effects, limitations with reverse-scored items).
- Limitations are candidly discussed with regard to sample size, population homogeneity, and tool length.

**Suggestions:**
- Offer a more explicit summary of **“implications for practice,”** for example, how clinicians or educators might use the findings.
- Consider including potential strategies for shortening the instrument or for improving vocabulary accessibility based on your pilot feedback.
- Since you discuss plans for future research, it would be good to specify what changes you would make for a larger sample study.

---

### **6. Writing and Style**
**Strengths:**
- The writing is generally clear, professional, and well referenced.
- Definitions, processes, and rationales are clearly provided.

**Suggestions:**
- There are some minor **typos**, especially in the children’s comments section and occasionally within the main text (“their” vs. “there”; “medications” vs. “mediations”), but these are few.
- Some sentences could be more concise; avoid excessive wordiness (e.g., “This weakness…” instead of “A final weakness of note is…”).

---

### **7. Formatting and Citations**
**Strengths:**
- The structure is logical: Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review, Methods, Results, Discussion, Limitations, Conclusion, Appendices, References.
- Appropriate use of appendices for survey tools.

**Suggestions:**
- Citation formatting (in-line and in references) seems accurate, but ensure APA or your field’s specific requirements are strictly followed (e.g., journal titles italicized, volume(issue), page numbers).

---

### **8. Overall Strengths**
- Addresses an **important gap** in pediatric asthma education assessment.
- Pilot results are thoroughly and honestly assessed.
- The demonstration of reliability is a strong point for future research.

### **Potential Areas for Enhancement**
1. **Abstract Clarity:** Include specific domain means, not just Cronbach’s alpha, in the abstract.
2. **Research Questions:** Explicitly list them.
3. **Tables/Figures:** Consider a summary table of all psychometric results.
4. **Vocabulary:** Given child feedback, discuss how vocabulary could be further piloted or pre-tested.
5. **Reverse Scoring:** Propose example revisions of problematic items based on your findings.

---

## **Summary**
This paper is a well-structured, well-written pilot study addressing the important issue of measuring knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy in children with asthma. The methods are appropriate, results are reported transparently, and the limitations are honestly discussed. With a few adjustments for clarity, conciseness, and some expansion in future implications, your work would make a strong contribution to the field of pediatric asthma education research.

**Great job! If you need more specific feedback (e.g., on the survey wording, tables, references), just let me know!**
