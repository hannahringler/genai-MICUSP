Absolutely! Here is detailed feedback on your paper, “Malaria in the Twenty-first Century.” The comments address both strengths and areas for improvement, focusing on clarity, structure, argumentation, evidence, and writing mechanics.

---

**Strengths**

1. **Clear Structure and Organization**
   - The paper is well organized into sections (Disease and Transmission, The State of the Problem, Control of Malaria, US Involvement, Cost/Benefit Analysis, and References), making it easy for readers to follow your argument and findings.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - You thoroughly cover the biology, epidemiology, and control measures for malaria. There is a good balance between scientific background and discussion of public health/ policy concerns.

3. **Use of Evidence**
   - You reference relevant data and cite credible sources like the CDC and WHO to ground your recommendations.

4. **Relevance and Timeliness**
   - Linking the discussion to US policy and global health concerns makes your paper relevant and engaging for a broad audience.

**Areas for Improvement**

1. **Clarity and Depth of Scientific Explanation**
   - While you provide a good overview, some sections could benefit from expanded scientific explanation. For example, a deeper explanation of the parasite's lifecycle and drug resistance would help reinforce how these factors complicate eradication efforts.
   - Avoid redundancy (e.g., for DDT, its risks and benefits are re-explained several times).

2. **Critical Engagement with Evidence**
   - Your cost-benefit analysis, while comparative, sometimes downplays complexities. For instance, the suggestion to choose DDT for its cost-efficiency doesn’t engage with broader environmental and regulatory debates, nor with resistance evolution in detail.
   - The U.S. policy recommendation is clear, but lacks engagement with the political, logistical, and ethical complexities of international health aid—e.g., how assistance is delivered, potential for misuse, sustainability, or consequences of reduced oversight.

3. **Tone and Voice**
   - Some sentences and sections lean toward a conversational or opinionated tone (e.g., “there are bigger issues at stake,” or “in perspective is it not”). For an academic report, strive for a consistently objective, formal register.
   - Avoid colloquial phrases such as “able bodied people can be put to better use.”

4. **Data and Statistics**
   - Check for accuracy and update statistics if possible; some data may be outdated (referenced as from the 1990s and early 2000s). Phrases such as “200 billion people” is likely a typo (global population hasn’t reached this figure; more likely “2 billion”).
   - When you make numerical recommendations (e.g., U.S. spending $3 million), provide more justification for those amounts, perhaps by comparing them to costs per life saved, disease burden prevented, or other nations’ benchmarks.

5. **Reference Quality and Citation Style**
   - Sources are credible, but referencing could be improved with in-text citations (instead of just listing references at the end), making it easier for readers to trace specific claims.
   - Use a consistent citation format (APA, MLA, etc.) as per your assignment’s requirements.

6. **Proofreading and Mechanics**
   - Minor grammatical issues (“bring” instead of “brings,” awkward phrase structure, missing words).
   - Watch for consistency in terminology (e.g., “bednets treat with pyrethroids” should be “bed nets treated with pyrethroids”).
   - Section headings could be bolded or more clearly separated for easier navigation.
   - Conclude with a separate summary or concluding remarks paragraph.

**Overall Assessment**
This is a solid and well-structured undergraduate report demonstrating an understanding of malaria epidemiology and control strategies, and linking the topic to current policy. The analysis would be enriched by deeper critical engagement with the complexities of global health interventions, more careful use of statistics, and a more professional tone throughout. With these improvements, your paper could be an excellent contribution to a public health or biology course.
