Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on your paper “Race and the Frequency of Developing Type II Diabetes,” including strengths and areas for improvement:

---

## Strengths

1. **Clear Topic and Relevance**  
   - The paper addresses a timely and important issue: the intersection of genetics, race, and the prevalence of type II diabetes.
   - You effectively highlight the seriousness and urgency of type II diabetes as a global and national health concern.

2. **Integration of Statistics**  
   - Good use of statistics (e.g., the number of diabetics and prediabetics in the U.S.) to set the context and underscore the magnitude of the problem.

3. **Use of Expert Opinion**  
   - Quoting a medical expert adds authority and credibility to your discussion of diagnosis and treatment disparities.

4. **Critical Reflection on Race and Genetic Variation**  
   - You thoughtfully critique the tendency to conflate race with genetic risk, explaining the potential harms of this oversimplification.

5. **Awareness of Policy and Research Implications**  
   - The paper shows an understanding of how scientific and social constructs can influence policy, research directions, and patient care.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Clarity and Organization**  
   - **Thesis Statement:** Your main argument could be clearer. Right now, the focus shifts between statistics, genetics, pharmaceutical interests, and social constructs. A stronger, more explicit thesis in your introduction would help.
   - **Transitions:** Some paragraphs jump from one idea to the next (e.g., from global trends to pharmaceutical involvement) without clear transitions. Use topic sentences and transitional phrases to better guide the reader.

2. **Evidence and Citation**  
   - While you cite a medical expert, most statistics and claims lack citations. Where did the numbers come from? Supporting major claims with reliable sources (e.g., CDC, medical journals) will strengthen your argument.

3. **Depth and Examples**  
   - When discussing how focusing on “race” rather than genetic variation can be problematic, give concrete examples. How has this played out in research or clinical settings? Are there studies that demonstrate these negative effects?

4. **Definition of Terms**  
   - “Race,” “genetic variation,” and “insulin resistance” are used, but not always clearly defined for a general audience. Consider a brief definition when these terms are first introduced.

5. **Grammar and Style**  
   - There are several minor grammatical and stylistic errors. For example:
     - “one of the fastest growing diseases within the developed world.” (Consider: “in the developed world.”)
     - “total lose of life” (should be “total loss of life”)
     - “effects” should be “affects” in “How biological variation effects diabetes...”
   - Some sentences are overly long or awkward. Breaking them up or rephrasing for clarity would improve readability.

6. **Conclusion**  
   - The paper ends with a warning about the dangers of racial typification but lacks a strong concluding summary. Consider explicitly summarizing your argument and suggesting concrete next steps for research or public health policy.
