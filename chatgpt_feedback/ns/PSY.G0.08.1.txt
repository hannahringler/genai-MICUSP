Absolutely! Here’s some detailed feedback on the research paper *“Subliminal Message Effects on Color Preference and Self Esteem”*:

---

## **Strengths**

**1. Clear Structure:**  
The paper is well-organized and follows the structure expected in a scientific research report (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References).

**2. Relevant Topic:**  
Subliminal messaging and its effects on subjective measures such as self-esteem and color preference is both intriguing and relevant, especially given its real-world implications in marketing and psychology.

**3. Use of Established Measures:**  
Utilizing the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale adds validity to the measurement of self-esteem.

**4. Consideration of Experimental Controls:**  
Attempts were made to control for extraneous variables (e.g., wearing colors other than black, red, or blue).

**5. Critical Discussion:**  
The Discussion section honestly acknowledges limitations, including sample size, possible ceiling effects, and methodological issues, and offers logical suggestions for future research.

## **Areas for Improvement**

**1. Sample Size:**  
You correctly identify your sample size (N=14) as a major limitation. With only 7 participants in each group, the study is severely underpowered to detect anything but large effects. This makes statistical significance unlikely and limits the generalizability of the results. Future research should aim for a much larger sample.

**2. Statistical Analysis:**  
The reporting of ANOVA results is good, but the presentation could be more precise. For example, when using F(1,12) = .000, p = 1.000, it should be accompanied by effect sizes (e.g., eta squared) and confidence intervals if possible. Also, make sure you report whether assumptions of ANOVA (normality, homogeneity of variance) were checked.

**3. Depth of Literature Review:**  
The introduction mentions a few past studies, but doesn't delve deeply into mechanisms or broader debates in the literature. Consider expanding your review to include more recent and diverse findings and present both positive and null results from other work.

**4. Experimental Controls:**  
Although some efforts were made to avoid color priming, more could have been done to ensure a neutral environment. The room’s existing color influences are noted as problematic and should be addressed more rigorously in the design phase if repeated.

**5. Clarity and Grammar:**  
There are several typographical and grammatical errors throughout (e.g., "sujective," "straegeies," "ablity," "presented for too short a time"). These detract from the professionalism of the paper. Proofreading before submission is essential.

**6. Method Details:**  
Some procedural points could use clarification. For example, how exactly was the subliminal message inserted (duration, visual salience, validation that it was below threshold)? Was random assignment truly random? How were participants blinded to conditions?

**7. Reporting of Data:**  
The use of Table 1 is helpful, but a figure (such as a bar graph for pre- and post-test scores) would aid in visualizing trends. Additionally, more commentary on the actual numerical results would be beneficial.

**8. Ethics:**  
A brief mention of informed consent and IRB/ethics approval (if applicable) should be included.

**9. Theoretical Implications:**  
Beyond acknowledging limitations, what do (even non-significant) trends suggest theoretically? Is there room to discuss why subliminal messages may work in some domains but not others, or why certain types of self-esteem might be more malleable?

## **Overall Assessment**  
This is a solid undergraduate research paper with a thoughtful approach and honest appraisal of its findings. The study design is clever and relevant, but greatly hampered by sample size and methodological confounds. The paper would benefit from tighter editing, a broader literature review, and deeper consideration of theoretical implications.

---

### **Suggestions for Revision/Future Work**
- Recruit a larger and more diverse sample.
- Strengthen environmental controls during testing.
- Include more detail on the nature of the subliminal manipulation.
- Expand literature review and connect findings to theory more explicitly.
- Proofread for clarity and grammar.
- Add visual data representations (graphs).
- Mention ethical considerations.

**In summary:**  
Promising idea and honest evaluation, but substantial improvements are necessary for publication-level quality. Keep at it!
