Absolutely! Here’s detailed, constructive feedback on your paper, focusing on thesis, structure, evidence, analysis, style, and areas for improvement:

---

**1. Thesis & Focus**

**Strengths:**  
Your thesis is clear and sophisticated: you argue that Chaucer’s presentation of the Pardoner (and other religious figures) is a deliberate contradiction that serves as biting critique of 14th-century religion. You consistently return to this idea throughout the paper.

**Suggestions:**  
Consider making your thesis statement even more explicit in your introduction. You hint at it strongly (“an intricate condemnation of common contemporary religious practices”) but a slightly more concise thesis at the end of your first paragraph would help orient the reader.

---

**2. Organization & Structure**

**Strengths:**  
You follow a logical progression:  
- Begin with the Pardoner’s place among the pilgrims  
- Move to analysis of his physical and behavioral traits  
- Examine Chaucer’s literary techniques (irony, juxtaposition, rhyme)  
- Follow with the Pardoner’s Tale and its broader symbolism  
- Broaden to include other religious characters  
- Conclude with the significance to Chaucer’s critique as a whole

**Suggestions:**  
Your paragraphs are generally well-focused, but a few become quite long. Breaking some blocks into two (especially where you shift from detailed close reading to broader critical points) would improve readability.

---

**3. Evidence & Analysis**

**Strengths:**  
You skillfully use textual evidence, quoting both Chaucer’s language and referencing specific lines. You interpret meaningfully and connect these observations to your thesis—e.g., the analysis of rhyme (“goot” and “Rome”) and physical descriptions.

**Suggestions:**  
- Occasionally, you reference line numbers (GP I.542-544) or use in-text references like (MP I.3120) that may not be familiar unless the reader has the edition you’re using. Briefly identifying which sections (e.g., “General Prologue,” “Miller’s Prologue”) would help readers.
- When discussing the Prioress, Monk, and Friar in relation to the Pardoner, you might include a specific quote or paraphrase from their descriptions to tighten the link.

---

**4. Depth of Argument & Critical Insight**

**Strengths:**  
You go beyond surface observations, considering Chaucer’s irony, the narrator’s biases, and how the Pardoner operates both as character and symbol. You’re especially insightful in connecting Chaucer’s critique of the Pardoner to a wider critique of the church.

**Suggestions:**  
- The section comparing other religious characters to the Pardoner could be slightly expanded. For instance, more direct comparison (perhaps a sentence or two on how Chaucer treats these characters differently stylistically) would sharpen your point that “the Friar is admired by Chaucer’s narrator, he is no less guilty of similar sins.”
- When you mention the “disconnect between religious preaching and religious practice,” you could briefly acknowledge the Parson, whom you note as an ideal figure, to show you’re aware Chaucer also presents positive models.

---

**5. Style & Clarity**

**Strengths:**  
Your writing is generally clear and academic. You use precise vocabulary and your sentence structure’s varied and engaging. Your tone is analytical but not dry.

**Suggestions:**  
- Occasionally, your sentences are quite long and complex, which can obscure your point. Try reading aloud to spot places to break up ideas into shorter sentences.
- There are a few times you slip into passive voice or abstract phrasing—try to keep your subject clear (“Chaucer shows...” rather than “It is shown...”).

---

**6. Use of Secondary Sources**

**Observation:**  
Your only cited text is Chaucer himself. While this is fine and keeps the focus on your close reading, you might consider referencing one or two critical sources (even in brief), especially if this is for a higher-level course. This can help situate your argument in the ongoing scholarly conversation.

---

**7. Formatting & Citations**

- Your MLA/APA citation style is good, but include page or line numbers in citations where possible and standardize formatting for clarity.
- The “Work Cited” should be “Works Cited.”
- The text includes some repeated attributions to the Michigan Corpus—ensure these are not in your final submitted draft.

---

**8. Conclusion**

**Strengths:**  
Your conclusion does a good job drawing together the broader implications of your argument and restating the significance of Chaucer’s critique.

**Suggestions:**  
Consider more strongly emphasizing what this means for readers: Does Chaucer offer hope for reform? Is his critique ultimately cynical, or restorative? What is the relevance for modern readers?

---

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a well-argued, insightful essay with strong close reading and a sophisticated understanding of Chaucer’s use of irony and contradiction. With minor adjustments for paragraph structure, citation, and maybe tightening or clarifying in spots, it would be even stronger.
