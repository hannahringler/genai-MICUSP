# genai-MICUSP
This repository contains code and data for my chapter "Differences in generative AIâ€™s feedback to writing by native and non-native English-speaking students" in *Data-driven approaches to generative AI and writing research*, edited by M. Vetter, J. Jiang, B. Lucia, and I. Farag (WAC Clearinghouse, forthcoming). In this study, I asked Gemini (2.0 Flash) and ChatGPT (4.1) "Can you give me feedback on this paper?" for all papers in [MICUSP](https://micusp.elicorpora.info/main), and analyzed for differences in the feedback based on whether the writer was a native or non-native English speaker.

In particular, this repository contains the following:
<ol>
<li>Python scripts for generating responses from both Gemini and ChatGPT, using their APIs</li>
<li>Corpora of the feedback from both Gemini and ChatGPT</li>
</ol>

Please use this data freely for your own research purposes, with appropriate citation of the aforementioned chapter.
