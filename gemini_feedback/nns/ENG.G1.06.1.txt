Okay, I've read through your paper. Here's a breakdown of my feedback, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

This is a well-researched and insightful analysis of intergenerational trauma in Nora Okja Keller's *Comfort Woman*. You demonstrate a strong understanding of trauma theory and apply it effectively to the novel. Your argument is clear, and you support it with textual evidence and engagement with relevant scholarship. The paper is well-structured and demonstrates a sophisticated level of critical thinking.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Argument:** You clearly establish your thesis about the intergenerational transmission of trauma in the novel and consistently develop it throughout the paper.
*   **Solid Theoretical Framework:** Your use of trauma theory (Danieli, van der Kolk, Laub, etc.) is well-integrated and supports your analysis effectively.
*   **Excellent Textual Analysis:** You provide compelling textual evidence from the novel to support your claims, and your interpretations are nuanced and insightful.
*   **Engagement with Scholarship:** You engage thoughtfully with other critics and scholars, incorporating their ideas to strengthen your argument and demonstrating a broad understanding of the topic.
*   **Clear Structure and Organization:** The paper follows a logical progression, with clear topic sentences and transitions that guide the reader through your analysis.
*   **Sophisticated Language and Style:** Your writing is clear, precise, and demonstrates a strong command of academic language.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Nuance in Conclusion:** While the conclusion effectively summarizes your argument, it could benefit from a bit more nuance. Acknowledge the complexities of trauma and its representation in literature, rather than framing it as a neat resolution with forgiveness. A slight qualification or reflection on the limitations of the novel's ending could add depth.
*   **Balance in Addressing Akiko:** The paper focuses on Beccah and her relationship to Akiko’s trauma. It may be helpful to more fully account for Akiko’s experience, especially regarding the shamanism that she practices. It may be helpful to look into scholarship on shamanism and trauma.
*   **Clarify some connections:** Sometimes the connections that you draw between literary theory and the text require more explicit articulation. Don’t assume that the reader will always see these connections.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Consider adding a sentence or two that more directly states the significance of studying intergenerational trauma, especially in the context of "comfort women." Why is this an important area of inquiry? This will strengthen the impact of your thesis.

*   **Page 1, Note 2:** The information presented in footnote 2 could potentially be integrated into the main body of the paper, possibly in an expanded introductory section. This could provide a more comprehensive overview of the challenges in researching the intergenerational consequences of this specific trauma.

*   **Page 4, Note 4:** Consider whether Akiko's shamanism is an effective way of coping with her trauma, or if her practice leads to additional problems for Beccah.

*   **Page 9:** When discussing Akiko's and Beccah's shared acts of bodily restriction, it may be helpful to emphasize the distinct differences between the actors' roles. Akiko's actions were performed out of coercion while Beccah's were performed as a maladaptive response to trauma.

*   **Conclusion:** Instead of simply stating that Beccah halts the cycle of trauma, you could explore the ongoing challenges and complexities of living with intergenerational trauma, even after acts of forgiveness. You could also reflect on the limitations of literature in fully representing the lived experience of trauma.

**Overall:**

This is a strong paper that demonstrates a high level of understanding and critical thinking. By addressing the suggestions above, you can further refine your argument and enhance the overall impact of your analysis. Remember to proofread carefully before submitting your final version.

I hope this feedback is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
