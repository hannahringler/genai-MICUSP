Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can provide feedback.  I'll focus on areas where there's room for improvement in clarity, organization, and technical rigor.

**Overall Impressions:**

*   The paper attempts to address a complex design problem (vehicle safety).
*   The paper goes through several design steps, but struggles with clarity.
*   There are significant issues with technical writing, including vague language, unclear explanations, and missing connections between calculations and design decisions.
*   Organization could be improved to better flow.
*   There are instances of incorrect grammar.

**Detailed Feedback:**

**General Points:**

1.  **Clarity of Objectives:** State explicitly at the beginning the primary goal(s) of the design (e.g., "The primary goal of this design is to maximize safety while minimizing the increase in vehicle weight and adhering to a target price of $25,000"). This gives the reader context.

2.  **Logical Flow:** The paper jumps around in places. Try to ensure that each step flows logically from the previous one. Explain *why* you're doing each step.

3.  **Explanations:** You need to provide more detailed explanations for each decision. Don't just state a conclusion; explain *how* you arrived at that conclusion. For example, when you adjust the mass of subsystems, explain the rationale for the *specific* increases in each subsystem.

4.  **Technical Language:** Be more precise with technical language. For example, instead of saying "Safety - material" to describe an adjusted subsystem, explain *what* material you are referring to (e.g., "High-strength steel").

5.  **Connect Calculations to Design:** After performing calculations, clearly state how the results inform your design decisions.  For example, if you calculate a required bending stiffness, explain how that stiffness requirement affects the selection of beam sizes or materials.

6.  **Units:** Be consistent with units. Use standard SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds, Newtons, etc.) when possible.

7.  **Figures and Tables:**
    *   *Captions:* All figures and tables *must* have clear and descriptive captions. The captions should explain what the figure/table shows and *why* it's important.
    *   *References:* Refer to each figure/table within the text of the paper. For example, "As shown in Table 2, the adjusted subsystems are…"

**Specific Comments on Sections:**

*   **Problem Statement:** Good start, but "enough cargo space" is vague. Quantify this requirement.

*   **Step 1. Interpret the customer description:** The "Design Description" section is weak. What *specific* design features are you implementing to address the customer's needs? How does high performance in crash tests translate into design decisions?

*   **Step 2. Estimate the vehicle mass:**
    *   The mass estimation process seems reasonable, but what are the *limitations* of using the 'MassCompRev5' method? Are there uncertainties associated with it?
    *   Be explicit about the calculations. Show how you arrived at the total gross vehicle mass.
    *   1950 kg -> Needs units after.

*   **Step 3. Adjust the mass of subsystems:**
    *   As mentioned earlier, the rationale for each adjustment needs to be clear and justified.
    *   "+" needs space after e.g. +5kg
    *   Explain the influence factor that you put in Table 3.

*   **Step 4. Determine numerical structural requirements:**
    *   (a) Bending moment diagrams: What does the "assumed mass of an engine to be 300 kg" mean in terms of design decision?
    *   Need to specify what kind of material is used.
    *   Clarify this diagram by defining what kind of material is used, what are the dimensions in the diagram, and what specific bending is this diagram referencing.
    *   (B) What are the specific design implications of the bending moment diagrams.
    *   In the torsion section, specify what material is used.
    *   The torsional stiffness seems much too high. Ensure there isn't an error within calculations.

*   **(F) Front crush space available:** This needs more information. Are you showing the front crash space in the current vehicle, or one from which you took inspiration? This is not clear.

*   **Step 5. The first order model analysis:**
    *   (A)  More details about why this vehicle design will make it safer. It is too vague at the moment.
    *   Why rectangular cross section beams?
    *   [2] Design for torsional stiffness: This section is not clear in why a torsional stiffness is needed, and how it can be properly put into use.
    *   For design for bending/torsion section, make it more clear what material you are using, why you are using it, and how you can properly test it.

*   **Step 8. Estimate the structure mass:**
    *   What are the materials used, why are they being used, and what dimensions are they?
    *   "Density [kg/mm3]" need units after

**Specific Grammar Issues:**

*   "Accordingly our team concentrated…" should be "Accordingly, our team concentrated…"
*   "…so that our design does not incorporate any safety factor"  This sounds strange. Most designs *do* incorporate safety factors.  Did you mean that you are *explicitly* calculating the worst-case scenario instead of using a global safety factor?  Rephrase to clarify.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1.  **Revise Based on Feedback:** Carefully address each of the points raised above.
2.  **Seek Peer Review:** Ask a classmate or colleague to review your paper and provide additional feedback.
3.  **Focus on Clarity:** As you revise, constantly ask yourself if your explanations are clear and easy to understand.
4.  **Iterate:** Design is an iterative process. Don't be afraid to revisit earlier steps and make changes as you learn more.

By focusing on these areas, you can significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and overall quality of your paper. Let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on any of these points.
