Okay, I've read your essay and can offer some feedback. Overall, it's a thoughtful and well-argued analysis of frames and resistance in *Pride and Prejudice*. You demonstrate a strong understanding of the novel and its social context. However, there are areas where it could be strengthened.

Here's a breakdown:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** You establish a clear thesis about the novel exploring frames and the characters' resistance to them. The thesis is presented early and revisited throughout the essay.
*   **Strong Argumentation:** The essay provides a logical progression of arguments, supported by textual evidence. You effectively use quotes to illustrate your points.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** You offer insightful interpretations of key scenes and characters, such as the picturesque scene, the descriptions of Longbourn and Pemberley, and Darcy's social behavior.
*   **Use of Secondary Source:** You incorporate Auerbach's essay to support your analysis of the Bennet household's economic and social invisibility, adding depth to your argument.
*   **Sophisticated Language:** The essay demonstrates a strong command of language and academic writing style.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Developing the Idea of "Resistance":** The essay focuses heavily on the concept of "frames" but could further develop the idea of "resistance." You mention characters pushing boundaries, but exploring *how* they actively resist and the *consequences* of that resistance would enrich the analysis. Consider:
    *   What are the specific acts of resistance Elizabeth undertakes?
    *   How does Darcy's resistance to social norms impact his reputation or relationships?
    *   What internal conflicts do the characters face as they resist these frames?
*   **Specificity in the Introduction:** While the introduction establishes the theme of frames, it could be more specific about the particular *types* of frames you will be analyzing and how those frames impact the characters' choices and development. This would give the reader a clearer roadmap for the essay.
*   **Deeper Dive into the Picturesque:** You introduce the concept of the picturesque, but you could connect it more explicitly to Austen's overall project. How does Austen's use of the picturesque *subvert* or *reinforce* the social frames she presents? Is the "irregularity" of the picturesque mirrored in the characters' unconventional behavior?
*   **Nuance and Counterarguments:** While you present a strong argument, acknowledging potential counterarguments would strengthen your analysis. For example:
    *   Are there instances where characters *choose* to remain within their frames, and if so, why?
    *   Is there a downside to resisting social expectations?
    *   Could some argue that the novel ultimately reinforces traditional social structures?
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes your points but could offer a more profound takeaway. Consider discussing the broader implications of Austen's exploration of frames and resistance. What does this reveal about her views on society, individual agency, and the possibility of social change?

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Instead of just stating that the novel examines "beauty, truth, and rationality," tie these directly to specific frames or conflicts. For instance: "Austen uses the frame of societal expectations regarding beauty to highlight the limitations placed on women's choices, challenging conventional notions of rationality and ultimately redefining what constitutes 'truth' in relationships."
*   **Picturesque Analysis:**
    *   Explore how Elizabeth embodies the "ruggedness" or "irregularity" of the picturesque. How does her wit, independence, or unconventional behavior make her a "picturesque" character in contrast to the more conventionally "smooth" characters like Caroline Bingley?
*   **Bennet Household:**
    *   While you mention the lack of description of Longbourn, consider analyzing the descriptions that *do* exist. What details are emphasized, and what do they reveal about the family's social standing and internal dynamics?
*   **Darcy's Resistance:**
    *   Explore Darcy's internal struggles as he resists his social conditioning. How does his pride conflict with his growing affection for Elizabeth? How does he overcome his initial prejudices and learn to value her intelligence and independence?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Go beyond summarizing your points and reflect on the lasting relevance of Austen's themes. Consider: "In *Pride and Prejudice*, Austen not only exposes the constraints of social frames but also suggests that true happiness lies in the courage to question and, when necessary, resist those limitations, paving the way for a more equitable and fulfilling society for both men and women."

**Revised Conclusion Example (incorporating some of these suggestions):**

> In conclusion, Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* meticulously constructs a world governed by intricate social frames â€“ of class, gender, and familial expectations. However, the novel's enduring power lies in its portrayal of characters who, in varying degrees, dare to challenge these constraints. While Darcy initially embodies the rigid confines of his aristocratic world, his eventual willingness to overcome his pride and social prejudices allows him to forge a more authentic connection with Elizabeth. Elizabeth herself, through her wit and unwavering commitment to her own values, embodies the "picturesque" irregularity that Austen champions. Though the novel ultimately affirms the importance of social harmony, it simultaneously celebrates the individual's capacity to resist unjust limitations, suggesting that true happiness is found not in blindly conforming to societal expectations, but in forging one's own path with integrity and intellectual independence. Austen's exploration thus leaves readers pondering not just the necessity of frames, but the even greater necessity of questioning them.

By addressing these points, you can elevate your essay to a more sophisticated and nuanced level of analysis. Good luck!
