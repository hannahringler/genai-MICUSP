Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper's strengths and areas for improvement, focusing on content, structure, and style.

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a clear and well-organized argument against the proposed Waterford project and offers constructive recommendations for making it more sustainable. The writer understands the concepts of smart growth and sustainable development and applies them to the specific context of the project.  The suggestions are practical and address key issues like transportation, affordable housing, and environmental impact.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Argument:** The paper clearly identifies the negative impacts of the proposed Waterford project and then systematically proposes solutions.
*   **Well-Organized:** The structure is logical and easy to follow, with clear headings and subheadings.
*   **Specific Recommendations:** The recommendations are concrete and actionable, not just vague statements. For example, suggesting a light rail system, imposing linkage fees, and setting a smart growth boundary are all specific actions.
*   **Use of Evidence:** The paper cites sources (Grengs, Hall, Roseland, Cullingworth) to support its claims, which adds credibility.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** The writer demonstrates an understanding of the local context (Salitos, King County, Yuka River) and how the project would impact the area.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The paper addresses multiple aspects of sustainability, including economic, social, and environmental factors.
*   **Visual Aid:** Inclusion of figure 1 helps readers visualize the project recommendations.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Elaboration and Depth:** While the recommendations are specific, some areas could benefit from more in-depth explanation.  For example:
    *   How exactly would the light rail system connect to Route 46?  What are the potential routes, cost estimates, or challenges?
    *   How would the "congestion charging scheme" work?  What are some examples of successful implementation elsewhere?
    *   More detail about the ecological restoration of the river. What specific actions are envisioned?
    *   Further explanation of the "impact fee" and "linkage fee." What are typical rates, legal considerations, and potential impacts on development?
*   **Counterarguments and Limitations:**
    *   Acknowledge potential counterarguments to the recommendations.  For example, developers might resist impact fees, or residents might oppose high-density development.  Addressing these concerns strengthens the argument.
    *   Discuss potential limitations of the recommendations.  For example, a light rail system might not be feasible due to cost or environmental constraints.
*   **Figure 1 Clarification:**
    *   Include a caption that explains what is being shown.
    *   Improve quality of the figure to enhance readability.

**Specific Suggestions and Edits**

Here are some sentence-level suggestions and potential edits:

*   **Introduction:** "As *a planning* advisor from Green Planning Consultants..."
*   **Transportation:** "The Waterford Project site is *in* a very inaccessible location."
*   **Transportation:** "Due to Salitos' *currently* inadequate public transportation system..."
*   **Transportation:** "The city can implement an impact fee on the development to *help* pay for a portion of a light rail system..."
*   **Affordable Housing:** "Thus, it is important for the city to impose a linkage fee onto the Waterford residential project to ensure equality among people of different socio-economic backgrounds and allow for some of the displaced residents to remain in the area. *A percentage of affordable housing units should be included in the Waterford project.*"
*   **General:** Proofread carefully for minor grammatical errors and typos.

**Overall Feedback**

This is a strong paper that demonstrates a good understanding of sustainable development principles and their application to a specific project. By adding more detail, addressing potential counterarguments, and polishing the writing, the paper can be even more persuasive and impactful.
