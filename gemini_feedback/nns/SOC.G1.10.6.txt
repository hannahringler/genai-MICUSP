Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and academic style.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of Marx's core ideas and their development across his works. The student clearly has engaged with the texts. However, the writing style is often dense, making it difficult to follow the arguments. The paper would benefit greatly from clearer phrasing, more explicit connections between ideas, and a stronger thesis statement.

**Strengths:**

*   **Knowledge of Marx:** The paper demonstrates a solid grasp of Marx's key concepts (alienation, historical materialism, critique of capitalism, etc.) and his major works.
*   **Tracing Development:** The paper attempts to trace the evolution of Marx's thought, which is a sophisticated approach.
*   **Engagement with Concepts:** The paper shows an effort to grapple with complex philosophical and sociological concepts.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarity and Thesis Statement:**

    *   **Problem:** The paper lacks a clear, concise thesis statement in the introduction. It's difficult to discern the central argument the paper intends to prove or explore.
    *   **Suggestion:** Start with a strong thesis statement that explicitly states the paper's main argument about Marx's development or a particular aspect of his work. For example: "This essay argues that Marx's intellectual development, from his early focus on alienation to his later analysis of capitalist production, reveals a shift from a humanistic critique of injustice to a more systematic and structural analysis of economic forces."
    *   **Clarity Throughout:** The sentences and paragraphs are often too dense and convoluted. Many sentences could be broken down into shorter, more manageable units.
    *   **Suggestion:** Focus on simplifying sentence structure, using active voice, and avoiding jargon when possible. Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea.

2.  **Argumentation and Structure:**

    *   **Problem:** The arguments often feel underdeveloped. The connections between Marx's ideas and the student's interpretation are not always explicitly stated.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Explicitly Connect Ideas:** Don't just summarize Marx; explain *why* his ideas are significant and *how* they relate to your thesis.
        *   **Provide Evidence:** Support your claims with specific textual evidence from Marx's writings. Quote relevant passages and explain their meaning in the context of your argument.
        *   **Develop Counterarguments (If Appropriate):** Briefly acknowledge and address potential counterarguments to strengthen your position.
        *   **Improve Paragraph Structure:** Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea. Ensure the rest of the paragraph supports and develops that idea.

3.  **Academic Style and Language:**

    *   **Problem:** The writing contains some awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, and non-idiomatic expressions.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Proofread Carefully:** Pay close attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
        *   **Use Precise Language:** Avoid vague or ambiguous terms. Define key concepts clearly.
        *   **Avoid Colloquialisms:** Maintain a formal and academic tone throughout the paper.
        *   **Sentence example:** "Marx almost has always been a realist" can be rewritten to "Marx has consistently adopted a realist perspective"

4.  **Specific Examples and Suggestions:**

    *   **"Marx almost has always been a realist..."** This sentence is awkward. Rephrase to "Marx consistently adopted a realist perspective..."
    *   **"...reality that lies beneath the appearance."** This is a good start, but elaborate on *what* that deeper reality is according to Marx.
    *   **"The force of anti-positivist to discover the underlying reality pushed Marx all the way along his theoretical maturity."** This sentence is unclear. Simplify to something like: "Marx's anti-positivist approach, which sought to uncover the underlying reality of social relations, was a driving force in his theoretical development."
    *   **"...though the master controls the slave, in return he is totally dependent on his slaves..."** Explain *why* the master is dependent. What are the implications of this dependence?
    *   **"In the On the Jewish Question and German Ideology, Marx continued to cut into the social facts that Liberalism and Utilitarian have paid enormous attention to as human nature, private and public spheres."** This sentence is difficult to understand. Break it down and clarify the connection between Marx's critique and the Liberal/Utilitarian view.

**Revised Structure Suggestion:**

Here's a possible revised structure:

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Hook (briefly introduce Marx's significance).
    *   Thesis statement (state your main argument about Marx's development).
    *   Brief overview of the paper's structure.
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   Paragraph 1: Discuss Marx's early work (e.g., *The Jewish Question*, *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*), focusing on his concept of alienation and its relation to his critique of liberalism.
    *   Paragraph 2: Analyze *The Communist Manifesto* and its focus on class struggle and the critique of private property. Explain how this builds upon his earlier work.
    *   Paragraph 3: Examine *Capital* as the culmination of Marx's thought. Discuss his analysis of capitalist production, surplus value, and the inherent contradictions of the system. Show how it differs from his earlier humanistic approach.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize your main argument.
    *   Discuss the broader implications of Marx's work and its relevance to contemporary society (optional).

**In summary,** this paper has potential, but it needs significant revisions to improve clarity, strengthen the argumentation, and refine the academic writing style. By focusing on these areas, the student can produce a much stronger and more persuasive analysis of Marx's intellectual development.
