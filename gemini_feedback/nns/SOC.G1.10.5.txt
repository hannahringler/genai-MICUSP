Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the paper, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

The paper addresses an interesting and culturally relevant topic: attitudes toward unhappy marriages in Gansu, China.  The research question is well-defined, and the paper utilizes quantitative methods (survey data and logistic regression) to explore the determinants of these attitudes. The paper demonstrates an understanding of the statistical techniques employed. However, the paper could benefit from further refinement in clarity, argumentation, and contextualization.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevant Research Question:** The topic is important and sheds light on a complex social issue within a specific cultural context. The motivation for the study is clearly stated in the introduction.
*   **Quantitative Approach:** The use of statistical analysis to identify factors influencing attitudes is a strong point.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper follows a standard research paper format (Introduction, Data & Variables, Results, Conclusion).
*   **Definition of Variables:** The section defining the variables is fairly detailed, explaining how each was coded and why it was included.
*   **Awareness of Nuance:** The author shows awareness of the complexities involved (e.g., "dual pressure" on marriage selections, different perspectives of married vs. unmarried individuals).
*   **Significant Results Identified:**  The paper identifies statistically significant relationships.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarity and Flow:**

    *   **Language:** The writing sometimes feels awkward or unclear.  This is understandable given the author's non-native English background, but it needs to be addressed through careful editing.  I recommend having a native English speaker review the paper for grammar, sentence structure, and word choice.
    *   **Transitions:** Improve transitions between paragraphs and sections to create a smoother flow of ideas. Use transition words and phrases to connect ideas logically.
    *   **Explanation of Gansu Context:** While the introduction mentions Gansu's importance, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the specific cultural, economic, and historical factors that shape attitudes toward marriage and divorce in this region. More specific details of the province itself can improve the quality of the essay.

2.  **Literature Review and Theoretical Framework:**

    *   **Missing Literature Review:** A significant weakness is the absence of a proper literature review. The paper needs to connect the research question to existing scholarship on marriage, divorce, gender roles, and social change in China. This will help to contextualize the study and demonstrate its contribution to the field. It should be its own section as well.
    *   **Theoretical Framework:**  Consider incorporating a theoretical framework to guide the analysis.  Are there relevant sociological theories (e.g., modernization theory, feminist theory, social exchange theory) that can help explain the observed relationships?
    *   **Connect to existing literature:** To make it more scholarly, you can cite literature that proves the statements you make. For example, where you say that “Family harmony and marriage maintenance have both been highly valued in Chinese society”, you can provide sources.

3.  **Results and Discussion:**

    *   **Deeper Interpretation:** The "Results" section primarily describes the statistical findings.  It needs to be expanded with more in-depth interpretation.  Why are these relationships observed? What are the potential social and cultural mechanisms at play?
    *   **Descriptive Statistics:** Table 2 states many results. Do more with this information. Provide context and a more detailed analysis.
    *   **Contradictory Findings:** The paper mentions that some regression results contradict the descriptive statistics. This discrepancy needs to be explored and explained. What could account for these differences?
    *   **Limitations:** Acknowledge the limitations of the study (e.g., cross-sectional data, specific geographic location, potential biases in survey responses).
    *   **Implications:** Discuss the broader implications of the findings. What do these results suggest about social change and evolving values in China? How might this information be used to inform social policies or interventions?

4.  **Tables:**

    *   **Include the Table Titles**.
    *   **Label variables as clearly as possible.**
    *   **Add notes to better clarify what each table presents.**

5.  **Specific Suggestions:**

    *   **Introduction:** Expand the introduction to provide more background information on the topic. Clearly state the research question and hypotheses. Provide a road map of the paper's structure.
    *   **Data and Variables:** The current "Data and Variables" section is okay, but it's more of a methods section. It's missing an explanation of why those methods are used. The data collection methods seem appropriate. However, the author can be more clear as to why those collection methods are appropriate.
    *   **Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the main findings, but it could be strengthened by reiterating the significance of the study and suggesting directions for future research.

**Revised Structure Suggestions:**

1.  **Introduction**
    *   Background and Context (Importance of the topic, cultural context of Gansu)
    *   Literature Review (Existing research on marriage, divorce, gender roles, social change in China)
    *   Theoretical Framework (If applicable)
    *   Research Question and Hypotheses
    *   Overview of the Paper
2.  **Data and Methods**
    *   Data Source and Collection (Explain the survey and sampling methods)
    *   Variables (Dependent and independent variables, coding, justification)
    *   Statistical Analysis (Explain the logistic regression model)
3.  **Results**
    *   Descriptive Statistics (Summary of the data)
    *   Regression Analysis (Present the regression results)
4.  **Discussion**
    *   Interpretation of Findings (Explain the observed relationships, address contradictory findings)
    *   Limitations of the Study
    *   Implications of the Research
5.  **Conclusion**
    *   Summary of Key Findings
    *   Significance of the Study
    *   Directions for Future Research
6.  **Appendix**
    *   Tables

**In summary, this is a solid foundation for a research paper. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly by adding a literature review, deepening the discussion of results, and improving clarity of writing, the author can significantly strengthen the paper and make a more compelling contribution to the field.**
