Okay, here's some feedback on your essay comparing Hobbes and Malthus:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Interesting Topic and Thesis:** The essay tackles a complex and thought-provoking comparison. Exploring the divergent conclusions of thinkers with similar starting assumptions is a good approach for an argumentative essay.
*   **Clear Structure:** The essay follows a logical progression, introducing the common assumptions, highlighting the differences, and then explaining the root causes of those differences.
*   **Solid Understanding of the Thinkers:** You demonstrate a grasp of the core ideas of both Hobbes and Malthus, including their views on human nature, the state of nature, and the role of government.
*   **Use of Quotations:**  You effectively use direct quotes from the thinkers to support your claims.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Specificity and Depth:** While the essay covers a lot of ground, it sometimes lacks depth.  For example, when discussing "natural law," you could delve deeper into what that specifically *meant* for Malthus in practice (e.g., specific policies he advocated). Provide concrete examples of what each philosopher actually proposed or believed the results would be. Don't just summarize their ideas.
*   **Clarity and Flow of Argument:**  The writing can be dense and sometimes unclear. Simplify the language and sentence structure to improve readability. Here are some specific points:
    *   **Overly Complex Sentences:** Many sentences contain multiple clauses and ideas, making them difficult to follow. Break them down into shorter, more manageable units.
    *   **Abstract Language:** While the subject matter is inherently abstract, strive for greater concreteness. Translate abstract concepts into more understandable terms whenever possible.
*   **Refine the Thesis:** While the thesis is present, it could be sharpened.  Instead of just saying they started with the same assumptions, specifically mention which assumptions. For example, "Despite both Hobbes and Malthus assuming a self-interested and naturally competitive human nature..." Then, make it more clear what the essay will argue caused the divergence.
*   **Grammar and Proofreading:**  The essay contains several grammatical errors (articles, verb tense agreement, etc.) and stylistic issues. Careful proofreading is essential.
*   **Analysis, not just Summary:**  Strive for more analysis of the implications of the differences between Hobbes and Malthus. What do these differences mean for our understanding of society, politics, or human nature? What are the consequences of following one line of thinking versus the other?
*   **Strengthen the Conclusion:** Make the conclusion more powerful. Summarize your main points and offer a final thought or insight. A good conclusion should leave the reader with something to consider.
*   **Citation Style:** Ensure that your citations are consistent and follow a specific academic style (e.g., MLA, Chicago).

**Specific Suggestions and Examples:**

1.  **Thesis Statement:**
    *   **Original:** "Hobbes and Malthus are both extraordinary utilitarian thinkers who started their exploration into political philosophy from the same micro-ontological assumptions..."
    *   **Revised:** "Despite both Hobbes and Malthus assuming a self-interested and naturally competitive human nature, their differing interpretations of the role and implications of natural law, influenced by their distinct historical contexts, led them to radically divergent conclusions about the optimal organization of society." (This is just an example - you may have a more precise idea of what you want to argue.)

2.  **Specificity and Examples:**
    *   **Original:** "Malthus is entirely supportive of a 'natural law' to play the key role in the organization of the society."
    *   **Revised:** "Malthus believed that natural laws, particularly population growth exceeding resource availability, should govern society.  He opposed government intervention, arguing that policies like poor laws only exacerbated the problem by encouraging population growth among the poor without increasing resources." (Now we have a concrete example of what Malthus believed).

3.  **Clarity and Sentence Structure:**
    *   **Original:** "Just as Hobbes has said, “our sociability is through an artificial covenant, not natural agreement...This covenant is that we submit to a “common-wealth” or “Leviathan” – a "Mortall God””. For Hobbes, this “Leviathan” is an absolute authority, an undivided and unlimited sovereign power, and society should exactly be beneath which through entering into the social contract; law, in this sense, should be the enforcement of contracts."
    *   **Revised:** "As Hobbes argued, sociability arises from an "artificial covenant, not natural agreement." He believed that individuals must submit to a "common-wealth" or "Leviathan"—an absolute and undivided sovereign power.  This "Leviathan" enforces the social contract, ensuring that laws are upheld."

4.  **Grammar:**
    *   **Original:** ""...of all sciences, there is none where first appearance are more deceitful than in politics."
    *   **Revised:** "...of all the sciences, there is none where first appearances are more deceitful than in politics."

**In Summary:**

Your essay has a solid foundation. By focusing on improving the clarity of your writing, adding more specific examples and analysis, and carefully proofreading, you can significantly strengthen your argument and create a more compelling and insightful piece. Good luck!
