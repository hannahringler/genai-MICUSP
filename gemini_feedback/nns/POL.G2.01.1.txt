Okay, here's some feedback on the paper you provided. I'll break it down into strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper provides a reasonable summary of Wilson's arguments in the first five chapters of "When Work Disappears." It identifies key themes like globalization, economic restructuring, and the consequences of joblessness in inner-city African American ghettos.  The attempt to visualize the complex relationships with a diagram is a good idea.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Summary:** The paper effectively summarizes Wilson's key arguments about the decline of jobs and its impact.
*   **Identifies Key Concepts:** It correctly identifies and explains concepts like globalization, economic restructuring, out-migration, and the "joblessness culture."
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, first explaining the causes of job loss and then focusing on its consequences in inner cities.
*   **Engagement with the Text:** The paper demonstrates engagement with Wilson's work by referencing specific arguments and providing supporting details.
*   **Diagram Inclusion:** While the diagram needs refinement (see below), the attempt to visualize the complex relationships between factors is commendable.
* **Identifies Policy Implications:** The conclusion effectively highlights the policy implications stemming from Wilson's analysis, such as the need for better education and job creation incentives.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper summarizes Wilson's arguments, it lacks in-depth analysis. It could benefit from a more critical evaluation of Wilson's claims, considering potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives.
*   **Diagram Clarity:** The diagram (Figure 1) is mentioned but sounds quite confusing ("so many arrows that almost any box is both a starting and an ending point"). A more focused and clearer diagram would significantly improve the paper.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** The paper would be stronger with more specific examples or data to support the claims. While it summarizes Wilson's arguments, adding real-world examples or statistics would enhance its credibility.
*   **Flow and Transitions:** The transitions between some paragraphs could be smoother. Using transition words and phrases would improve the overall flow of the paper.
*   **Grammar and Style:** There are a few instances of slightly awkward phrasing or minor grammatical errors (see specific examples below). Careful proofreading is needed.
*   **Originality:** The paper relies heavily on summarizing Wilson's arguments. It needs to demonstrate more original thought and analysis.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Develop the Analysis:**

    *   **Critical Evaluation:** Instead of simply summarizing Wilson's arguments, analyze them critically. Are there any weaknesses in his reasoning? Are there alternative explanations for the phenomena he describes?
    *   **Counterarguments:** Consider potential counterarguments to Wilson's claims. For example, are there other factors besides joblessness that contribute to the problems in inner cities?
    *   **Connect to Current Events:** Relate Wilson's arguments to current events or contemporary debates. This would demonstrate the relevance of his work and your understanding of the issues.

2.  **Improve the Diagram:**

    *   **Focus:** Identify the most crucial relationships between the factors and focus on illustrating those. Reduce the number of arrows and boxes to create a clearer and more digestible diagram.
    *   **Hierarchy:** Consider a hierarchical structure to show the relative importance of different factors. Some factors might be root causes, while others are consequences.
    *   **Clarity:** Ensure that the labels on the boxes are clear and concise.

3.  **Strengthen Supporting Evidence:**

    *   **Specific Examples:** Provide concrete examples to illustrate Wilson's arguments. For example, what specific industries have declined in inner cities? What are some examples of the "joblessness culture"?
    *   **Statistics:** Include relevant statistics to support your claims. For example, what is the unemployment rate in inner-city African American ghettos? How has it changed over time?
    *   **Additional Sources:** While the focus is on Wilson's book, incorporating information from other sources (academic articles, reports, news articles) could strengthen your analysis.

4.  **Refine Flow and Transitions:**

    *   **Transition Words:** Use transition words and phrases (e.g., "furthermore," "however," "in addition," "on the other hand") to connect ideas and create a smoother flow.
    *   **Topic Sentences:** Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea.
    *   **Logical Order:** Review the order of your paragraphs to ensure that they follow a logical progression.

5.  **Address Grammar and Style:**

    *   **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper carefully for grammatical errors, typos, and awkward phrasing.
    *   **Sentence Variety:** Vary the length and structure of your sentences to make the writing more engaging.
    *   **Conciseness:** Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases to make the writing more concise.

6.  **Enhance Originality:**

    *   **Personal Insights:** Share your own insights and perspectives on Wilson's arguments.
    *   **Synthesis:** Synthesize Wilson's ideas with other concepts or theories you have learned in your studies.
    *   **Implications:** Discuss the broader implications of Wilson's work for society and policy.

**Specific Examples (Grammar/Style):**

*   "More advanced technology continues to make processes more efficient, but at the same time displaces formally less-educated workers..."  Consider: "While advanced technology increases efficiency, it simultaneously displaces less-educated workers..."
*   "...the American economy has adapted to that in various ways." Could be more concise: "...the American economy has adapted in various ways."
*   "Jobs out of the urban perimeter are difficult to access without a car since public transportation is not always available or convenient." Consider breaking this into two sentences for better readability.

**In Summary:**

This is a good start, demonstrating a solid understanding of the source material. By deepening the analysis, clarifying the diagram, strengthening the evidence, and refining the writing, you can elevate this paper to a higher level. Focus on critical evaluation and original thought to make the paper truly your own. Good luck!
