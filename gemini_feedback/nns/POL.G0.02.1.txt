Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can offer some feedback. Here's a breakdown of my observations, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the legal concepts and principles involved in the questions posed. The student is able to apply relevant case law and constitutional provisions to analyze the issues and construct arguments. The writing is generally clear and well-organized, although some areas could benefit from more concise phrasing and stronger transitions.

**Strengths**

*   **Legal Knowledge:** The paper demonstrates a solid grasp of relevant legal principles, including strict scrutiny, equal protection, due process, res judicata, and voting rights law.
*   **Case Law Application:** The student effectively uses case law (e.g., *White*, *McPherson*, *Blackwell*, *Bush v. Gore*, *Suburban Action Coalition v. Goldman*) to support their arguments and analyze the facts.
*   **Structure and Organization:** The paper is generally well-organized, with clear headings and a logical flow of arguments.
*   **Argumentation:** The student presents reasoned arguments on both sides of the issues, demonstrating critical thinking skills.
*   **Citation:** The paper consistently cites sources, which is important for academic integrity and to support claims.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper identifies relevant legal issues and cases, some arguments could benefit from more in-depth analysis and exploration of nuances.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Some sentences and paragraphs are a bit wordy and could be made more concise and direct.
*   **Transitions:** The transitions between paragraphs and arguments could be smoother to improve the overall flow of the paper.
*   **Counterarguments and Rebuttals:** While the paper acknowledges opposing arguments, it could be strengthened by more explicit rebuttals and responses to those arguments.
*   **Synthesis:** In some sections, the paper could benefit from stronger synthesis of the case law and legal principles to create a more cohesive and persuasive argument.
*   **Proofreading:** There are a few minor grammatical and spelling errors (e.g., "Michigana") that should be corrected.

**Specific Suggestions**

**Question 1B:**

*   **"strict basis of review"**: Instead of just stating this, briefly explain *why* political speech triggers strict scrutiny (e.g., because it implicates fundamental First Amendment rights).
*   **Narrow tailoring analysis**: Elaborate more on *why* the new provision is narrowly tailored. Compare and contrast it more directly with the "announce clause" and explain why the promissory language distinction is legally significant.
*   **Scalia's argument**: Instead of simply stating what Scalia said, critically evaluate his argument. Do you agree with his distinction between "non-promissory" statements and "campaign promises"? Why or why not?

**Question 1C:**

*   **"manner"**: Spend a bit more time exploring the meaning of "manner" in Article II. Does it include the method of selection (e.g., district-based vs. at-large)?
*   **"Legislature thereof"**: Focus heavily on the phrase “Legislature thereof.” The main argument against the proposal likely hinges on the idea that "legislature" means the *state legislature* acting through the typical legislative process (i.e., bill passed by both houses and signed by the governor), not a popular vote initiative.
*   **McPherson Analysis**: Explain more clearly *why* the Court in *McPherson* concluded that determining the method of electoral selection is a question of "power and not of policy."
*   **Address Strongest Counter-Argument:** the strongest counter-argument may be the idea that a popular vote still requires legislative action to be implemented, this should be addressed if the student intends to write a good rebuttal.

**Question IIA:**

*   **Standard of Review**: The paper mentions that plaintiffs will request a strict standard of review. However, it then states that the standard of scrutiny won't matter much. This seems contradictory. Clarify why the standard of review might not be determinative in this particular case.
*   **"Dilutes the right to vote"**: Connect the argument about diluting the right to vote more explicitly to the Equal Protection Clause. Explain why disparities in voting technology might violate equal protection.
*   **Causation**: Make the connection between the "disproportionate rates of undervotes" and the voting machines even clearer.
*   **McGuffage analysis**: Discuss more thoroughly how the *McGuffage* court found that the election system resulted in discrimination based on race.

**Question IIB:**

*   **Res Judicata Elements**: the requirement of similarity should be expanded upon. Show why these facts are so similar to the previous case.
*   **Similarity of Claims**: More detail on how the claims are very similar. The paper focuses on the non-error warning technology.
*   **Privity**: Expand on this section as this may be the weakest point of the *Res Judicata* argument. Discuss if the residents are in privity with the previous party.

**General Editing/Proofreading**

*   **"Michigana"**: Should be "Michigan."
*   **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Review the paper for any awkward phrasing, run-on sentences, or grammatical errors.

**Revised Examples**

*   **Original:** "Because the new provision addresses political speech, any investigations into its constitutionality will involve a strict basis of review."
*   **Revised:** "Because the new provision restricts political speech, a form of expression that receives heightened protection under the First Amendment, any challenge to its constitutionality will be subject to strict scrutiny."

*   **Original:** "The new provision must also show that it is narrowly tailored to the aforementioned interest."
*   **Revised:** "In addition to demonstrating a compelling interest, the state must also prove that the provision is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. This requires showing that the provision is the least restrictive means of achieving the compelling interest."

**In summary:** The paper demonstrates a strong foundation in legal analysis and writing. By focusing on more in-depth analysis, clearer writing, stronger transitions, and more explicit rebuttals, the student can elevate the quality of their work and produce a more persuasive and insightful legal argument.
