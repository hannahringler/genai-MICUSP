Okay, here's some feedback on your paper "Political Realignment in the South."

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** You clearly state your thesis that the Democratic Party's shift on racial issues was a major factor in the political realignment in the South, leading white voters to leave the party, even if they didn't fully embrace Republican ideology.
*   **Strong Evidence:** You support your argument with data and research from political scientists, including studies on voter behavior, historical trends, and the impact of racial attitudes. You cite your sources appropriately.
*   **Logical Argumentation:** You build your argument in a logical and structured manner. You start with the historical context, then analyze voter behavior, and finally address counterarguments.
*   **Addresses Counterarguments:** You acknowledge and address alternative explanations for the realignment, such as overall ideological shifts, and then provide evidence to refute them.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand. You use academic language effectively.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While you argue effectively for the importance of race, consider adding more nuance. Can other factors also contribute to the realignment in a secondary way, such as religion, education, urban/rural divides, or other cultural issues? While your central argument is strong, acknowledging these factors can strengthen it further.
*   **Definition of Terms:** Define your terms earlier in the paper. For example, what do you mean by "political realignment"?  Consider defining "symbolic racism" when it is first introduced to ensure the reader understands the concept.
*   **Strength of the Evidence Regarding Independents:**  You make a good point about the significant increase in independents as a result of the realignment. However, the logical leap to the conclusion that this happened because people had trouble joining the Republican party because it didn't match their views as much as the Democrats did, that's a logical leap. While you've provided evidence to support the idea that race drove people away from the Democratic party, consider addressing other possibilities for why people became independents.
*   **"Concrete issue of race"** Consider how this phrase might read, as one reviewer might find it problematic.

**Specific Suggestions and Questions:**

*   **Introduction:** The opening sentence could be more engaging. Consider starting with a statistic about the political shift in the South or a specific example of how racial attitudes have influenced Southern politics.
*   **Emancipation Proclamation:** You mention the Emancipation Proclamation, but you could strengthen this section by explaining how it specifically impacted the South's perception of the Republican party in the decades that followed. What was the relationship between the parties and views about race during that time?
*   **Impact of Civil Rights Legislation:** You mention the Civil Rights Act and other legislation. Be more specific about how these policies affected white Southern voters' perceptions of the Democratic party. Did it make them feel alienated or betrayed?
*   **Counterarguments:** You address the idea of an overall ideological shift, but you could explore this counterargument in more depth. Were there specific economic or social policies of the Democratic party that also contributed to the shift?
*   **Conclusion:** Summarize your key findings and restate your thesis in a clear and concise manner. You could also suggest areas for future research.

**Minor Edits:**

*   "busing to achieve integration of public schools in the 1970's, and affirmative action in the 1980's, the Democrats no longer reflected the racial attitudes of the" -> "busing to achieve integration of public schools in the 1970s and affirmative action in the 1980s, the Democrats no longer reflected the racial attitudes of the"
*   "southerners had an ideological rift with the Democrats. Given this data, a more logical" -> "southerners had an ideological rift with the Democrats; given this data, a more logical"

**In summary:**

This is a well-researched and argued paper that makes a compelling case for the importance of race in the political realignment of the South. By adding more nuance, strengthening certain arguments, and addressing additional counterarguments, you can further elevate the quality of your work.
