Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on its strengths and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic of civil liberties versus national security. The author makes a strong argument, supports it with historical examples and legal references, and offers reasoned opinions. The writing is generally clear and well-organized. However, there are some areas where the argumentation could be refined and the writing made more precise.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:** The author clearly states their position that the government has, at times, overstepped its bounds in limiting civil liberties in the name of national security. The argument is consistently maintained throughout the paper.
*   **Historical Examples:** The use of Japanese internment and the Patriot Act as specific examples strengthens the argument. The author provides relevant context and details about these events.
*   **Legal References:** Citing Executive Order 9066, court cases (Korematsu v. United States, Ex Parte Merryman), and specific amendments of the Constitution adds credibility to the argument.
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, starting with a broad overview, then focusing on specific examples, and concluding with a nuanced discussion of different types of individuals/prisoners.
*   **Nuance:** The author acknowledges the importance of national security and doesn't advocate for absolute liberty at all costs. They argue for a balance and emphasize the need for due process.
*   **Critical Thinking:** The author displays critical thinking by questioning the constitutionality of certain actions and by suggesting alternative measures.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Precision:**
    *   **Vague Language:** Some sentences could be more precise. For example, "These steps are well intentionedâ€¦" is a bit vague. Elaborate on *why* they are well-intentioned.
    *   **Unclear Connections:** Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas. Sometimes the connections between examples and the main argument could be strengthened. Consider using stronger transitions.
    *   **Pronoun Clarity:** In a few instances, it's not immediately clear what a pronoun refers to.
*   **Depth of Analysis:**
    *   **Explore Counterarguments:** While the author presents a clear argument, acknowledging and refuting potential counterarguments would strengthen the analysis. For example, what are the strongest arguments in *favor* of the Patriot Act? Why do proponents believe it is necessary?
    *   **Deeper Dive into Korematsu:** The discussion of *Korematsu v. United States* could be expanded. Briefly mentioning the dissenting opinions in that case would add depth and show a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.
    *   **Guantanamo Nuances:** The section on Guantanamo is a good start, but it could be more fully developed. Discuss the legal complexities of holding detainees outside of U.S. territory and the specific rights that are (or are not) applicable.
*   **Organization and Flow:**
    *   **Paragraph Length:** Some paragraphs are quite long. Breaking them down into smaller, more focused paragraphs could improve readability.
    *   **Topic Sentences:** Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** While the introduction sets the stage, consider adding a more explicit thesis statement that clearly articulates the paper's central argument.
*   **Executive Order 9066:** Instead of just saying Japanese were denied due process, specifically explain what rights were denied.
*   **Patriot Act:**  Instead of "eradicates the personal privacy an individual has over his library, financial...", mention how the Patriot Act accomplished this. Was it through roving wiretaps, access to records without warrants, etc.?  Be specific.
*   **"Flawed response":** In the sentence, "For example, history has proven that the internment camps were a very flawed response...",  briefly state *why* they were flawed. Was it due to lack of due process, racial bias, or lack of evidence of actual threat?
*   **"Well intentioned":** Saying steps are "well intentioned" is a value judgment. Back this up or rephrase.
*   **Guantanamo Bay:** Clarify the term "Native American terrorists who bombed the Murrah Federal Building." Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were not Native Americans and were not linked to Native American terrorism. Reword to avoid ambiguity and potential misinterpretation.

**Revised Examples:**

*   **Original:** "These steps are well intentioned to maintain security, but grant too much unchecked authority to the federal government by curtailing civil rights and liberties."
*   **Revised:** "While the measures implemented after 9/11 were intended to enhance national security, the Patriot Act, in particular, granted the federal government overly broad surveillance powers without sufficient judicial oversight, potentially infringing upon the civil liberties of American citizens."

*   **Original:** "For example, history has proven that the internment camps were a very flawed response by the government..."
*   **Revised:** "History has demonstrated that the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was a deeply flawed response rooted in racial prejudice and lacking due process, as no evidence of widespread disloyalty among this population ever emerged."

**In Summary:**

This is a well-reasoned and informative paper. By addressing the areas for improvement, particularly focusing on clarity, depth of analysis, and organization, the author can elevate the paper to an even higher level. Good job!
