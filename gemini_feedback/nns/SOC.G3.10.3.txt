Okay, I've read through your paper and can offer some feedback. Overall, it's a well-structured and thoughtful piece of comparative analysis. You clearly understand the core arguments of Hobbes, Rousseau, and Spencer regarding the emergence of the supra-individual realm. Your analysis is detailed and demonstrates a good grasp of the assigned readings.  Here's a breakdown of my feedback:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Structure & Thesis:** The paper has a clear introduction that lays out your intentions, a logical progression through each author, and a concluding section that summarizes your findings.
*   **Strong Understanding of the Material:** You accurately represent the key ideas of each thinker, particularly regarding natural man, the state of nature, and the transition to society.
*   **Thoughtful Analysis:** You go beyond simply summarizing the authors' arguments and offer insightful critiques. Your questions about the logical consistency of Hobbes's model and the vagueness of Rousseau's mechanisms are particularly strong.
*   **Comparative Approach:** You effectively compare and contrast the models of the three thinkers, highlighting their similarities and differences.
*   **Clear Writing Style:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Engagement with Secondary Sources (Implicit):** While you clearly understand the primary texts, engaging with secondary sources could elevate your analysis. Secondary sources can help you understand the broader historical context of these thinkers, as well as how their ideas have been interpreted and debated by other scholars. (I understand this may not be required by the assignment)
*   **Strengthening the Concluding Section:** The concluding section could be a bit more assertive. Instead of simply restating your findings, you could offer a more definitive judgment about the overall value and limitations of these models. Which model do you find most compelling, and why? What are the broader implications of their differing approaches for understanding the relationship between the individual and society? Consider briefly suggesting the relevance or applications of these models to contemporary social issues.
*   **Specificity of Critiques:** While your critiques are insightful, sometimes they could benefit from more specific examples from the text.
*   **Clarify "Society" in Rousseau:** As you identify, Rousseau is vague on the definition of society. Consider adding that this can also be interpreted as culture and the influences from culture (which are created by the interactions of others).

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Hobbes:**
    *   In the section discussing Hobbes's natural man, you could elaborate on the role of *reason* in his model. While Hobbes emphasizes passions, he also argues that reason enables individuals to recognize the benefits of a social contract.
    *   You write "Perhaps Hobbes could have worked around this logical problem if he had developed a process for the emergence of the Common-Wealth." It would be interesting to suggest *how* Hobbes could solve this problem.
*   **Rousseau:**
    *   You identify that Rousseau "throws up his hands and declares..." While this is true, adding "and relies on time as the mechanism to allow for the change" will bring more resolution to your argument.
    *   "In Rousseau's ontological model passions “are the handiwork of society” (27). But, what makes them the providence of society?" This is a great question. You can suggest that it's the *constant interaction* between others that lead to social pressures.
    *   Consider clarifying Rousseau's concept of "amour-propre" (self-esteem dependent on the opinions of others) and how it contributes to the decline of natural man.
*   **Spencer:**
    *   When discussing Spencer, consider mentioning the potential dangers of his organic analogy. Critics have argued that it can lead to social Darwinism and justify inequalities.

**Minor Edits:**

*   "are these explanations sound" -> "are these explanations valid?"
*   "In the examination of this relationship each author proposed an ontological model within which they defined the notions of individual and supra-individual as they conceived of them." could be shortened, such as "In examining this relationship, each author proposed an ontological model, defining the notions of individual and supra-individual according to their conception of them."
*  "dose not answer" -> "does not answer"

**Revised Conclusion (Example):**

"In conclusion, while Hobbes, Rousseau, and Spencer offer compelling frameworks for understanding the relationship between the individual and society, their models ultimately fall short of providing fully satisfying explanations for the emergence of the supra-individual realm. Hobbes's model, though logically flawed, offers a powerful vision of the state as a solution to the problem of social order. Rousseau's model, while more nuanced, struggles to account for the transition from a state of nature to a social state. Spencer's organic analogy provides a useful framework for understanding social evolution, but it risks overlooking the role of power and conflict in shaping social structures. Ultimately, the enduring value of these models lies not in their scientific accuracy, but in their capacity to provoke critical reflection on the nature of human nature and the foundations of social order. While each model has its limitations, Spencer’s focus on organic development is likely the most compelling framework, though modern analysis would require incorporating external and conflict factors. As social and political concerns shift and evolve, reexamining their models is vital to modern analysis of such topics."

By incorporating these suggestions, you can further strengthen your paper and make it even more persuasive and insightful.
