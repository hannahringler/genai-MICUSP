Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and overall effectiveness.

**Overall Impression:**

This paper tackles a complex theoretical debate with ambition. It demonstrates a good grasp of the key thinkers and concepts involved (Marx, Thompson, Bourdieu, Sewell). The central argument, that some Marxist culturalists fall into a kind of determinism trap while Bourdieu escapes it, is interesting. However, the paper could benefit from greater clarity in its explanations and stronger development of some key points.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The paper clearly states its central argument in the introduction:  you're going to critically assess culturist approaches to class formation and argue that some get caught in a determinism trap, while Bourdieu provides a more successful alternative.
*   **Knowledge of Subject Matter:**  You demonstrate familiarity with the relevant theorists and their work. You cite specific works and extract key ideas.
*   **Identifies a Key Problem:** The identification of the "culturalist's dilemma" (wanting to avoid economic determinism but still implicitly relying on it) is a good insight.
*   **Focus on Comparison:** The paper effectively uses comparisons between different theorists to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Strong Conclusion**: The conclusion is effective because it briefly summarizes the key arguments made in the paper and the theoretical significance of the paper.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Explanation:**
    *   **Define Terms:** The paper uses terms like "culturist approach," "economic determinism," "seriality," and "habitus" without always fully defining them for the reader.  Even though you're writing for an academic audience, a brief working definition of these terms can help ensure everyone is on the same page.
    *   **Elaborate on Connections:** Some of the connections between different ideas could be explained more explicitly. For example, when you say Thompson's approach "underlies economic determinism," explain *how* it does so in more detail.
    *   **Provide Concrete Examples:**  Theoretical arguments are often strengthened by concrete examples.  Can you provide examples of historical events or social phenomena that illustrate how Thompson's or Rose's approach might fall into the determinism trap?
    *   **Restructure for Clarity:** Sometimes the flow of the argument feels a bit disjointed. Consider restructuring sections to create a smoother narrative.

*   **Argumentation:**
    *   **Develop Counterarguments:**  The paper primarily presents critiques of Thompson and Rose. It would be strengthened by acknowledging potential counterarguments to your critiques. For example, could someone argue that Thompson *successfully* avoids economic determinism? If so, how would you respond?
    *   **Strengthen Bourdieu Section:**  The section on Bourdieu is promising, but it could be developed further. Explain *why* his approach is so successful in avoiding the "culturalist's dilemma."  Provide more detail on his concepts of "social space," "cultural capital," and "symbolic power." How do these concepts help him overcome the limitations of other culturalist approaches?
    *   **Justify Your Focus**: Why Thompson and Rose? Make your selection explicit; there are many Marxist scholars, so your choice should be explained.
    *   **Address a Potential Issue of Equivalence:**  You mention Wright's focus on *objective* class. If this is the case, is it fair to compare Wright and Thompson, who explicitly focus on subjective class?

*   **Specific Suggestions:**

    *   **Introduction:** While the introduction is good, consider adding a sentence that briefly outlines the *structure* of the paper.
    *   **Thompson's 'Seriality':** You write that "seriality in Sartre's sense relates more to class-in-itself in Marx's distinction." Clarify how they relate.
    *   **"Social Space":** You mention Bourdieu's idea of "social space," and that "constructed classes...occupy similar positions in social spaces." This is somewhat vague. Explain how this differs from a traditional Marxist view of class structure.

**Editing Points:**

*   **Typos:** Watch out for typos and grammatical errors.
*   **Citation Style:** Ensure consistent citation style.

**Revised Structure Suggestion:**

Here's a possible restructuring of the paper:

1.  **Introduction:** State thesis, briefly define key terms, outline paper's structure.
2.  **Marx's Theory of Class:** Summarize Marx's key ideas about class (economic base, relational entity, objective/subjective dimensions).
3.  **Thompson's Approach:** Present Thompson's culturalist approach.
4.  **Critique of Thompson:**  Explain Sewell's critique and your own argument that Thompson falls into a determinism trap. Provide concrete examples. Acknowledge and respond to potential counterarguments.
5.  **Rose's Approach (and Critique):**  Same as above, but for Rose.
6.  **Bourdieu's Approach:** Explain Bourdieu's concepts of social space, cultural capital, and symbolic power. Show how these concepts allow him to overcome the limitations of Thompson and Rose.
7.  **Conclusion:** Restate thesis, summarize key arguments, and discuss the broader implications of your analysis.

By addressing these points, you can strengthen your argument, improve the clarity of your paper, and make a more convincing contribution to the debate over class formation theory. Good luck!
