Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

The paper outlines the development and testing of a 2D finite element analysis (FEA) program. It demonstrates a good understanding of FEA concepts and the steps involved in creating such a program. The inclusion of a preprocessor for mesh generation and assembly is a significant feature. The validation efforts, including the convergence study, add credibility to the work.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, starting with the program's structure, detailing the preprocessor, explaining the element stiffness matrix, and presenting validation examples.
*   **Well-Defined Preprocessor:** The description of the preprocessor and its features, such as material property assignment, mesh generation, and boundary condition application, is thorough. The step-by-step description of how to add rectangles to the structure is helpful.
*   **Validation Efforts:** The inclusion of a square plate test case and a cantilever beam convergence study is essential for demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of the program.
*   **Detailed Figures:** The figures, especially those illustrating the preprocessor's capabilities and the deformed shapes, are valuable for understanding the program's behavior.
*   **Explanation of Convergence:** The discussion of the convergence study is well-reasoned, explaining the differences in convergence speed between the FEA program and ANSYS, and highlighting the importance of shear deformation in the deep beam analysis.
*   **Consistent Format:** The paper is written consistently.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Introduction:** The paper lacks a proper introductory paragraph. The introduction should highlight the purpose of the paper, and summarize the approach undertaken.
*   **Limited Related Works:** The paper does not mention any other, similar FEA software, or the need for the software. It would be great if this information were added to the introduction.
*   **Clarity of Figures:** Some of the figures (specifically the convergence studies) could benefit from more clear labeling, axes, and descriptions.
*   **Writing and Grammar:** The paper needs significant improvement in its grammar and writing style, as highlighted in "Suggestions for Improvement."
*   **Conclusion:** The paper lacks a proper conclusion. The conclusion should summarize the results of the paper, as well as areas of further improvement.
*   **Organization:** At times, the paper could better organize its ideas for better reading flow. For example, the section on structure could be broken up.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Refine Writing and Grammar:**
    *   **Proofread Carefully:** Conduct a thorough proofreading to catch grammatical errors, typos, and inconsistencies in style. Pay attention to articles (a, an, the), subject-verb agreement, and correct tense usage.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Vary sentence structure to improve readability. Avoid overly long or complex sentences. Break them down if necessary.
    *   **Word Choice:** Use precise and appropriate vocabulary. Replace vague words with more specific terms.
    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Aim for clear and concise writing. Remove unnecessary words and phrases.
    *   **Consider Professional Editing:** If possible, have a native English speaker or a professional editor review the paper.

2.  **Improve Figures and Captions:**
    *   **Label Axes:** Ensure all graph axes are clearly labeled with appropriate units.
    *   **Descriptive Captions:** Provide detailed captions that explain the purpose and content of each figure.
    *   **Figure Quality:** Make sure figures are high-resolution and easy to understand.
    *   **Referencing:** Explicitly refer to figures in the text where they are relevant.

3.  **Expand on Limitations and Future Work:**
    *   **Acknowledge Limitations:** Discuss any limitations of the current program, such as the type of elements supported, the types of loads that can be applied, or the size of problems that can be solved.
    *   **Outline Future Directions:** Suggest potential improvements or extensions to the program, such as adding support for different element types, implementing dynamic analysis capabilities, or incorporating nonlinear material models.

4.  **Revise the Introduction:** The introduction should highlight the purpose of the paper, and summarize the approach undertaken.

5.  **Revise the Conclusion:** The conclusion should summarize the results of the paper, as well as areas of further improvement.

6.  **Add Related Works:** The paper does not mention any other, similar FEA software, or the need for the software. It would be great if this information were added to the introduction.

**Example Edits (Illustrative)**

*   **Original:** "This program was revised based on the beam-column program."
    *   **Revised:** "This program builds upon a previous beam-column analysis program by incorporating several modifications."

*   **Original:** "In this revised program, lots of effort was put on the preprocessor modification..."
    *   **Revised:** "Significant effort was devoted to enhancing the preprocessor, particularly in areas such as..."

*   **Original:** "Again, it is easier to assign the boundary conditions and nodal loads by showing the meshing result along with the nodal number aside."
    *   **Revised:** "Displaying the mesh with node numbers simplifies the application of boundary conditions and nodal loads."

By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the clarity, accuracy, and overall impact of the paper. Good luck!
