Okay, I can give you some feedback on this paper. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper tackles an interesting topic â€“ the collaborative nature of conversation. It shows a good grasp of key concepts from conversation analysis, speech act theory, and the work of researchers like Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson, Clark, and Wilkes-Gibbs. The paper demonstrates effort in summarizing and connecting these various perspectives.  However, the writing can be improved for clarity and flow. Some sections are more descriptive than analytical.

**Strengths**

*   **Strong Topic:** The central idea of conversation as a "collaborative achievement" is well-defined and relevant to linguistics.
*   **Good Knowledge Base:** You demonstrate familiarity with relevant theories (Speech Act Theory, Grice's maxims) and scholars in the field (Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson, Clark, Wilkes-Gibbs).
*   **Use of Examples:** You include examples (like the telephone call and the bar location search) to illustrate your points.
*   **Clear Structure (in principle):** The stated plan in the introduction is good (comparing CA to philosophical approaches, defining collaborative achievement).
*   **Addresses Relevant Literature:** Mentions and integrates various works well.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Clarity and Flow:** This is the biggest area for improvement. Sentences are sometimes awkwardly worded, making the argument difficult to follow. There are also issues with grammar and word choice.
*   **Analytical Depth:** While you describe different perspectives, the paper could benefit from more in-depth analysis and critical evaluation. For example, you mention the limitations of Speech Act Theory but don't fully explore the implications of these limitations.
*   **Organization and Transitions:** While the introduction outlines a plan, the paper doesn't always follow it perfectly. Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.
*   **Example Analysis:** The examples are good, but the analysis of them could be more detailed. How *specifically* do they demonstrate the collaborative nature of conversation?
*   **Proofreading:** There are several minor grammatical errors (e.g., "Nor it is," missing articles, incorrect possessives) that detract from the paper's professionalism.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Rewrite for Clarity:**
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Break down long, complex sentences into shorter, more manageable ones. Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and pronoun reference.
    *   **Word Choice:** Choose precise and appropriate words. Avoid jargon unless it's clearly defined.
    *   **Active Voice:** Use the active voice whenever possible to make your writing more direct and engaging.

2.  **Strengthen Analysis:**
    *   **Go Beyond Description:** Don't just summarize theories; analyze them. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? How do they relate to each other?
    *   **Critical Evaluation:** Offer your own insights and arguments. Do you agree with Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs that language use *only* occurs in interaction? Why or why not?
    *   **Connect to the Thesis:** Make sure every paragraph clearly supports your main argument about the collaborative nature of conversation.

3.  **Improve Organization and Transitions:**
    *   **Follow Your Outline:** Stick to the plan you outlined in the introduction.
    *   **Topic Sentences:** Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea.
    *   **Transition Words:** Use transition words and phrases (e.g., "however," "therefore," "in addition," "on the other hand") to connect ideas and create a smooth flow.

4.  **Enhance Example Analysis:**
    *   **Detailed Explanation:** Don't just present the examples; explain *exactly* how they illustrate your points.
    *   **Specific References:** Refer to specific lines or utterances within the examples to support your claims.
    *   **Consider Alternative Interpretations:** Could the examples be interpreted in different ways? Addressing potential counterarguments will strengthen your analysis.  For example, with the bar example, you could discuss how the participants are jointly constructing a memory/description, even if they don't ultimately find the name.

5.  **Proofread Carefully:**
    *   **Grammar and Spelling:** Use a grammar checker and proofread your paper carefully for errors.
    *   **Consistency:** Ensure consistent use of terminology and formatting.
    *   **Read Aloud:** Reading your paper aloud can help you identify awkward phrasing and grammatical errors.

**Example of Rewriting for Clarity (from the first paragraph):**

*   **Original:** "To treat conversation as a collaborative achievement is to open up a new perspective to the study of language. Language is not merely for referential purposes or transmission of information. Nor it is an abstract entity that can be studied regardless of its' social and interactional nature as defined in the Chomskyan dichotomy of competence and performance."

*   **Revised:** "Viewing conversation as a collaborative achievement offers a fresh perspective on the study of language. This approach moves beyond the traditional view of language as simply a tool for reference or information transmission. Furthermore, it challenges the Chomskyan idea of studying language as an abstract entity, divorced from its social and interactional context (competence vs. performance)."

**In summary:**  This paper has a solid foundation in relevant linguistic theories. By focusing on improving clarity, analysis, organization, and proofreading, you can significantly strengthen your argument and create a more compelling and persuasive piece of writing. Good luck!
