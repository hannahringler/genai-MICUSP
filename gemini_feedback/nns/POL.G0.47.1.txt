Okay, I've reviewed your paper and can provide feedback on its strengths and areas for improvement. Here's a breakdown:

**Overall Impression**

Your paper provides a detailed analysis of the "Safer, Stronger" political advertisement. You effectively identify key strategies employed by the Bush campaign and connect them to relevant concepts from political communication theory (e.g., issue ownership, incumbent style, use of symbols). Your analysis demonstrates critical thinking and a good understanding of the ad's intended effects.

**Strengths:**

*   **Detailed Description:** You provide a thorough description of the ad's content, including visuals, audio, and key messages. This allows the reader to follow your analysis closely.
*   **Theoretical Connections:** You effectively connect the ad's strategies to relevant concepts from political communication theory, such as "issue ownership," "incumbent style," the "politics of fear," and the use of the American flag as a symbol of patriotism.
*   **Critical Analysis:** You don't just describe the ad; you analyze its potential effects and limitations. You raise valid points about the potential for the ad to backfire, given the negative economic images and the association with the 9/11 tragedy.
*   **Sound Argumentation:** You support your claims with evidence from the ad itself and from scholarly sources (West, Iyengar & McGrady, Mark).
*   **Insightful Observations:** You offer several insightful observations, such as your point about the potentially problematic use of the word "change" in an ad emphasizing the incumbent's leadership.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper has a logical flow, starting with a general description of the ad and then moving into a more detailed analysis of specific strategies and their potential effects.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** While the paper is detailed, some sentences and paragraphs could be more concise and clearly worded. There are instances where the language is a bit convoluted, which makes it harder to follow your line of reasoning.
*   **Sentence Structure & Grammar:** There are some instances of awkward sentence structure and grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect verb tenses). Careful proofreading is essential.
*   **Strengthen the Counterarguments:** Acknowledge counterarguments and explore why those arguments are wrong.
*   **Develop the "Ethically Suspect" Point:** You mention that you couldn't find anything "ethically suspect" in the ad's editing or production techniques. Consider exploring this point further. Even if you don't find blatant manipulation, discuss the ethical implications of using images of 9/11 or emphasizing fear in a political campaign.
*   **Offer a Stronger Conclusion:** While your conclusion summarizes your main points, it could be more impactful. Offer a final assessment of the ad's overall effectiveness and its contribution to the political landscape.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Example 1 (Clarity):**
    *   **Original:** "At the first time viewing the spot, I could not clearly figure out whether it was a candidate-positive ad or a negative attack ad put out by his opponents, even though I had found the ad from the Republican side of the 2004 presidential contest."
    *   **Revised:** "Upon initial viewing, I was unsure whether the ad was a positive campaign message or a negative attack, even though I knew it originated from the Republican side of the 2004 presidential race."
*   **Example 2 (Sentence Structure):**
    *   **Original:** "With all the sounds muted, as I had suspected, this spot almost seemed as a negative ad against the incumbent"
    *   **Revised:** "With the sound muted, the ad seemed like an attack on the incumbent, confirming my initial suspicion."
*   **Example 3 (Grammar):**
    *   **Original:** "...incumbent style of campaigning, he appealed to the people to support the "steady leadership.""
    *   **Revised:** "...incumbent style of campaigning, he appealed to the people to support his "steady leadership.""
*   **Improve the conclusion:**
    *   Instead of just restating your arguments, try ending with a broader statement about the impact of political advertising and the importance of critical analysis.

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Proofread Carefully:** Read your paper aloud to identify awkward sentences and grammatical errors.
2.  **Refine Language:** Look for opportunities to make your writing more concise and precise.
3.  **Develop Conclusion:** Strengthen your conclusion by offering a final evaluation of the ad's effectiveness and its broader implications.

By addressing these areas, you can further enhance the clarity, persuasiveness, and overall impact of your paper. It's a well-researched and insightful analysis, and with a few revisions, it can be even stronger.
