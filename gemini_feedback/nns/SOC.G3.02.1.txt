Okay, I've reviewed the paper and here's a breakdown of my feedback, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

This is a well-structured and thoughtful paper that demonstrates a good understanding of Hobbes, Durkheim, and Spencer's theories on the emergence of the supra-individual realm. The paper successfully compares and contrasts their perspectives, identifies key arguments, and raises critical questions about their limitations. The historical context provided for Hobbes is particularly helpful.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Structure and Thesis:** The paper has a clear introduction, body paragraphs focused on each theorist, and a conclusion. The thesis is well-defined in the introduction.
*   **Good Understanding of the Theories:** You demonstrate a solid grasp of the core ideas of each theorist. You accurately summarize their arguments and provide relevant quotes to support your interpretations.
*   **Effective Comparison and Contrast:** The paper effectively compares and contrasts the different perspectives, highlighting both similarities and differences.
*   **Critical Analysis:** You don't just summarize; you offer critical analysis of each theory, pointing out potential weaknesses and limitations. The questions you raise about Durkheim's theory, for example, are insightful.
*   **Historical Context:** Providing the historical context for Hobbes' work helps the reader understand the motivations behind his theory.
*   **Clear Writing:** The writing is generally clear and easy to follow, even when discussing complex concepts.
*   **Proper Citations:** The paper consistently cites sources, which adds credibility and avoids plagiarism. The bibliography is well-formatted.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper provides a good overview, some sections could benefit from more in-depth analysis. For example, you could explore the implications of each theory in more detail or consider alternative interpretations.
*   **Counterarguments:** While you offer critiques, consider explicitly addressing potential counterarguments to your critiques. This would strengthen your analysis and demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the theories.
*   **Connection to Contemporary Issues:** While the paper focuses on historical theorists, you could strengthen the conclusion by briefly connecting their ideas to contemporary social and political issues. This would make the paper more relevant and engaging for the reader.
*   **Clarity Regarding "Supra-individual Realm":** While you define the term, you could consider providing more concrete examples of what constitutes this realm in contemporary society.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Consider expanding the introduction to provide a more detailed overview of the paper's structure and key arguments. You could also briefly introduce the historical context for each theorist.
*   **Hobbes Section:**
    *   In the section on Hobbes, you could elaborate on the "state of nature" and its implications for social order.
    *   The footnote about "common-wealth" is a good point. You could weave that idea more directly into your analysis of Hobbes's intentions.
    *   Address "How people move from war state to establishment of common wealth" more completely, as it is a large claim to not explain
*   **Spencer Section:**
    *   In comparing Spencer to Hobbes, you could elaborate on the different assumptions they make about human nature and the role of the state.
    *   Clarify Spencer's concept of "social evolution" and its implications for social progress. What does he mean by "higher types of society?"
    *   Expand your critique of Spencer's biological reasoning. Provide specific examples of how his analogies might be flawed or misleading.
*   **Durkheim Section:**
    *   Elaborate on Durkheim's concept of "collective consciousness" and its relationship to the state.
    *   Explore the potential dangers of a strong state, as envisioned by Durkheim. Could it lead to authoritarianism or the suppression of individual rights?
    *   Address the critiques of Durkheim, which are well-done. How do they influence him, or his ideas?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   The conclusion could be strengthened by summarizing the key similarities and differences between the three theorists.
    *   Consider briefly connecting their ideas to contemporary social and political issues, such as the role of government in regulating the economy or protecting individual rights.

**Minor Edits:**

*   Page 1: "Hobbes was one of the forerunners who pondered..." (Consider rephrasing to be more concise, e.g., "Hobbes was an early thinker who explored...")
*   Page 2: "Hobbes's argument gives us a useful framework..." (Change "Hobbes's" to "Hobbes' argument provides a useful framework")
*   Page 3: "Spencer's theory of social evolution is meaningful in that he tries to develop some of the principles based on which society works and evolves." (Reword for clarity, e.g., "Spencer's theory of social evolution is significant because he attempts to develop principles to explain how societies function and evolve.")
*   Page 4: "the State presuppose their existence; it exists only where they exist” (45)." should read "the State presupposes their existence; it exists only where they exist” (45)."
*   Page 5: Correct "tread on" to "trample on" when stating that states "tread on individual rights".

**Overall Grade:**

Based on the strengths and areas for improvement, I would give this paper a grade in the range of **B+ to A-**. With some revisions to deepen the analysis, address counterarguments, and connect the theories to contemporary issues, it could easily reach the A level.

I hope this feedback is helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.
