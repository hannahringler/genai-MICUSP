Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can provide feedback focusing on areas like clarity, structure, experimental design, data interpretation, and overall presentation.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents an interesting investigation into the role of NMDA receptors in fear conditioning. The introduction provides adequate background information. The paper could benefit from clearer explanations, tighter organization, and more robust statistical analysis. The discussion section is also a bit speculative and could be strengthened by connecting the findings more directly to the existing literature and by avoiding overly broad generalizations.

**Specific Feedback:**

**1. Introduction:**

*   **Clarity:** The introduction is generally well-written but could be more focused.
*   **Scope:** The introduction is wide in scope and introduces some elements that may not be as necessary, such as skydiving.
*   **Specificity:** The last sentences of the introduction need to be made more specific, since "cellular mechanisms" and "new memories" are very wide topics.

**2. Methods:**

*   **Subjects:** "Forty-Eight (two subjects per group) male Long- Evans (hooded) rats were used." Should say how many groups there were in total.
*   **Procedure:** Be more precise about the timing of events. For example, how long was the interval between surgery and pre-training? Was there a habituation period to the handling before surgery?
*   **Drug Infusion:** Include the concentration of the drug infused.
*   **Procedure (General):** Were the researchers blind to the treatment conditions when scoring the behaviors? This is crucial to minimize bias.
*   **Time Sampling:** Explain why a 10-second interval was chosen for the time-sampling procedure. Was this based on previous literature or pilot studies?

**3. Results:**

*   **Presentation:** The results are presented clearly and include descriptive statistics.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** The paper lacks any statistical analysis. It is essential to perform statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests) to determine if the observed differences between groups are statistically significant. Without statistical analysis, the conclusions are merely suggestive.

**4. Figures:**

*   **Clarity:** The figures are generally clear.
*   **Error Bars:** Error bars (e.g., standard error of the mean) should be included in the figures to provide a visual representation of the variability within each group.

**5. Discussion:**

*   **Speculation:** Be careful to avoid over-speculation.
*   **Alternative Explanations:** Acknowledge limitations of the study and discuss potential alternative explanations for the findings. For instance, could stress from the surgery or handling have influenced the rats' behavior?
*   **Future Directions:** Expand upon the future directions mentioned.

**6. General Comments:**

*   **Writing Style:** The writing style is generally good but could be more concise and precise. Avoid using overly complex language or jargon.
*   **Grammar/Typos:** Proofread the paper carefully to correct any grammatical errors or typos.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Briefly mention that the experimental procedures were approved by an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) or equivalent.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1.  **Statistical Analysis:** Perform appropriate statistical tests to analyze the data and determine the significance of the findings.
2.  **Address Limitations:** Acknowledge the limitations of the study and discuss potential alternative explanations for the findings.
3.  **Strengthen Discussion:** Connect the findings more directly to the existing literature and avoid overly broad generalizations.
4.  **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper carefully to correct any grammatical errors or typos.

By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the quality and impact of your paper. Let me know if you have any other questions.
