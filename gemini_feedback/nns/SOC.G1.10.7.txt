Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering its strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the theorists discussed and attempts to synthesize their ideas around the theme of structure and agency. The categorization of theorists is a useful approach. However, the writing is dense, and the arguments could be made more clear and concise. The paper also needs to be edited carefully for grammatical errors and clarity.

**Strengths**

*   **Theoretical Grasp:** The author seems to have a solid grasp of the core concepts of Durkheim, Saussure, Alexander, Bourdieu, and Foucault.
*   **Organization:** The attempt to group the theorists is a good organizational strategy.
*   **Engagement with Key Concepts:** The paper engages with key concepts like structural determinism, agency, habitus, field, discourse, and power.
*   **Critical Thinking:** The author attempts to critically analyze the theorists and identify their limitations.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The writing is often dense and difficult to follow. Sentences are often long and complex, obscuring the main point. This makes it harder for the reader to grasp the author's arguments.
*   **Grammar and Style:** There are several grammatical errors and stylistic issues that distract from the content.
*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper identifies some key differences between the theorists, it could benefit from more in-depth analysis and critical evaluation. The connections between the theorists in each group could be stronger.
*   **Evidence and Examples:** The paper relies heavily on abstract theoretical concepts. Providing more concrete examples to illustrate these concepts would make the arguments more accessible and persuasive.
*   **Transition:** The paper needs smoother transitions between paragraphs and ideas.
*   **Lack of Strong Thesis Statement:** Although the paper states that it will be grouping the theorists, it lacks a strong thesis statement that clearly articulates the overall argument or purpose. This makes it difficult for the reader to understand the main point of the paper.
*   **Uneven Focus:** Foucault is given relatively more attention than the other theorists. The analysis of the other theorists could be expanded to match the depth of the Foucault discussion.

**Specific Suggestions**

1.  **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   **Simplify Sentence Structure:** Break down long sentences into shorter, more manageable ones.
    *   **Use Active Voice:** Prefer active voice over passive voice to make the writing more direct and clear.
    *   **Define Terms:** Explicitly define key terms when they are first introduced. Even if the reader knows the terms, stating the paper's understanding of the terms will improve the paper's clarity.
    *   **Provide Transitions:** Use transition words and phrases (e.g., "however," "in addition," "therefore," "similarly") to connect ideas and guide the reader through the argument.

2.  **Grammar and Style:**
    *   **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper thoroughly to correct grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors.
    *   **Vary Sentence Structure:** Use a variety of sentence structures to make the writing more engaging.
    *   **Avoid Jargon:** Use clear and precise language, avoiding unnecessary jargon. If you must use jargon, define it.
    *   **Consider using Grammarly or similar software:** This can help identify grammatical issues.

3.  **Depth of Analysis:**
    *   **Strengthen the Connections within Groups:** Explain more explicitly why the theorists in each group belong together. What are the shared assumptions or limitations?
    *   **Critique the Theorists:** Go beyond simply summarizing the theorists' ideas. Evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and consider how their work has been challenged or revised by other scholars.
    *   **Elaborate:** When discussing concepts or arguments, unpack the layers of meaning and show why these concepts are important.

4.  **Evidence and Examples:**
    *   **Provide Concrete Examples:** Illustrate abstract theoretical concepts with concrete examples from real-world phenomena or specific research studies.
    *   **Use Quotations Selectively:** Use quotations sparingly and only when they are essential to support your argument. Always explain the significance of the quotation.

5.  **Thesis Statement:**
    *   **Develop a Clear Thesis:** Develop a clear and concise thesis statement that articulates the main argument of the paper. The thesis statement should be placed in the introduction and should guide the reader through the rest of the paper. The thesis should also be reflected in the conclusion.

6.  **Focus and Balance:**
    *   **Ensure Even Focus:** Make sure that each theorist receives adequate attention and that the analysis is balanced across all the theorists.

**Example of Rewriting a Paragraph**

**Original:**

"The second group will be called: Structural Internalism. This theme indicates that although the social actors have the room to take actions under the structure, however, they are unconscious of the structure dominating over them since the structure is already internalized into their actions. So the agency will not substantially take effect. Within this group are Alexander and Bourdieu. For Alexander, he criticized Habermas of analyzing communication in a too rationalized way while ignoring the dark side â€“ normative side of the communicative process. So in his narratives although the social actors communicate with and share the emotional identification with each other, the process of communication is playing the main role, rather than the social actors themselves."

**Revised:**

"The second group is categorized as *Structural Internalism*. This concept suggests that while social actors possess some agency, they are often unaware of how deeply the structure influences their actions because the structure is internalized. This limits the extent to which agency can lead to substantial change. This group includes Alexander and Bourdieu. Alexander, for example, criticized Habermas's overly rational view of communication. Alexander argued that Habermas ignored the normative, 'dark side' of communication. While social actors may communicate and share emotional identification, Alexander ultimately saw the *process* of communication as the dominant force, rather than the conscious choices of the actors themselves."

**In summary,** this paper has potential, but it needs significant revision to improve clarity, conciseness, and depth of analysis. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above, the author can create a more compelling and persuasive argument.
