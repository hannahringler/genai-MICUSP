Here's some feedback on the paper "Hire Me, You Know You Want To":

**Overall Impressions**

*   **Engaging and Relatable:** The essay starts strong with a relatable and humorous depiction of the stress and absurdity of the career fair experience. It's easy to connect with the author's feelings of anxiety and the "performance" aspect of job hunting.
*   **Voice and Style:** The author has a distinct, engaging voice. The writing is generally clear and conversational, though there are areas for improvement (see below). The use of anecdotes and personal experiences makes the essay more interesting.
*   **Content:** The essay provides a mix of practical advice and personal reflections on the job search. The practical advice is helpful, and the personal reflections add depth and authenticity.
*   **Structure:** The essay could benefit from a more clearly defined structure. The transitions between different aspects of the career fair experience (e.g., the initial shock, the preparation, the actual interview) could be smoother.

**Specific Areas for Improvement**

1.  **Clarity and Precision:**
    *   Some sentences are a bit convoluted or wordy, making them harder to follow. Aim for concise and direct language.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "Desperation and depression syndromes are not uncommon among engineering students in the months following because of the impact career fair leaves behind." (Can be simplified)
        *   "After they face the reality of the market and decide that they are not in any hurry or any competent position in finding an internship or a full-time job..." (Needs to be more direct)

2.  **Grammar and Mechanics:**
    *   There are some instances of grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "Once I heard a story where the candidate was flown to New York for an interview, and then afterwards was given a tour around the city..." (Fix "afterwards")
        *   "This kind of things happen all the time, it's a survival of the fittest." (Fix "this kind of things")
        *   Proofread carefully to catch these errors.

3.  **Organization and Transitions:**
    *   The essay jumps between different aspects of the career fair experience without always providing clear transitions.
    *   **Suggestions:**
        *   Use transition words or phrases to connect ideas (e.g., "In addition," "However," "Furthermore," "For example").
        *   Consider using topic sentences to introduce the main idea of each paragraph.
        *   Think about grouping related ideas together to create a more coherent flow.

4.  **Strengthen Conclusions:**
    *   Each section and the overall conclusion could be stronger.
    *   **Example:**
        *   The ending is a little abrupt. A more reflective and insightful conclusion could leave a stronger impression. Consider summarizing key takeaways or offering a final thought on the nature of job hunting and "fitting in".

**Positive Aspects**

*   **Authenticity:** The essay feels genuine and honest, which is appealing to readers.
*   **Humor:** The author's use of humor helps to lighten the mood and make the essay more engaging.
*   **Practical Advice:** The essay offers valuable advice on preparing for career fairs and interviews.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:** The opening is good. Make sure that the essay's central claim (finding a job is about performing as much as capability) is clear.
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   Use more specific examples from the author's experiences to illustrate the points being made.
    *   Provide context for anecdotes. This can help the reader understand why they are relevant to the overall message.
    *   Elaborate on the advice provided. Explain *why* the advice is helpful, not just *what* it is.
*   **Conclusion:** Instead of a simple recap, offer some closing thoughts.

**Overall**

This is a promising essay with a unique voice and valuable insights. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, you can significantly strengthen the clarity, coherence, and impact of your writing.
