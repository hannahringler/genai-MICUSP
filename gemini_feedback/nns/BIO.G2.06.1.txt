Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the provided miniproposal, covering its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

The miniproposal tackles an interesting and significant question in developmental biology. It's generally well-organized, presenting a clear hypothesis, specific aims, and rationales. The background information provides context and justification for the proposed experiments. However, it can be improved by adding more specifics on experiment design and better clarity on experimental endpoints and analysis.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Hypothesis:** The central hypothesis (Sox7 acts with Oct4 to induce endoderm differentiation in mice early embryonic development) is clearly stated and testable.
*   **Logical Structure:** The proposal follows a logical flow, starting with background, moving to preliminary data, and then outlining specific aims.
*   **Specific Aims:** Each aim addresses a specific aspect of the hypothesis, and the related rationale section is clear. The aims progress logically, starting with examining the roles of Oct4 and Sox7 together and then moving into mechanistic investigation.
*   **Relevance and Significance:** The work builds on existing literature (zebrafish Spg/Cas system) and addresses a fundamental question in early development. The stated therapeutic implication provides significance.
*   **Good Literature Citations:** The cited literature is relevant and supports the claims made in the introduction and rationales.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Lack of Specificity in Experimental Design:** This is the most significant weakness.  The proposal often describes general techniques but lacks specific details on *how* these techniques will be applied, *what* will be measured, and *how* the data will be analyzed.
    *   **Example:** For the siRNA knockdown experiments (Aim 1a), state the specific siRNAs that will be used, the concentration, the method of transfection, the time points for analysis after knockdown, and how gene expression will be quantified (e.g., using what specific primers for qPCR).
    *   **Example:** For the chimera experiments (Aim 1a), specify the number of embryos that will be injected, the stage of blastocyst development, and how the resulting chimeras will be analyzed (e.g., by immunostaining for specific markers, examining tissue contribution, and quantifying CFP expression). How many animals will be analyzed?
    *   **Example:** For the GST-pull down assay and EMSA (Aim 2a), include buffer composition, salt concentrations, and detailed procedure on how the proteins will be handled.
2.  **Vague Experimental Endpoints:** The proposal needs to clearly define what constitutes a positive or negative result for each experiment.  What specific changes in expression levels, protein interactions, or cellular phenotypes will be considered significant?
    *   **Example:** In Aim 1a, what percentage reduction in Sox17:CFP expression will be considered a significant effect of Oct4 knockdown? What fold increase in sox17:GFP reporter gene expression will be considered an effect for Sox7 transgenic cells with Nodal Induction?
3.  **Controls:** Include more detail about the controls used in each experiment. "Empty vector transfected cells will serve as control" is not enough. What specific controls will be used for qPCR, Western blotting, immunostaining, ChIP, and luciferase assays? Consider positive and negative controls.
4.  **Anticipated Results and Potential Problems:** This section is good, but it can be expanded.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Add potential troubleshooting steps for anticipated problems.  For example, "If the purified protein cannot cause the mobility shift, it is possible that the binding requires other partners. To test this, we will add ES cell lysates and see if it helps in the mobility shift." is a good starting point, but what if this doesn't work? Have alternative approaches considered.
    *   **Alternative Interpretations:** Consider alternative interpretations of the results and how these interpretations would be addressed.
5.  **Statistical Analysis:** The proposal lacks any mention of statistical analysis.  How will the data be analyzed statistically to determine if the observed differences are significant? What statistical tests will be used (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA)? How many replicates will be performed for each experiment to ensure sufficient statistical power?
6.  **Clarity and Precision:** While generally well-written, some sentences are a bit convoluted and could be clearer.
    *   **Example:** "Whether there exits a functional cas homolog in mice that acts with Oct4 to induce endoderm differentiation awaits investigation."  Could be rephrased as: "Whether a functional Cas homolog exists in mice and interacts with Oct4 to induce endoderm differentiation remains unknown."

**Specific Comments on Aims**

*   **Aim 1a:** Good rationale. Needs much more specific experimental details on the knockdown experiments and the chimera experiments (as mentioned above).
*   **Aim 1b:** Needs more detail on how the Tetracycline inducible system will be controlled and validated. How will you ensure the correct level of Sox7 expression?
*   **Aim 2a:** The GST-pull down and EMSA assays are good starting points, but need more specifics. How will you confirm the specificity of the Oct4 and Sox7 antibodies? What specific DNA sequences containing Octamer and Sox elements will be used in the EMSA?
*   **Aim 2b:** What is the rationale for testing if Oct4 and Sox7 repress each other? It would be nice to see some preliminary evidence for this.

**Revised Examples**

Here are a couple of examples of how to improve the specificity of the experimental design:

*   **Original:** "To test if transient Oct4 upregulation is required for endoderm differentiation, siRNA or antisense cDNA mediated Oct4 knockdown will be performed in Nodal induced ES cells expressing nkx2.5 promoter:GFP and sox17 promoter:CFP."

*   **Revised:** "To test if transient Oct4 upregulation is required for endoderm differentiation, we will transfect Nodal-induced ES cells expressing nkx2.5 promoter:GFP and sox17 promoter:CFP with 50 nM of Oct4-specific siRNA (sequence: [insert sequence here]) or a control scrambled siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Knockdown efficiency will be assessed by qPCR using the following primers: [insert primer sequences here] at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-transfection.  Cells will then be analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify GFP and CFP expression.  We will use [specific antibody and protocol] to measure Oct4 expression. The percentage of GFP+ and CFP+ cells will be compared between the Oct4 siRNA-treated and control siRNA-treated cells using a t-test. We will also assess the expression of other endoderm markers such as [list markers] by qPCR."

*   **Original:** "Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using Oct4 and Sox7 antibody in ES cells 48hr after Nodal treatment will be performed to see if they co-occupy the endoderm specific gene promoter such as sox17."

*   **Revised:** "Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays will be performed on ES cells 48 hours after Nodal treatment using antibodies against Oct4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9008) and Sox7 (R&D Systems, AF2635).  Briefly, cells will be crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde, lysed, and sonicated to generate DNA fragments of 200-1000 bp.  The lysates will be immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4Â°C.  DNA will be eluted, purified, and analyzed by qPCR using primers specific for the sox17 promoter region ([insert primer sequences here]) and a control region [insert control region]. Enrichment will be calculated as the percentage of input DNA immunoprecipitated with each antibody.  We will also perform ChIP-qPCR for other known endoderm-specific gene promoters.  As a negative control, we will perform ChIP using an IgG antibody."

**In summary:** The miniproposal has a strong foundation. By adding more specific details on experimental design, clearly defining experimental endpoints, and addressing potential problems and alternative interpretations, you can significantly strengthen the proposal and increase its chances of success. Good luck!
