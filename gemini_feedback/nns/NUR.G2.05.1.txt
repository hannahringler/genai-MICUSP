Okay, I can provide feedback on the paper based on the OCR text you provided.  Since I can't assess the *actual* writing quality (flow, voice, etc.) without the original document, I'll focus on what I *can* evaluate:

**Overall Impression Based on the Text:**

*   **Solid Start:** The introduction clearly outlines the problem (adolescent risky sexual behavior, low condom use), its significance, and the proposed solution (using the Theory of Planned Behavior - TPB).
*   **Good Use of Statistics:** The paper effectively uses statistics to highlight the severity of the issue.
*   **Literature Review Needs Strengthening:** The literature review section is adequate, but has some problems noted below.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper appears to be logically organized, presenting the problem, the theory, existing research, and potential applications.
*   **Conclusion Needs More Impact:** The conclusion is a little weak; it needs to strongly emphasize the potential of the TPB and outline concrete steps for future research or intervention.

**Specific Feedback & Suggestions:**

**1. Introduction & Problem Statement:**

*   **Strong:** Clearly establishes the need for intervention.
*   **Suggestion:** Slightly expand on the "potentially deadly sexually transmitted infections" to specifically mention some of the more serious ones (e.g., HIV, syphilis, HPV and its link to cervical cancer). This would add weight to the argument.

**2. Condom Use in the Adolescent Population:**

*   **Strong:** Good use of statistics from reputable sources (CDC, HHS).
*   **Suggestion:** Consider adding a sentence or two that address potential counterarguments (e.g., why some adolescents *don't* use condoms despite knowing the risks). Common reasons include:
    *   Lack of access/availability
    *   Embarrassment
    *   Belief that they are not at risk
    *   Spontaneity and unpreparedness
    *   Influence of alcohol/drugs
    *   Partner objection

**3. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB):**

*   **Good:**  Provides a decent explanation of the TPB and its underlying assumptions.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Visual Aid (Already Included):**  The paper already notes an appendix with a conceptual map. This is excellent. Make sure the map is clear and accurately represents the TPB's constructs and their relationships.
    *   **Operationalize the Concepts:** Give concrete examples of how "attitude," "subjective norms," and "perceived behavioral control" *specifically* relate to condom use.  For example:
        *   **Attitude:**  "An adolescent with a positive attitude towards condoms might believe they are effective in preventing STIs and pregnancy and that they don't significantly reduce sexual pleasure."
        *   **Subjective Norms:** "If an adolescent believes that their friends and romantic partners expect them to use condoms, they are more likely to do so."
        *   **Perceived Behavioral Control:**  "An adolescent who feels they can easily obtain condoms, know how to use them correctly, and can confidently negotiate condom use with a partner has high perceived behavioral control."
    *   **Criticisms of TPB:** Briefly address potential criticisms of the TPB. Some criticisms include:
        *   It may overemphasize rational, conscious decision-making and neglect the role of emotions or habits.
        *   The intention-behavior gap:  People's intentions don't always translate into actual behavior.
        *   It doesn't fully account for environmental or social factors that might limit a person's ability to act on their intentions.

**4. Literature Review:**

*   **Needs Improvement:**  While the studies mentioned are relevant, the review is somewhat limited.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   **Broaden the Scope:**  Look for more studies that specifically apply the TPB to *adolescent* condom use.
    *   **Critical Analysis:**  Don't just summarize the studies. Critically evaluate their strengths and weaknesses:
        *   **Sample Size & Demographics:**  Are the samples representative of the target population?  (Mentioning issues with a study focusing on a STI clinic is good.)
        *   **Methodology:**  Were the methods rigorous?  Were the measures reliable and valid?  What type of statistical analysis was performed?
        *   **Limitations:**  What are the acknowledged limitations of the study?
        *   **Generalizability:**  How generalizable are the findings to other populations or settings?
    *   **Gaps in the Literature:** Clearly identify the gaps in the literature that your paper is addressing. What questions remain unanswered? What needs to be investigated further?  The paper does an okay job of this, but be more explicit.
    *   **Synthesis:**  Look for common themes or conflicting findings across the studies. What overall conclusions can you draw from the existing research?

**5. Current Public Knowledge:**

*   **Potentially Weak:** The connection between this section and the TPB needs to be clearer.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   **Link to TPB:**  Explicitly connect the examples of public knowledge (e.g., "talk to your kids" campaigns, Title X) to the TPB constructs. How do these efforts influence adolescents' attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived behavioral control related to condom use?
    *   **Evidence:** Support claims about public knowledge with evidence (e.g., data on the reach and impact of the "talk to your kids" campaigns).
    *   **Critique:**  Are current public knowledge efforts effective?  Where do they fall short?  How could they be improved by applying the TPB?

**6. Future Potential of Theory of Planned Behavior:**

*   **Good, But Needs to Be More Specific:** This section has potential to make a strong impact.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   **Concrete Recommendations:** Outline specific, actionable recommendations for how the TPB could be used to develop more effective interventions:
        *   **Tailored Interventions:** Emphasize the need for interventions that are tailored to specific adolescent populations (e.g., based on gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status).
        *   **Addressing Barriers:**  Identify specific barriers to condom use (e.g., lack of access, embarrassment, negative perceptions) and how interventions could address these barriers.
        *   **Promoting Positive Norms:**  Discuss how interventions could promote positive social norms around condom use (e.g., by engaging peer leaders, using social media campaigns).
        *   **Enhancing Skills:**  Suggest interventions that enhance adolescents' skills in obtaining condoms, using them correctly, and negotiating condom use with partners.
    *   **Future Research:**  Suggest specific research questions that need to be addressed:
        *   "What are the key beliefs that influence adolescents' attitudes towards condoms?"
        *   "What are the social norms surrounding condom use in different adolescent communities?"
        *   "What interventions are most effective in increasing perceived behavioral control over condom use?"
    *   **Measurable Outcomes:**  State the measurable outcomes that would indicate success (e.g., increased condom use rates, reduced STI rates, decreased unintended pregnancies).

**7. References:**

*   **Good:** You have a solid list of references, which shows you consulted relevant literature.
*   **Suggestion:** Make sure all citations in the text are accurate and consistent with the reference list.

**Additional Tips:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Strive for clarity and conciseness in your writing. Avoid jargon or overly technical language.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread your paper carefully for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and typos.
*   **Consider Your Audience:** Keep your target audience in mind as you write. Are you writing for other researchers, healthcare professionals, or a general audience? Adjust your language and level of detail accordingly.

By addressing these points, you can significantly strengthen your paper and make a more compelling argument for the use of the Theory of Planned Behavior in promoting adolescent condom use. Good luck!
