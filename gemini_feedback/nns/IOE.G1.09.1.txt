Okay, I'll provide feedback on the paper based on the OCR text you provided.  I'll focus on aspects like clarity, organization, technical language, and potential areas for improvement.  Keep in mind that without seeing the actual formatting (beyond the OCR conversion), some of my comments might be limited.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper addresses a relevant problem in supply chain management: inventory sharing to reduce shipping costs. It lays out the problem, assumptions, and proposed solutions (stochastic and LP models).  However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved to enhance clarity, rigor, and impact.

**Specific Feedback:**

*   **Abstract/Executive Summary (Missing):**  A significant omission is a concise abstract or executive summary at the beginning. This is crucial for giving the reader an immediate overview of the problem, approach, key findings, and recommendations. *Essential addition.*
*   **Introduction (Improved but could do with tightening):** The introduction is good in establishing the problem, solution and methodology, but it could be more compelling.
*   **Problem Description:**
    *   It's clear but could benefit from a sentence quantifying the current shipping costs or the potential savings. This would strengthen the problem's importance.
    *   The phrase "contact sequence rules" is used repeatedly. While understandable, consider varying the language to avoid repetition (e.g., "ordering policies," "response protocols").

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The assumptions are clearly stated and important for understanding the model's limitations.
    *   Justification for assumption 2 (no seasonality) is relegated to the appendix (6.1). While the appendix contains the proof, a brief sentence summarizing the evidence *in the main text* would be helpful. "Analysis of historical demand data (Appendix 6.1) showed no statistically significant seasonal patterns."
    *   Consider the potential impact of violated assumptions. Briefly discuss the limitations and what could happen if assumptions aren't valid.

*   **Parameter Calculation:**
    *   This section is very concise.  It defines the variables S and X but doesn't explain *how* these parameters are calculated or estimated in practice. This is a crucial step in making the model usable. A reference to Appendix 6.2 helps, but more detail may be needed in the main text to explain the data sources and calculation methods.

*   **Stochastic and LP Models (Section 4):**
    *   This is the core of the paper, but it needs more depth.
    *   **Model Description (4.1.1):** Model assumption 1 could be restructured. For example: "Each dealer will request emergency orders only from one dealer within its pool or from the DC. Inter-dealer orders will only occur if a pool member has sufficient excess inventory."
    *  The justification given for the fixed costs associated with emergency orders is too long.
    *   **Pooling Configurations (4.1.1.2):** This section presents the key idea of distance-based pooling.
        *   The description of how the pools were formed is a bit convoluted. Use simpler, more direct language.
        *   The logic behind excluding the 5 dealers closest to the DC is sound but could be strengthened by mentioning the percentage of demand these dealers represent. "These 5 dealers, representing X% of total demand, were excluded from pooling due to their proximity to the DC..."
        *   The explanation of DEE (Distance and Expectation of Excess) is unclear in the main text. Relying on Appendix 6.5 is not sufficient.
    *   **Contact Sequencing Rules (4.1.1.3):** These are clearly explained.
    *   **Shipping Costs (4.1.2):** Present these results in a table for easier comparison. Mention the units involved.
*   **Transportation Problem Model (4.2):**
    *   This section is too brief.
    *   Mention the specific software used (LINGO).
    *   The justification for using linear programming is appropriate. However, provide a *brief* (one-sentence) description of how the model is formulated: "The LP model minimizes total shipping cost subject to constraints on supply, demand, and inventory levels."
    *   A sample objective function and constraints are in the Appendix, but the description here doesn't provide any insight into *what* is being optimized or *how* the constraints work.
*   **Result Analysis and Recommendations (Section 5):**
    *   This section is where you interpret the results and provide actionable recommendations. The conclusion that distance-based pooling with the closest-first rule (CFR) is best needs stronger support.
    *   Quantify the cost savings: "The DB & CFR plan resulted in an estimated X% reduction in total shipping costs compared to the no-sharing plan, representing a savings of $Y per year."
    *   Discuss the sensitivity of the results to changes in demand patterns or shipping costs.  Are the recommendations robust?
    *   Acknowledge limitations and suggest future research directions.

**General Style and Clarity:**

*   **Technical Jargon:** The paper uses some technical terms (e.g., "stochastic model," "LP model," "periodic review") without sufficient explanation for a general audience. While readers in the field of IOE may understand these, ensure that someone with a general business background could follow the main ideas.
*   **Grammar and Proofreading:** The OCR process may have introduced errors, so meticulously proofread the final version.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Add Abstract/Executive Summary:** Essential.
2.  **Expand the Model Description:** Explain the core equations and logic of the stochastic and LP models in more detail.
3.  **Quantify Results:** Always present numerical results with units and in a way that highlights the benefits of the proposed solution.
4.  **Strengthen the Recommendations:** Provide a more thorough justification for your recommendations, considering potential limitations and sensitivities.
5.  **Improve Clarity:** Simplify language and provide more context for technical terms.
6.  **Tables and Figures:** Use tables and figures to present data and results in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.
7.  **Appendix Reference:** Make sure the appendices contain all the information that is not essential but is required for reproducing your results.

By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of your paper. Good luck!
