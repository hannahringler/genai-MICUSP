Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper. Here's a breakdown of my assessment, covering strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a critical analysis of the FTC's approval of the Boeing/Lockheed Martin joint venture (ULA). It's clear that the author has read the relevant documents and has formed a strong opinion, arguing that the merger is harmful to competition and that the Wall Street Journal's reporting is inadequate. The paper demonstrates a good understanding of antitrust concepts and the rule of reason.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The paper clearly states its main argument: the FTC's approval of the ULA joint venture is problematic, and the WSJ's reporting is misleading.
*   **Solid Research:** The paper cites a variety of primary sources, including FTC documents, government reports, and news articles. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issue.
*   **Logical Argumentation:** The author presents a logical argument, outlining the potential harms to competition, questioning the DoD's assessment of the benefits, and highlighting the weaknesses in the FTC's consent order.
*   **Critical Analysis:** The paper goes beyond simply summarizing the facts; it offers a critical analysis of the FTC's decision and the WSJ's reporting. The author identifies potential conflicts of interest and questions the motivations of the parties involved.
*   **Understanding of Relevant Concepts:** The author clearly understands concepts such as horizontal and vertical concerns, price and non-price competition, rule of reason, etc.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Tone and Objectivity:** The tone is sometimes argumentative and potentially biased. The author frequently uses strong language (e.g., "lame acknowledgement of ignorance," "spendthrift ways," "irresponsible policymaking") that might detract from the perceived objectivity of the analysis. While critical analysis is valuable, it's important to maintain a professional and balanced tone.
*   **Depth of Economic Analysis:** While the paper identifies potential harms to competition, it could benefit from a more in-depth economic analysis.
*   **Overreliance on Assertions:** While the author backs up claims with sources, there are times where a claim is made without sufficient explanation or justification. For instance: *"The DoD's spendthrift ways and private interests may be being perpetuated at public cost..."* needs more support.
*   **Limited Discussion of Counterarguments:** While the paper acknowledges the DoD's argument for the merger, it does not fully engage with potential counterarguments.
*   **Organization:** While the argument is mostly logical, it could be more clearly structured.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Tone and Objectivity:**

    *   **Temper the Language:** Review the paper and identify instances where the language is overly strong or judgmental. Replace these phrases with more neutral and objective language. Instead of saying "lame acknowledgement of ignorance," consider something like "The commissioner's statement indicates a lack of expertise in assessing the technical aspects of the merger."
    *   **Acknowledge Nuance:** Recognise and express possible nuances and complexities in the arguments that you are critiquing.
2.  **Deeper Economic Analysis:**

    *   **Elaborate on Harms to Competition:** Provide more specific examples of how the ULA joint venture could harm competition in the launch services and space vehicle markets. For example, how could ULA leverage its monopoly power to raise prices, reduce innovation, or discriminate against competitors?
    *   **Discuss Potential Efficiencies:** Acknowledge and discuss any potential efficiencies that could result from the merger, such as economies of scale or improved coordination. Then, explain why these efficiencies are not sufficient to outweigh the potential harms to competition.
3.  **Strengthen Assertions with Evidence and Explanation:**

    *   **Support Claims with Data:** Whenever possible, back up your claims with data or evidence.
    *   **Provide More Context:** Offer additional context or background information to support your arguments. For example, when discussing the DoD's spending habits, provide specific examples of wasteful spending or mismanagement.

4.  **Address Counterarguments:**

    *   **Identify Counterarguments:** Think about the arguments that could be made in favor of the merger.
    *   **Evaluate Counterarguments:** Carefully consider the merits of these counterarguments and explain why they are ultimately unpersuasive.

5.  **Organization and Clarity:**

    *   **Outline:** Consider using a more structured outline to organize your thoughts and ensure that your argument flows logically.
    *   **Transitions:** Use clear and concise transitions to connect your ideas and guide the reader through your analysis.

**Specific Examples of Improvements:**

*   **Original:** "The DoD's spendthrift ways and private interests may be being perpetuated at public cost..."
    *   **Revised:** "Reports by the Government Accountability Office have documented instances of cost overruns and inefficient spending within the DoD (cite GAO report). This raises concerns that the DoD's assessment of the ULA merger may not fully account for the potential costs to taxpayers."

*   **Original:** "This seems like a good point of which the media might inform the public."
    *   **Revised:** "Given these concerns, there is a need for greater public awareness of the potential implications of the ULA merger."

**In Summary:**

The paper has a strong foundation in research and argumentation. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above, the author can produce an even more persuasive and impactful analysis. Specifically, focusing on strengthening the objectivity of your work will go a long way.
