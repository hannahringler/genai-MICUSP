Okay, I've reviewed the research protocol. Here's some feedback, focusing on aspects that could be improved for clarity, rigor, and ethical considerations.

**Overall Impressions:**

*   The protocol is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of qualitative research methods, particularly content analysis.
*   It's clear the researcher has thought through many of the logistical and ethical challenges of conducting research in Pakistan.
*   The writing is generally clear but could benefit from some tightening and more concise phrasing.
*   The extensive inclusion of appendices is a positive sign, though they aren't explicitly included here.

**Specific Feedback:**

**1. Introduction and Research Questions:**

*   The purpose statement is clear. However, consider rewording slightly for increased impact. For example: "This study aims to understand the lived experiences of Pakistani women in managing their recurrent depression, focusing on the specific strategies they employ, the factors influencing their choices, and their perceptions of the effectiveness of these strategies."
*   Be sure the introduction and literature review clearly establish the **need** for this research. What gaps in knowledge exist about Pakistani women and depression? Why is this study important for this specific population?
*   Ensure that your research questions are aligned to your research design. Are they descriptive enough for a qual design?

**2. Research Design:**

*   The explanation of content analysis is good. It's important to emphasize that the *approach* to content analysis (inductive, deductive, or mixed) needs to be chosen and justified.
*   What is the theoretical framework guiding your study? Mentioning this would strengthen the design, for example, a cultural safety or intersectionality framework.
*   Ensure that the chosen theoretical framework is appropriately reflected in the research questions and how it is guiding the coding.

**3. Sample:**

*   The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally well-defined.
*   However, the rationale for the age cutoff (18 years) could be strengthened.
*   Clarify **how** bipolar disorder and substance abuse will be validated besides self-report and medical records. What specific questions will be asked to elicit this information? Consider cultural factors that may impact self-reporting.
*   "Purposeful sampling" is mentioned, but the specific *type* of purposeful sampling (e.g., maximum variation, typical case, snowball) should be identified and justified.
*   The rationale for the sample size (12-15) needs more support. While saturation is mentioned, *how* will you *know* when saturation is reached? What specific criteria will you use?

**4. Measures (Interview Guide):**

*   It is good that the interview guide is tailored to the research questions, but make sure that the guide is reviewed and piloted so you can assess face validity.
*   The decision to use open-ended questions is appropriate.
*   The process of evaluating the interview questions with non-depressed Pakistani women is crucial. Be specific about *how* their feedback will be incorporated into the final interview guide. What changes are anticipated based on their feedback?
*   Consider a question to determine if there were any medical emergencies.
*   It is important to pilot test the interview guide before data collection. Are these the right questions and what are the areas that can be improved?
*   Describe how the interview questions relate to the research questions.

**5. Procedure:**

*   The process for obtaining ethical approvals and gaining access to the research site is clearly outlined.
*   The recruitment methods are well-considered. It's excellent that you're addressing potential literacy issues.
*   Be specific about how you will address the power dynamic between clinicians and potential participants. Will the clinician be present when the investigator speaks with potential candidates? If so, how will you ensure potential participant autonomy?
*   Describe the role of a translator and steps you will take to ensure data security and confidentiality.

**6. Human Subject Protection:**

*   The informed consent process is thorough.
*   It's critical to address the potential for emotional distress during the interviews. What specific support resources (e.g., contact information for mental health services) will be provided to participants?
*   The plan for addressing suicidal ideation is well-defined.
*   The measures to maintain confidentiality are good.
*   Include steps to ensure privacy and safety when conducting research.
*   Be sure to specify what happens to the data and consent forms after the study.

**7. Minority/Gender/Children:**

*   The justification for focusing on women is clear.
*   Consider adding a statement about cultural sensitivity. How will the researcher's own biases and assumptions be managed to ensure respectful and accurate data collection and interpretation?

**8. Data Analysis:**

*   The plan for transcribing and translating the interviews is appropriate.
*   The process of "checking the translated version" needs more detail. How will you ensure accuracy and equivalence of meaning across languages? Will you use back-translation?
*   Indicate what type of analysis is expected and how to implement.
*   How will you ensure the trustworthiness of the data?

**9. Appendix:**

*   Include appendix for any recruitment material.
*   Ensure that a signed copy of the ethical approval is provided.

**10. General:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Review the protocol for opportunities to simplify language and reduce wordiness.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure consistent terminology throughout the document.
*   **References:** Double-check all references for accuracy and adherence to a specific citation style.

By addressing these points, you can significantly strengthen your research protocol and increase the likelihood of a successful and ethically sound study. Remember that a well-written protocol is the foundation for high-quality research. Good luck!
