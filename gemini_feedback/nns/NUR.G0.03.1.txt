Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the paper, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a clear argument for comprehensive contraceptive coverage, grounding it in rights, social justice, and gender equality. It highlights the disparities in coverage, the biases within the healthcare system, and the economic and social consequences of limited access. The paper demonstrates research and an understanding of the topic.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The central argument is clear: women should have comprehensive contraceptive coverage due to rights, gender equality, and social justice.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper generally follows a logical structure, moving from a statement of rights to specific examples of disparities and then to potential solutions.
*   **Use of Evidence:** The paper relies on research and sources to support its claims. The inclusion of statistics, studies, and legal examples strengthens the argument.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The paper effectively raises ethical questions about fairness, access, and the impact of limiting reproductive choices.
*   **Awareness of Social Context:** The paper demonstrates an understanding of how class, gender, and historical biases influence access to contraception.
*   **Bibliography:** The inclusion of a "Works Cited" page demonstrates adherence to academic standards.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Sentence Structure and Clarity:** There are instances where the sentences are lengthy, and could be broken down for better readability.
*   **Deepen Analysis:** While the paper presents evidence, there are areas where the analysis could be deepened.
*   **Counterarguments:** While the paper is persuasive, acknowledging and refuting potential counterarguments would make it stronger.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Strengthen Thesis Statement:** Ensure the thesis statement is strong, specific, and directly answers the prompt or question. The current introduction is a bit broad.
2.  **Refine Argumentation:**

    *   **Develop Analysis Further:** Instead of just presenting evidence, analyze its implications more deeply. For instance, when discussing the history of sterilization abuse, explain *how* this history directly relates to current attitudes toward contraceptive coverage.
    *   **Address Counterarguments:** Acknowledge potential counterarguments:
        *   E.g., "Some argue that employers should not be forced to provide contraceptive coverage due to religious objections." Then, provide a clear and compelling refutation.
        *   "Some may argue that contraception is not essential healthcare." Refute this by highlighting its preventative benefits.
    *   **Sharpen Logical Flow:**  Make transitions between paragraphs more seamless. Use transition words or phrases to clarify the relationship between ideas.

3.  **Address Clarity and Style:**

    *   **Sentence Structure:** Be mindful of sentence length. Shorter, more concise sentences can improve readability.
    *   **Vary Sentence Structure:** Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences to make the writing more engaging.
    *   **Clarity of Language:** Avoid jargon.
    *   **Proofread Carefully:** Before submitting, carefully proofread for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.

4.  **Works Cited:**

    *   **Formatting Consistency:** Make sure your citations are consistently formatted according to your chosen style guide (APA, MLA, etc.).

**Example Improvements**

*   **Original:** "However the inconsistency in coverage of contraceptives by health insurance providers in the United States leaves many women without the means to effectively utilize contraceptives and in this way places limits on women in terms of reproductive control."
*   **Revised:** "However, inconsistent contraceptive coverage by U.S. health insurance providers restricts women's access and limits their reproductive control."

**In Summary**

The paper has a solid foundation and demonstrates good understanding of the topic. By refining the argumentation, improving clarity, addressing counterarguments, and meticulously editing, you can elevate it to a higher level. Good luck!
