Okay, here's feedback on the paper "Reviewing 'On Sense and Reference'," focusing on clarity, argumentation, and academic writing style.

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of Frege's "On Sense and Reference" and engages critically with Frege's arguments.  The author raises valid questions about Frege's concepts and identifies potential inconsistencies in his analysis. However, the writing sometimes lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the arguments. The paper also reads at times more like a set of reactions and observations, and less like a systematically structured argument.

**Strengths**

*   **Understanding of Frege:** The author clearly grasps the core concepts of sense, reference, and the distinction between them.
*   **Critical Engagement:** The paper doesn't just summarize Frege's work; it questions his assumptions and identifies potential weaknesses.  The questions raised about the reference of sentences and subordinate clauses are particularly insightful.
*   **Specific Examples:** The author uses examples from Frege's paper to support their points, which helps to ground the critique in the text.
*   **Original Thinking:** The paper doesn't just repeat common criticisms of Frege; it offers original insights and perspectives. The idea of skipping the idea of the “reference” of a sentence is particularly interesting.

**Areas for Improvement**

1.  **Clarity and Structure:**
    *   **Organization:** The paper would benefit from a clearer organizational structure.  Consider explicitly stating the central argument or thesis at the beginning of the paper. Divide it into more clearly defined sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of Frege's work or a particular criticism.
    *   **Transitions:** Improve transitions between paragraphs and ideas.  Use transitional phrases (e.g., "Furthermore," "However," "In contrast") to guide the reader through the logical flow of your argument.
    *   **Conciseness:** Some sentences are too long and convoluted.  Break them down into shorter, simpler sentences for better readability.
    *   **Definitions:**  Since the paper depends on understanding key terms, ensure that your usage aligns clearly with how you explain them. For example, clarify how "reference" is being used and challenged in different contexts.

2.  **Argumentation:**
    *   **Develop Arguments More Fully:** While the paper raises interesting questions, it sometimes lacks in-depth development of the arguments.  Provide more evidence and reasoning to support your claims.
    *   **Address Counterarguments:** Anticipate and address potential counterarguments to your criticisms. This will strengthen your position and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the issues.
    *   **Support Claims with Evidence:** While you provide examples, make sure each claim is explicitly linked to evidence from Frege's text or other sources.

3.  **Academic Writing Style:**
    *   **Formality:**  Maintain a consistent level of formality throughout the paper.  Avoid overly informal language or colloquialisms.
    *   **Objectivity:**  While critical engagement is important, maintain a tone of objectivity. Avoid making statements that are overly subjective or based on personal opinion without sufficient justification.
    *   **Proofreading:** Carefully proofread the paper for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and typos. There are a few in the OCR.

4.  **Specific Comments**

    *   **Page 1:** the end of the introduction appears to promise that inclarification is responsible for problems regarding the reference of sentences, but the inclarification of terms appears more to be regarding the reference of words.

    *   **Page 2:** Why is it strange that Frege skips discussing verbs/adjectives? Is this an omission that weakens his argument?

    *   **Page 3:** The last paragraph reads as almost a rhetorical question, and could benefit from expanding on the core argument or claims.

    *   **Page 4:** The tree diagram is helpful, but consider explaining the relationships it illustrates more explicitly in the text.

    *   **Page 5:** The discussion of Frege's analysis in Situation 2 needs clarification. Explain more clearly why you think Frege's analysis is contradictory.

    *   **Page 6:** The paper states "If we follow Frege's proposal that truth values comes from the judgement of the thought, we will see making effort on this topic is going a bit far away." It is unclear why this proposal makes this effort go a bit far away.

    *   **Page 7:** The discussion of Bebel's example is confusing. Explain more clearly what Frege is trying to demonstrate with this example and why you disagree with his interpretation.

**Suggestions for Revision**

1.  **Outline:** Create a detailed outline of the paper before you begin writing or revising. This will help you to organize your thoughts and ensure that your argument flows logically.
2.  **Topic Sentences:** Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that states the main idea of the paragraph.
3.  **Evidence:** Provide specific evidence from Frege's text or other sources to support your claims.
4.  **Counterarguments:** Address potential counterarguments to your criticisms.
5.  **Clarity:** Reread the paper carefully, paying attention to clarity and conciseness. Revise sentences that are too long or convoluted.
6.  **Proofreading:** Proofread the paper carefully for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and typos.

By addressing these areas for improvement, you can significantly strengthen your paper and make it a more compelling and insightful analysis of Frege's "On Sense and Reference." Good luck!
