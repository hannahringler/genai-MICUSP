Okay, I can give you some feedback on this paper based on the OCR text you've provided.  Keep in mind that I'm only seeing the text and not the formatting, which can sometimes influence the overall impression.

**Overall Impression:**

This appears to be a well-researched and sophisticated piece of literary analysis. The argument is complex and engages with a wide range of primary and secondary sources. The author is clearly knowledgeable about Shakespeare, early modern humoral theory, and related critical debates. The essay shows signs of strong critical thinking and the ability to synthesize diverse perspectives into a coherent argument. However, due to the OCR text format, it is difficult to fully assess clarity, structure, and specific stylistic choices without the original document.

**Strengths:**

*   **Original Argument:** The essay develops a specific and compelling argument about the role of sight and the construction of selfhood in *Troilus and Cressida*, connecting this to early modern humoral theory and theories of spectacle. It argues that the play, to a degree, subverts masculine visions of constructing identity in favor of inner integrity that resists external observation.
*   **Strong Evidence & Close Reading:** The analysis is grounded in close readings of specific passages from *Troilus and Cressida*, Ficino, du Laurens, and other relevant texts. The author demonstrates a good ability to interpret textual details and connect them to broader theoretical frameworks.
*   **Engagement with Scholarship:** The essay effectively integrates a range of critical voices (Paster, Charnes, Roach, Girard, Greene, Yachnin, Crosbie, Hillman) to support and refine its argument.
*   **Historical Context:** The essay situates *Troilus and Cressida* within its historical context, drawing on early modern theories of the body, sight, and performance.
*   **Meta-theatrical Awareness:** The analysis of the play's meta-theatrical elements adds another layer of complexity and insight to the interpretation.

**Potential Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Structure:** While the argument seems complex, some sentences and paragraphs sound dense. Ensure each paragraph has a clear focus, and transitions effectively connect one idea to the next. Consider ways to simplify sentence structure without sacrificing nuance.

*   **Define key terms early:** Concepts such as "humoral body," "subjectivity," and "interiority" might be clarified explicitly earlier in the essay to guide the reader. While the essay demonstrates understanding, providing clear definitions upfront can enhance accessibility.

*   **Address counter-arguments more explicitly:** The essay acknowledges some limitations (e.g., Charnes' argument), but it could benefit from a more robust engagement with alternative interpretations. Consider addressing potential objections to your argument more directly.

*   **Refine Concluding Remarks:** The conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly summarizing the main points of the argument and highlighting the broader implications of your analysis. What is the lasting importance or significance of your interpretation of *Troilus and Cressida*?

**Specific Comments (Based on OCR Text):**

*   **Page 1:** The opening could be slightly more engaging. Start with the *Troilus and Cressida* question and build your argument from there.
*   **Page 2:** The distinction between "identity" and "subjectivity" as per Charnes could be further elucidated. Consider briefly illustrating the problematic nature of this distinction.
*   **Page 3-4:** The overview of Ficino and du Laurens is well-handled, but ensure that the connections to Shakespeare are always kept in the reader's mind.
*   **Page 6:** The discussion of Ulysses and Achilles is strong.
*   **Page 7-8:** The analysis of Cressida's character is insightful, but consider if the phrase "gendered critique of personation" is the best descriptor.
*   **Page 9:** A more comprehensive breakdown of Thersites' critique will reinforce his role as a voice of realism.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Review and Revise:** Carefully review the essay for clarity, coherence, and stylistic polish.
2.  **Seek Feedback:** Share the essay with a trusted reader (e.g., professor, writing center tutor) and ask for specific feedback on the clarity of your argument and the effectiveness of your writing.
3.  **Proofread:** Thoroughly proofread the essay for any errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

Overall, this is a promising piece of work. With some careful revision and attention to detail, you can further strengthen the clarity and impact of your argument.
