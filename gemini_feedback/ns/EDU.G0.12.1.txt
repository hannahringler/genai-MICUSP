Here's some feedback on the paper, covering various aspects:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Descriptive:** The paper provides a clear and detailed description of Abbott Middle School, covering demographics, academics, facilities, and culture.  A reader unfamiliar with the school would get a good sense of what it's like.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure, starting with demographics and moving to facilities, culture, and academic approaches.  This makes it easy to follow.
*   **Uses Specific Examples:** The paper includes specific examples to support its points (e.g., statistics on student ethnicity and proficiency, descriptions of school facilities, and mention of specific programs).
*   **Connects to Theoretical Frameworks:** The paper attempts to connect observations to theoretical frameworks (e.g., Delpit, Anyon), which adds depth and analytical rigor.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Analysis and Argumentation:** While the paper is descriptive, it could benefit from stronger analysis and argumentation. The paper seems to offer observations and inferences.
*   **Developing the Theoretical Connections:** The connections to Delpit and Anyon are a good start but could be developed further. For instance:
    *   **Delpit:**  Instead of just stating "the culture may be of racism without racists," elaborate on *how* this manifests in the classroom. Provide specific examples of teacher-student interactions or curricular choices that might perpetuate inequity.  How are student voices valued (or not)?
    *   **Anyon:** Explain in more detail how Abbott's emphasis on skills and questioning aligns with Anyon's description of affluent professional schools. Are there elements of Abbott that *don't* fit Anyon's model?
*   **Nuance and Complexity:** Avoid generalizations and strive for nuance. For example, the statement that the school *may* have a silent culture of power is too vague. It is better to provide evidence and allow the reader to see for themselves.
*   **Focus and Thesis:** Having a clear thesis statement early on could strengthen the paper. What is the central argument or point you are trying to make about Abbott Middle School? Is it a positive assessment?  A critique? A more balanced view? A clear thesis will guide the selection of evidence and the direction of your analysis.
*   **Objectivity and Subjectivity:** The paper is generally objective, but there are moments where personal opinions might unintentionally influence the writing. It is better to observe and interpret.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Demographics Section:** It might be helpful to compare Abbott's demographics to regional or national averages to provide context.  Is Abbott more or less diverse than other schools in the area?
*   **Facilities Section:** While describing the facilities, consider their purpose.  Does the availability of technology actually translate to effective use in the classroom?
*   **Culture Section:**  The statement that students separate themselves by gender needs further exploration. Why do they do this? What are the social dynamics at play? Is this separation problematic?
*   **Word Choice:** Replace "a big of a part" with "a big part."

**Revised Structure to Consider:**

1.  **Introduction (with Thesis):** State your main argument about Abbott Middle School.
2.  **Demographics and Context:** Provide the demographic information and contextualize it within the region.
3.  **Physical Environment and Resources:** Describe the facilities and resources and their impact on learning.
4.  **Academic Culture and Practices:** Discuss the curriculum, teaching methods, and academic expectations, connecting to Anyon.
5.  **Social Culture and Equity:** Analyze the social dynamics, addressing issues of race, gender, and social class, connecting to Delpit.
6.  **Conclusion:** Summarize your argument and offer a final assessment of Abbott Middle School.

By focusing on analysis, developing the theoretical connections, and refining the overall argument, you can elevate this paper from a descriptive overview to a more insightful and compelling analysis of Abbott Middle School.
