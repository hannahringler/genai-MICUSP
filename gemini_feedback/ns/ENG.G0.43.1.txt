Okay, I've reviewed your paper on Margery Kempe's self-fashioning. Here's a breakdown of feedback, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The paper is well-written, demonstrating a strong understanding of Margery Kempe's *Book* and its critical interpretations. Your argument, that Margery Kempe uses visions to fashion a specific role and gain agency, is interesting and well-supported with textual evidence. The writing is generally clear and sophisticated. The paper's strength lies in its close reading of the text and its ability to draw insightful connections between Kempe's narrative strategies and her social context.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Argument:** You establish your thesis early and maintain focus throughout the paper. The argument that Margery Kempe uses her visions to self-fashion and gain agency is compelling.
*   **Strong Evidence:** You provide ample textual evidence from *The Book of Margery Kempe* to support your claims. You effectively integrate quotes and analyze them to demonstrate your point.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** You demonstrate a good understanding of the social and religious context in which Kempe lived, showing how her actions were both unusual and strategic.
*   **Sophisticated Analysis:** You go beyond simply summarizing the text and offer insightful interpretations of Kempe's motivations and narrative techniques. Your analysis of her self-referential style ("the creature") and her manipulation of chronology is particularly strong.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper has a logical structure, with each paragraph building upon the previous one to advance your argument.
*   **Effective Use of Secondary Sources:** You use secondary sources (Brundage, Noonan) effectively to support your points and provide additional context.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Nuance in Argument:** While the paper makes a strong case for Kempe's agency, it sometimes leans towards portraying her as entirely calculated in her self-fashioning. Adding a bit more nuance by acknowledging the potential for genuine religious experience or psychological complexity could strengthen the argument.
*   **Addressing Counterarguments:** While you acknowledge the potential for genuine religious experience briefly, consider dedicating a small section to explicitly addressing potential counterarguments more fully. For example, some might argue that Kempe was mentally unstable and not in control of her actions, or that her visions were purely a product of her social conditioning.
*   **Exploring Implications:** In the conclusion, consider briefly exploring the broader implications of your analysis. What does Kempe's story tell us about women's roles in the Middle Ages, the nature of religious experience, or the power of narrative?

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Consider adding a "roadmap" sentence to the end of your introduction to specifically state the points you plan to present in the paper.

*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   **Paragraph 2 (p.1):** The last sentence " to engage with the world as an active participant" is a little vague. Consider re-phrasing to "that she needs to gain authority in the male-dominated relgious arena."
    *   **Page 3, Footnote 3:** I believe her avoidance of artistic self-aggrandizement was borne of genuine reverence for God's creation. In this paper, though, I wish to make the point that her actual motives are not relevant: only the beneficial end-products of her choices." Consider removing the first part "I believe her avoidance of artistic self-aggrandizement was borne of genuine reverence for God's creation" as it weakens your arguments.
    *   **Page 6:** In discussion about Margery's marriage, consider stating that sex in marriage was viewed as a duty. This will add more depth to the reasons she refused.

*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Expand the conclusion to more thoroughly discuss the broader implications of your findings, which I mentioned above.

**Revised Excerpt Example (Adding Nuance)**

Here's an example of how you might revise a sentence to add nuance:

*   **Original:** "This image, however, is self-consciously crafted."
*   **Revised:** "While there is undoubtedly a performative aspect to this image, the extent to which it was consciously crafted remains open to interpretation. However, regardless of the level of conscious intent, Margery narrates..."

**Overall Grade Estimation**

Based on the strengths and areas for improvement, this paper would likely receive a grade in the **A- to A range**. Addressing the suggestions above could potentially raise it to an A.

I hope this feedback is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
