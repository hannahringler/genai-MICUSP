Okay, I've read through the paper and here's my feedback, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis and Argument:** The paper presents a clear and compelling argument about the significant influence of Edmund Spenser on W.B. Yeats, extending beyond mere imitation to a deeper engagement with Spenser's ideas about poetry, politics, and the nature of reality.
*   **In-Depth Analysis:** The paper demonstrates a deep understanding of both Yeats and Spenser, drawing on a wide range of their works (poems, essays, plays, etc.) to support its claims.  The analysis is insightful and nuanced, avoiding simplistic comparisons.
*   **Solid Research and Evidence:** The paper is well-researched, drawing on a variety of critical sources to support its interpretations. The use of quotations from both primary and secondary sources is effective.
*   **Clear Structure and Organization:** The paper is logically organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that develop specific aspects of the argument, and a conclusion that synthesizes the main points. The section headings are informative and helpful.
*   **Engaging Writing Style:** The writing is generally clear, sophisticated, and engaging, making the complex arguments accessible to the reader.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Specificity in Linking Quotes to Argument:** While the paper uses many quotes, some connections between the quotes and the argument could be strengthened.  Sometimes the quotes feel illustrative rather than argumentative. More on this below.
*   **Nuance and Counterarguments:** While the paper convincingly argues for Spenser's influence, acknowledging and addressing potential counterarguments could further strengthen the analysis. For instance, could other poets also have been influences on Yeats?
*   **Clarity on Specific Theoretical Frameworks:** While the paper touches on various theoretical concepts (allegory vs. symbolism, Romanticism, Modernism, Post-colonialism), explicitly stating the theoretical frameworks you're using could add depth to the analysis.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   The opening quote is good but make sure to connect it more directly to the essay's thesis.
    *   The last sentence of the introduction is great at laying out the essay's scope.

*   **Body Paragraphs (General):**
    *   **Topic Sentences:** Ensure that each paragraph's topic sentence clearly states the main point and its connection to the overall thesis.
    *   **Quote Integration:**
        *   Instead of just dropping quotes in, focus on the *work* being done by the quote in the argument.
        *   After each quote, explicitly explain how it supports your claim and what specific aspects of the quote are most relevant.  Don't assume the reader will make the same connections you do.
        *   Consider using shorter, more impactful quotes and weaving them more seamlessly into your own sentences.
    *   **Analysis vs. Summary:** Make sure that you're always engaging in analysis, rather than just summarizing the content of the poem.

*   **Specific Examples:**
    *   **Page 1:** "Spenser indeed supplies Yeats with many of his favorite images: of enchanted trees and rivers, of questing heroes and Muses and goddesses and faeries." - This is a strong claim. Can you provide a specific example from Yeats's work that directly demonstrates this influence?
    *   **Page 3:** "marginalia in Yeats's working copy of Spenser shows his preoccupations with the texts:  'its connection to Ireland, its exaltation of Venus or Intellectual Beauty, and its relation to romantic poetry.'" - This is great, but follow this with more explanation of why Yeats might be focused on these aspects.  What about these things specifically appealed to him?
    *   **Page 6:**  When you're comparing "wandering through a darkly unknowable Celtic Otherworld pervades Spenser" with Yeats' poem. Be more specific about this comparison.
    *   **Page 10:** "Ruines of Times" - This is a great example, but unpack the comparison even further.

*   **"Views of the Present State of Ireland" Section:** This section is strong and important, connecting Spenser's political views to Yeats's own complex relationship with Irish identity and English literary heritage. Make sure to emphasize the ambivalence of Yeats.

*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the main points of your argument.
    *   Consider ending with a more thought-provoking statement about the lasting legacy of Spenser's influence on Yeats, or its relevance to understanding Irish literature and identity.

**Additional Points to Consider:**

*   **Title:** The title "The Faerie Kings: Yeats's Spenser" is good, but you could consider making it even more specific to reflect the paper's central argument. For example, something like "Reconciling Ireland: Spenser's Enduring Influence on Yeats" might be more descriptive.
*   **Proofreading:** Carefully proofread the paper for any grammatical errors or typos.

**In Summary:**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that demonstrates a strong understanding of both Yeats and Spenser. By strengthening the connections between your evidence and your claims, addressing potential counterarguments, and adding more clarity on your theoretical frameworks, you can elevate the paper to an even higher level. Good job!
