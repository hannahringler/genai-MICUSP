Here's some feedback on the paper, covering both its strengths and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impressions**

This is a well-structured and thoroughly researched literature review on a significant topic. It demonstrates a good understanding of the existing scholarship, identifies key debates, and offers insightful critiques and suggestions for future research. The writing is generally clear and academic.

**Strengths**

*   **Strong Topic Focus:** The paper stays tightly focused on the growing trend of part-time faculty at community colleges, addressing the causes, effects, and potential solutions.
*   **Clear Structure:** The organization into sections (Introduction, A Note on Terminology, Background of the Trend, Causes, Effects, Recommended Responses, Conclusion) makes the review easy to follow.  The sections on "Causes," "Effects," and "Recommended Responses" are particularly well-defined.
*   **Comprehensive Literature Review:**  The paper cites and summarizes a wide range of relevant sources, covering seminal works and more recent research. It's clear the author has done extensive reading on the topic.
*   **Critical Analysis:** The paper doesn't just summarize the literature; it analyzes and critiques the different perspectives, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  The critiques of Gappa and Leslie's work are particularly well-developed.
*   **Identification of Gaps:**  The paper effectively identifies gaps in the existing research, such as the need for more studies on student perspectives and the effects of part-time faculty at the department/division level.
*   **Suggestions for Future Research:** The recommendations for future research are specific, actionable, and directly address the identified gaps in the literature.
*   **Academic Tone:** The writing style is appropriate for a graduate-level academic paper.
*   **Effective Use of Evidence:** The paper uses quotes, paraphrases, and summaries of existing research to support its claims.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Depth of Discussion:** While the paper covers a lot of ground, it could benefit from a little more depth in certain areas. For example, the section on specific responses could delve more deeply into the details of those strategies.
*   **Clarity of Arguments:** While the paper includes discussion on many aspects of the topic, there could be greater clarity in arguments.
*   **Connecting Threads:** It would be beneficial to clarify links between sections to ensure the arguments are well-connected.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Expand on Terminology:** In the "A Note on Terminology" section, it could be helpful to mention how using a broader or narrower definition of "part-time faculty" might impact the research findings.
*   **Address Counterarguments More Fully:** When presenting the "Beneficial Effects" arguments, the paper acknowledges the opposing viewpoints but could engage with them more deeply. For example, why are these scholars overlooking some of the potential drawbacks of relying on part-time faculty?
*   **Strengthen Transitions:** Improve the transitions between sections and paragraphs to create a smoother flow of ideas.  Use transition words and phrases to signal the relationship between different points.
*   **Consider a Thematic Approach:** While the current organization is logical, consider if a thematic approach might provide more synthesis. For instance, you could group literature based on the type of research methodology employed (quantitative vs. qualitative) or the specific aspect of the topic being investigated (impact on student learning, impact on faculty morale, cost-effectiveness).

**Overall Grade Suggestion**

Given the strengths and minor weaknesses, this paper would likely receive a high grade (e.g., A- to A) in a graduate-level course.

I hope this feedback is helpful!
