Okay, I've read your paper, "Defining Wild Nature: A brief study of H. D. Thoreau, Gary Snyder, Robert Frost, and Mary Oliver." Here's a breakdown of feedback focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the selected authors and the complex concept of "wildness." You engage thoughtfully with their works and connect them in insightful ways. The writing is generally clear and well-organized, although there are areas where it could be sharpened.  The paper shows evidence of critical thinking and original thought.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis (Implied):** While not explicitly stated as a single sentence, the paper's purpose is clear: to explore the evolving and multifaceted definitions of "wildness" through the works of key American writers. You effectively trace how these authors grapple with and redefine the term.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** You offer nuanced interpretations of the authors' works, demonstrating a close reading of their texts. Your observations about Thoreau's "Walking," Snyder's redefinitions, and Frost's "Desert Places" are particularly strong.
*   **Effective Connections:** You successfully connect the authors' ideas and demonstrate how they build upon or diverge from each other. The link between Thoreau and Snyder's emphasis on "self-willed" nature is well-articulated. The contrast between their treatment of inhabitants is very compelling.
*   **Thoughtful Use of Etymology and Definition:** Your exploration of the etymology of words like "ferity" and "saunterer" demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of how language shapes our perception of nature. You deftly incorporate the OED and Turner's notes, supporting your arguments.
*   **Clear Writing (Generally):** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. You use appropriate academic language and provide sufficient context for your claims.
*   **Well-Organized Structure:** The paper is logically structured, moving from Thoreau and Snyder to Frost and Oliver, and then to a discussion of the Wilderness Act. Each section builds upon the previous one, creating a cohesive argument.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Thesis Statement (Make it Explicit):** While the paper's purpose is clear, making the thesis statement explicit early on would strengthen the introduction. For example, you could state: "This paper argues that Thoreau, Snyder, Frost, and Oliver, while drawing on Transcendentalist roots, offer distinct and evolving definitions of 'wildness,' emphasizing its unknowable nature, self-willed essence, and contested relationship to human inhabitation." This would give the reader a clear roadmap of your argument.
*   **Over-reliance on Quotation:** While you use quotations effectively to support your claims, there are instances where the paper could benefit from more paraphrasing and summarizing. This would allow you to showcase your understanding in your own voice and avoid the impression of simply stringing together quotes.
*   **Specificity in "Wilderness Act" Section:** The section on the Wilderness Act is well-intentioned, but it could be strengthened by more specific textual analysis of the Act itself. What specific language in the Act supports your claims? Consider focusing on a particular clause or phrase and unpacking its implications.
*   **Mary Oliver Section (Further Development):** The Mary Oliver section feels somewhat underdeveloped compared to the others. You acknowledge her aestheticizing tendencies, but you could delve deeper into how her portrayal of nature both aligns with and departs from the other authors. Consider analyzing another poem or exploring a specific theme in her work.
*   **Occasional Wordiness/Awkward Phrasing:** There are a few instances of wordiness or awkward phrasing that could be tightened up. For example:
    *   "Defining wildness even tracing another's definition can be a daunting project" could be simplified to "Defining wildness, even tracing another's definition, is a daunting project."
    *   "the contemporary Americans who are, knowingly or not, born from Transcendentalists" could be shortened to "contemporary Americans, knowingly or not, influenced by Transcendentalists."

*   **Avoid vague statements:** For example "The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the selected authors and the complex concept of "wildness".

*   **Consider a stronger conclusion:** While a mess is a nice idea, a strong conclusion could make an impactful statement. You could re-iterate how the writers shape or create the definition of wilderness through their works, and how we define ourselves based on this concept.

**Specific Examples and Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** In addition to an explicit thesis, consider adding a brief overview of the authors you will be discussing. This will help orient the reader and set the stage for your analysis.
*   **Thoreau's "Walking":** Your discussion of Thoreau's use of "ferity" is excellent. You could further strengthen this by exploring how Thoreau's own "walking" becomes a metaphor for the process of redefining wildness.
*   **Snyder's Redefinitions:** Your analysis of Snyder's use of the OED and his emphasis on "self-willed" nature is insightful. Consider exploring how Snyder's concept of "reinhabitation" relates to his definition of wildness.
*   **Frost's "Desert Places":** Your interpretation of the poem as an evocation of anxiety is compelling. You could further develop this by exploring the psychological implications of the speaker's "desert places."
*   **Wilderness Act:** Provide more details. Who signed the Wilderness Act, what was the impact of the legal definition on the common definition?

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that demonstrates a strong understanding of the complex concept of "wildness" and its portrayal in American literature. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can further strengthen your argument and enhance the clarity and impact of your writing. Good work!
