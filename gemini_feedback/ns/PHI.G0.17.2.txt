Here's some feedback on the philosophy paper:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper is well-organized. It introduces the topic, defines key terms, presents two different viewpoints, analyzes them, and offers a conclusion. This structure makes it easy to follow the argument.
*   **Engagement with Philosophical Concepts:** The paper engages with core philosophical concepts like omnipotence, logical possibility, and contradiction. It uses relevant examples (stone paradox, 3+7=grapefruit) to illustrate these concepts.
*   **Understanding of Key Philosophers:** The paper correctly references and summarizes the views of philosophers like Thomas Aquinas, Rosenkrantz, and Hoffman, demonstrating a grasp of their positions on omnipotence.
*   **Critical Analysis:** The paper goes beyond merely presenting definitions. It attempts to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each definition of omnipotence, providing a balanced perspective.
*   **Clear Language:** The writing is generally clear and accessible. You explain complex philosophical concepts in a way that an intelligent reader can understand.
*   **Modest and Reasonable Tone:** You maintain a humble and inquisitive tone throughout the paper, acknowledging the complexity of the topic and refraining from making definitive pronouncements. This is especially evident in the conclusion.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Engagement with Counterarguments:** While you acknowledge the weaknesses of the "God can do anything" definition, you could delve deeper into the potential problems with the "God can do anything logically possible" definition. Are there any criticisms of Aquinas' view? For example, some argue that "logical possibility" is itself subjective and depends on our limited understanding.
*   **Clarify "Logical Possibility":** The paper relies heavily on the concept of "logical possibility," but it could benefit from a more precise definition. What exactly makes something logically impossible? Is it simply anything that contradicts our current understanding of the laws of nature? Exploring these questions would add depth to your analysis.
*   **Elaboration on the "Limitations" of Logical Omnipotence:** Your point that limiting God to logical possibilities *still* limits God is very important. Push this argument further. If logic is a *human* construct, is God somehow bound by *our* conceptions? Some philosophers might argue that a truly infinite and transcendent being would not be constrained by logic as we understand it.
*   **Connect to Broader Theological Implications:** While the paper focuses on omnipotence, it could briefly touch on the broader theological implications. How does one's understanding of omnipotence affect other doctrines, such as free will, the problem of evil, or the nature of God's relationship with the world?
*   **More Specificity on "Coursepack":** It would be beneficial to cite specific articles or essays within the "Coursepack" if possible. This would allow for a more precise understanding of the source material.
*   **Strengthen the Conclusion:** The conclusion could be a little stronger. While acknowledging the complexity of the topic is good, you could still try to offer a more definitive stance, even if it is tentative. Perhaps you could suggest which definition of omnipotence you find more compelling and why, without claiming to have solved the problem definitively.
*   **Consider Alternative Definitions:** While you present two definitions, it might be worth mentioning that there are other approaches to understanding omnipotence. Some theologians, for example, define it in terms of God's ability to do *everything that is consistent with God's nature.*

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Clarify Intrinsic:** Briefly explain why the definition of omnipotence seems intrinsic. Is it because it aligns with a common intuition about what it means for God to be all-powerful?
*   **Aquinas' "Consistently Described":** Elaborate on what Aquinas meant by "consistently described."
*   **Strengthen Argument for the "Our Logic May Not Fit in the Realm of Possibility":**
    *   Provide another example of how our logic may not fit in the realm of possibility.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and thoughtful paper that demonstrates a solid understanding of the philosophical issues surrounding omnipotence. By addressing the areas for improvement, you can further strengthen your analysis and create a more compelling argument. The feedback provided is meant to help you take the paper to the next level by adding more depth and nuance to your analysis.

Good luck!
