Here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on areas for improvement in terms of clarity, organization, scientific rigor, and style:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Interesting Topic:** Nest selection is a fascinating area of behavioral ecology.
*   **Literature Review:** The paper incorporates findings from several relevant studies.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper follows a logical progression, with an introduction, sections on chick development, nest location, color preference, and a conclusion.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarity and Specificity:**

    *   **Thesis Statement:**  The introduction could benefit from a more explicit thesis statement.  While the question "what in fact makes a nest suitable for a certain species of bird" is stated, it would be strengthened by previewing the main arguments or factors you will discuss.
    *   **Operational Definitions:** Define key terms like "suitable" or "success." How is nest success measured (e.g., fledging rate, number of chicks hatched, nest survival time)?
    *   **Quantify Claims:** Avoid vague statements like "majority of birds."  Provide specific percentages or numbers when possible.
    *   **Connect Ideas Explicitly:**  Make the connections between different points clearer. For example, after discussing chick development, explicitly state how this links to the need for different nest characteristics.
    *   **Specify Weaver Species:** While the paper mentions Village and Baya Weavers, it sometimes jumps between them without clear distinction. Emphasize whether a point specifically applies to one species or both.

2.  **Organization and Flow:**

    *   **Transitions:** Improve transitions between paragraphs and sections to create a smoother flow. Use transitional phrases that signal the relationship between ideas (e.g., "In addition to...", "However...", "Therefore...").
    *   **Logical Order:** While the paper is generally well-structured, consider whether the order of sections is the most logical.  Perhaps combine the "Chick Development" information more closely with the "Nest Location" section, as the chick's developmental stage strongly influences nest needs.

3.  **Scientific Rigor and Analysis:**

    *   **Critical Analysis:** Instead of just summarizing the studies (Quader, Collias), offer more critical analysis. What are the limitations of these studies? Are there conflicting findings in the literature? What are the potential confounding variables?
    *   **Statistical Significance:**  When discussing the studies, mention whether the results were statistically significant. The p-values are presented in Table 3, but their significance needs to be discussed.
    *   **Control Groups:**  In the Collias' color selection study, emphasize the importance of control groups (birds that were not deprived of normal nesting material).

4.  **Style and Tone:**

    *   **Formal Language:**  Maintain a consistently formal and academic tone throughout the paper. Avoid colloquialisms.
    *   **Third Person:** Stick to the third person (e.g., "The study found..." instead of "I find it fascinating..."). The final sentence of the paper shifts to a first-person perspective and needs to be adjusted.
    *   **Conciseness:**  Eliminate unnecessary words or phrases to make the writing more concise.

5.  **Figures and Tables:**

    *   **Figure 1:** Provide a brief description of what the numbers on the plot are.
    *   **Table Descriptions:** Ensure the captions for the tables are descriptive and informative.
    *   **Referencing Tables:** Make sure that the tables are referenced in the text of the paper.

**Specific Examples of Improvements:**

*   **Introduction:**  Instead of just saying, "This leads to the main question," you could say, "This paper will explore the key factors influencing nest site selection in Village and Baya Weavers, including the developmental stage of the chicks, nest location, and the color of nesting materials. We will critically evaluate existing research to determine the relative importance of these factors in determining nest suitability."
*   **Chick Development:**  After introducing the developmental stages, explain *why* altricial chicks (stage 8) require more protection than precocial chicks.
*   **Color Preference:**  Discuss potential reasons for the preference of green.  Is it camouflage? Does it indicate fresh, strong materials?
*   **Conclusion:**  Rather than stating that bird nest selections are common sense, give an example of what selection might be deemed "common sense" and then mention that there is other selection criteria at play in the species of focus.
*   **Conclusion:** In the conclusion, summarize the main points and offer a more definitive statement about the relative importance of different factors. Also, suggest directions for future research.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a good starting point. By addressing the points above, you can significantly strengthen the paper, making it more compelling, rigorous, and insightful. Focus on providing more specific details, critical analysis, and clear connections between ideas.
