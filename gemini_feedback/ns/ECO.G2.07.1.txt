Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on your paper, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions.

**Overall Impression:**

This is a promising start to a research proposal. You've clearly identified an interesting and relevant research question building on existing work by Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz. The proposal demonstrates an understanding of the key literature and the potential implications of your research. However, it needs further development to become a stronger and more convincing proposal.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Research Question:** You clearly state your intention to examine shotgun marriages in the decades *before* the period studied by Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz, and to extend their analysis to more recent surveys. This is well-defined.
*   **Motivation:** You effectively motivate the research by highlighting its connection to important social issues such as the feminization of poverty, single-parent homes, and policy implications. You make a good case for the relevance of this topic.
*   **Literature Review:** You show familiarity with the core paper by Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz, which is essential.
*   **Methodological Awareness:** You acknowledge the data challenges and potential issues of misreporting, showing critical thinking about your data sources.
*   **Data Sources Identified:** You've already started to identify potential data sources, which is great (Vital Statistics, CPS, NSFG, IPUMS).

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Specificity of Research Question:** While the overall question is clear, you need to be *more specific* about the *hypotheses* you intend to test. What are you expecting to find? Will shotgun marriage rates increase, decrease, or remain stable in the decades before 1965? Will there be any correlation to other factors such as economic factors?
*   **Theoretical Framework:** You mention "economic conditions and institutions" as possible factors. You need to develop a more explicit *theoretical framework*. What economic or sociological theories might explain the trends you're investigating? (e.g., changes in women's labor force participation, changes in social norms, access to contraception, etc.)
*   **Methodology - More Detail Needed:** The methodology section is currently weak. You need to provide more detail on:
    *   **How you will define "shotgun marriage" operationally.** (e.g., marriage within X months of birth) What cutoff will you use and why?
    *   **Specific variables you will use from each data source.**
    *   **Statistical methods:** What statistical techniques will you employ to analyze the data (e.g., regression analysis, time series analysis)? How will you control for potential confounding variables?
*   **Addressing Data Limitations:** You acknowledge the issue of data limitations and potential misreporting, but you need to *propose specific strategies* for addressing these issues. How will you deal with missing data? How will you assess the sensitivity of your results to different assumptions about misreporting?
*   **Expected Contributions:** What *new insights* do you anticipate gaining from this research? How will your findings contribute to the existing literature?
*   **Clarity and Flow:** While generally well-written, the proposal could benefit from improved clarity and flow in some sections. For instance, the paragraph about the GAF surveys feels a bit disjointed.

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Develop Clear Hypotheses:** Instead of just saying you want to "look at the decades preceding," state specific hypotheses. For example:
    *   "Shotgun marriage rates were [higher/lower/stable] in the 1950s and early 1960s compared to the period studied by Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz."
    *   "Changes in women's labor force participation are associated with [increases/decreases] in shotgun marriage rates."
    *   "Increased access to contraception is correlated with [decreases] in shotgun marriage rates, even before legalization of abortion."

2.  **Expand on Theoretical Framework:** Discuss potential economic and sociological theories that might explain changes in shotgun marriage rates. Consider factors such as:
    *   Changes in social norms around premarital sex and marriage.
    *   The economic opportunities available to women.
    *   The availability and affordability of contraception.
    *   Government policies related to welfare and family support.

3.  **Provide More Methodological Detail:**
    *   **Operational Definition:** Be explicit about how you will define "shotgun marriage" based on the available data (e.g., marriage occurring within 8 months of the birth).
    *   **Variable Selection:** List specific variables you plan to use from each data source (e.g., age, education, income, marital status, birth date, marriage date, gestation length, etc.).
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Describe the statistical methods you will use (e.g., regression analysis to examine the relationship between shotgun marriage rates and other variables, controlling for potential confounders).  Be as specific as possible.
    *   **Address Misreporting:** How will you assess the potential impact of misreporting of gestation length or marriage dates?  Will you use sensitivity analysis?

4.  **Discuss Data Limitations More Strategically:**
    *   Instead of just acknowledging limitations, propose *specific strategies* to mitigate them.
    *   For example, if you suspect misreporting of gestation length, you could compare reported gestation lengths to medical literature and flag outliers. You could also perform a sensitivity analysis, excluding outliers to see if your results change.
    *   If some data is missing, consider imputation techniques.

5.  **Clarify Expected Contributions:**
    *   How will your research extend or challenge the findings of Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz?
    *   What new insights will you provide about the relationship between shotgun marriage, social change, and economic conditions?
    *   How might your findings inform current policy debates?

6.  **Refine Writing and Organization:**
    *   Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs.
    *   Use precise language.
    *   Proofread carefully for grammatical errors and typos.
    *   Consider adding headings and subheadings to improve organization.

**Revised Example Excerpt (Illustrative):**

"This study hypothesizes that shotgun marriage rates were significantly higher in the decades preceding the period studied by Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz (1965-1989), reflecting differing social norms and economic conditions.  Specifically, it is hypothesized that increased economic opportunities for women, coupled with gradually increasing access to contraception, led to a decline in shotgun marriage rates even before widespread legalization of abortion. To test these hypotheses, this study will utilize data from the Vital Statistics of the United States (1945-1965), the June Supplements to the Current Population Surveys (1950-1965), and the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS).  'Shotgun marriage' will be defined operationally as a first marriage occurring within eight months of the birth of the first child. This cutoff point is chosen because... [explain your reasoning]. Key variables to be analyzed include... [list specific variables].  To address potential issues of misreporting of gestation length, reported gestation lengths will be compared to medically accepted ranges, and outliers will be excluded in a sensitivity analysis. Data will be analyzed using [statistical method], controlling for... The expected contribution of this research is to... [explain expected new insights and contributions to literature]."

By addressing these points, you can transform your proposal into a stronger and more compelling document. Good luck!
