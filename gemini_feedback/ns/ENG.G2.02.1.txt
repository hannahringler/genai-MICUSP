Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper. To give you the most helpful feedback, I need to focus on several areas:

**Overall Impression and Argument:**

*   **Clarity of Argument:** I need to understand what the central argument is. Is it about Lewisohn's theory of adaptation and its relationship to Jewish identity? Is it about how *The Island Within* attempts to resolve the problem of authentic Jewish-American identity through narrative? The clearer you can make the thesis, the better.
*   **Originality/Insight:** Does the paper offer a new perspective on Lewisohn or his work? Does it make a compelling connection between adaptation theory and Jewish identity? The "so what?" factor is important. Why is this analysis important?
*   **Structure:** Is the paper logically organized? Does each paragraph contribute to the overall argument? Are there clear transitions between paragraphs?
*   **Depth of Analysis:** Does the paper go beyond simply summarizing Lewisohn's views and the plot of *The Island Within*? Does it delve into the nuances of his arguments and the complexities of the novel?

**Specific Areas for Improvement:**

Here's a breakdown of what I noticed and could use further refinement:

*   **Introduction:** The introduction is a bit dense and assumes a lot of prior knowledge on the part of the reader. It would benefit from being a bit more accessible and clearly stating the paper's thesis. For example, after introducing Lewisohn's adaptation argument, explicitly state how it relates to the issue of Jewish identity, and then state that the purpose of the paper is to examine how Lewisohnâ€™s *The Island Within* attempts to resolve these issues.
*   **Connection of Lewisohn's adaptation theory to Jewish identity:** It's not immediately obvious how the issue of adapting foreign plays is connected to the experience of Jewish Americans trying to assimilate. How does this idea of "unperformability" or "homelessness" map onto the experience of Jewish-Americans? You need to make this connection more explicit.
*   **More analysis and evidence:** It seemed to only quote passages. To make the analysis stronger, elaborate on your points and provide a counterargument of some sorts.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion should summarize the main points of the paper and restate the thesis in a new way. It should also offer a final thought or implication of the analysis.

**Questions to Consider While Revising:**

*   What is the central problem that *The Island Within* is trying to solve? How does it attempt to solve it?
*   How does the novel's structure (family saga, narrative digressions) contribute to its argument about Jewish identity?
*   What is the role of memory and heritage in Lewisohn's conception of Jewish identity?
*   What are the limitations or contradictions in Lewisohn's approach?

I can give you more specific and targeted feedback once you've clarified the argument and revised the paper based on these initial suggestions. Let me know if you have any questions.
