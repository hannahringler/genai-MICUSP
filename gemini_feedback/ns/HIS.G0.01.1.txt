Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a clear and well-organized analysis of Ralph Martin's views, particularly as expressed in "Unless the Lord Build the House," within the context of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal and its relationship to the Vatican II Council. The author demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and the theological nuances involved. The paper effectively highlights the tension between Martin's criticisms of the Church and his continued identification as a Catholic.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The paper establishes a clear thesis regarding Martin's complex relationship to the Catholic Church and the Vatican II Council, specifically regarding his renewal efforts.
*   **Organization:** The paper is well-organized with a logical flow of ideas. The introduction sets the stage, the body paragraphs develop the argument with supporting evidence, and the conclusion summarizes the main points.
*   **Evidence-Based Analysis:** The author effectively uses quotes from Martin's book to support their claims, and the parenthetical citations are generally accurate.
*   **Understanding of Context:** The author demonstrates a solid grasp of the historical context of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal and the significance of Vatican II.
*   **Nuance and Complexity:** The paper acknowledges the complexities of Martin's position, avoiding simplistic generalizations. The author recognizes the nuances of his criticisms and his relationship with the Church.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Analysis:** While the paper provides a good overview, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of *why* Martin held these views and what theological or personal factors might have influenced him. Consider exploring the *reasons behind* his criticisms of Vatican II.
*   **Counterarguments/Alternative Perspectives:** A stronger paper would address potential counterarguments or alternative interpretations of Martin's work. Were there other contemporary Catholics who shared his views? How did other Charismatic Renewal leaders respond to Vatican II? Acknowledging differing perspectives strengthens the overall argument.
*   **Clarity of Specific Theological Points:** The paper mentions theological jargon and orthodoxy. Providing slightly more explanation of these specific theological issues would make the arguments more accessible to readers not familiar with Catholic theology.
*   **Avoid Overstatements:** Phrases like "Martin, in many ways, sounds more like a fundamental Protestant evangelist than a Roman Catholic" can be softened. While you make a good point about his emphasis on scripture and personal conversion, avoid generalizations. Consider rephrasing to something like: "Martin's emphasis on a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and reliance on scripture in his arguments echoes certain themes found in Protestant evangelicalism."

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Consider adding a sentence or two to the introduction that explicitly states the *significance* of Martin's views. Why is it important to understand his perspective? What broader implications does it have for understanding the Catholic Charismatic Renewal or the post-Vatican II Church?
*   **Page 2:** When you mention his criticisms "misdirected," ‘tragic results', etc., consider giving a brief example of *what* he was referring to. For instance, "Martin viewed the liturgical changes following Vatican II as ‘tragic results', pointing to what he saw as a loss of reverence in the Mass."
*   **Page 3:** Elaborate briefly on what specific “Christian social principles or morality” Catholics were emphasizing, and what aspects of the “redemptive work of Christ” Martin felt were being neglected.
*   **Page 3 & 4:** Regarding the criticism of lay involvement, explain further why he thought these weren't "Christian action." Is he saying social action is unimportant, or that it's not enough?
*   **Page 4:** Briefly mention who Steve Clark is, and what his contrasting style was like.
*   **Conclusion:** Strengthen the conclusion by reiterating the main points of the analysis and offering a final, insightful observation about Martin's legacy or the broader implications of his views.
*   **Proofread:** Carefully proofread for any minor grammatical errors or typos.

**Example Revisions:**

*   **Original:** "Martin, in many ways, sounds more like a fundamental Protestant evangelist than a Roman Catholic."
*   **Revised:** "Martin's emphasis on a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, his reliance on scripture to support his arguments, and his focus on individual conversion echo certain themes found in Protestant evangelicalism, although he remained firmly within the Catholic tradition."
*   **Original:** "The Liturgical changes were almost invariably superficial."
*   **Revised:** "The Liturgical changes were almost invariably superficial. Martin argued that the changes didn't go far enough to engage individuals and that the Church should return to older traditions."

By addressing these areas for improvement, you can elevate the paper to a higher level of analysis and provide a more nuanced and compelling account of Ralph Martin's complex and significant views. Good luck!
