Here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper offers a sociological analysis of the movie *The 40-Year-Old Virgin*, applying concepts like sexual natural attitude (SNA), symbolic interactionism, and gender norms. The paper shows a good understanding of these sociological concepts and makes an effort to apply them to specific scenes and dialogues in the film. The paper is creative and demonstrates a good amount of research.

**Strengths:**

*   **Application of Sociological Concepts:** The paper successfully identifies and applies relevant sociological concepts to analyze the film. The explanation of SNA and the binary systems of sex and gender is well-integrated.
*   **Specific Examples:** The paper uses specific examples and quotes from the film to support its arguments. This makes the analysis concrete and engaging.
*   **Understanding of Theory:** The author shows a good understanding of the sociological theories discussed, particularly those of McGann, Weeks, and Plummer.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper has a clear introduction that states the main argument and a conclusion that summarizes the findings.
*   **Bibliography:** Includes a brief but solid bibliography of resources cited within the work.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** In some areas, the analysis could be more developed. While the paper identifies relevant concepts, it sometimes stops short of fully exploring their implications. Consider elaborating on *why* these examples are important. How does one example connect to the next to form larger social attitudes?
*   **Clarity of Argument:** While the structure is clear, the overall argument could be sharpened. Specifically, how does Andy's experience simultaneously reinforce and challenge society's views on sex and gender? Is the message ultimately positive, negative, or something in between?
*   **Transitions:** Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt. This can make it difficult for the reader to follow the argument.
*   **Voice:** Academic essays should be in an objective tone, avoiding too much subjective opinion.
*   **Typos and Grammar Errors:** There are several minor typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper that need to be corrected.
*   **Citation Format:** Ensure consistency in citation format.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Elaborate on the Contradictions:** The paper mentions that the movie both strengthens and breaks down aspects of SNA. Elaborate on this tension. How does the movie challenge dominant narratives surrounding virginity and sex?
*   **Further Development of Ideas:** After presenting an example, ask "So what?" Expand on the implications of your observations. Connect each example back to your main argument.
*   **Connect to Broader Social Context:** Consider discussing the broader social context surrounding virginity and sexual expectations.
*   **Strengthen Transitions:** Use transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas and paragraphs. This will improve the flow of the paper.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper carefully for typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing.
*   **Refine Thesis Statement:** Make sure the thesis is concise and outlines the purpose of the paper.
*   **Improve Referencing:**
    *   Incorporate referencing into your sentences and not just in parenthesis at the end.
    *   Incite sources in the bibliography directly after quoting or paraphrasing.

**Specific Examples to Consider:**

*   **"entertaining movie" and "looking through my sociological lens:"** Consider avoiding conversational phrases like these, unless you intend for the tone to be playful.
*   **"First thing I noticed was that they do not regard sex and sexuality as a private, individual thing."** This is a solid observation. Now, dig deeper: *Why* is this significant? What does it say about societal norms?
*   **"I can't tell you the last boss I had that knew my sexual activities because there hasn't been."** This anecdotal comment doesn't contribute meaningfully to the analysis.

**In summary,** this paper demonstrates a strong understanding of sociological concepts and their application to film analysis. By strengthening the argument, elaborating on key points, and improving the overall writing, the paper can be further enhanced.
