Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper based on the OCR text you've provided.  Please note that since I don't have access to the *actual* formatting, figures, or interactive elements of the survey, my feedback will primarily focus on the content, argumentation, structure, clarity, and style based on the text.

**Overall Impressions:**

*   **Ambitious and Thorough:** The paper tackles a complex topic (multiple hedging in academic writing) with a comprehensive review of existing literature and an original empirical study. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the field and a willingness to grapple with nuanced issues.
*   **Well-Researched:** The literature review is extensive and covers a wide range of perspectives on hedging, overhedging, and underhedging. The inclusion of textbooks used for teaching academic writing adds a practical dimension to the discussion.
*   **Original Empirical Study:** The corpus analysis and survey provide valuable insights into the frequency and perception of multiple hedging.
*   **Clear Goals:** The paper sets out clear goals and aims to address a gap in the existing literature.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Literature Review:** The review of hedging definitions, taxonomies, and the discussions of over/under-hedging are well-done. The author carefully considers different viewpoints and justifies their own approach. You are not just summarizing the literature, but analyzing and synthesizing it.
*   **Justification of Methodology:** The author clearly explains and justifies the choices made in their methodology (selecting specific linguistic items for corpus analysis, designing the survey, and selecting the participant groups).
*   **Thoughtful Data Analysis:** The analysis of the corpus data and survey results is thoughtful and nuanced. The author acknowledges the limitations of the study (e.g., small sample size for the survey) and avoids making overly strong claims.
*   **Clear Writing Style:** The writing is generally clear and well-organized, although some sections could benefit from further streamlining (see suggestions below).
*   **Acknowledges Limitations:** A great strength of this paper is that you acknowledge and address the shortcomings of your research and areas where the findings are not conclusive. This increases the paper's credibility.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Tighten the Introduction:**

    *   While the introduction is comprehensive, it could be more concise and focused. Consider restructuring it to immediately highlight the *specific gap* in the literature that the paper addresses (the attitudes to multiple hedging) and explicitly state the research questions.
    *   Clearly state the paper's organization: "First, I will... Second, I will... Finally, I will..."
2.  **Refine the Definition of Hedging:**

    *   Although the author spends considerable time discussing various definitions of hedging, it may be beneficial to create a distinct, clear definition that you adopt for the purposes of your paper. While it is good to state you are using Crompton's framework, you could strengthen your point by synthesizing the features from the different papers and giving your specific definition of hedging and the terms you will be using.
3.  **Elaborate on the Corpus Search Methodology:**

    *   The explanation of the corpus search methodology could be more detailed. Specifically:
        *   Clarify what search commands were used and why.
        *   Provide examples of "irrelevant entries" that were excluded.
        *   Explain the criteria for identifying other hedging expressions in the immediate context.
        *   Justify the decision to exclude citations in your analysis.
    *   Consider presenting the corpus data in a more visually appealing way (e.g., tables or graphs).
4.  **Strengthen the Analysis of Survey Results:**

    *   The analysis of the survey results is somewhat descriptive. Consider going deeper into the reasons *why* the different groups responded the way they did.
    *   Address the potential biases inherent in the survey design (e.g., the multiple-choice format might have influenced the participants' choices).
    *   Discuss the limitations of the small sample size and the potential impact on the generalizability of the findings.
    *   Given that the ELI students were taking a class on dissertation writing, you could include data about their prior research and writing experience.
5.  **Clarify the Connection Between Corpus Analysis and Survey Results:**

    *   The paper would benefit from a clearer discussion of how the corpus analysis and survey results relate to each other. How do the findings from the corpus analysis inform the interpretation of the survey results, and vice versa?
6.  **Strengthen the Conclusion:**

    *   The conclusion could be more concise and impactful. Summarize the key findings of the study and reiterate the significance of the research.
    *   Offer more specific recommendations for EAP teachers and textbook authors.
    *   Suggest avenues for future research that build on the findings of this study.
7.  **Editing and Proofreading:**

    *   Carefully proofread the paper for any grammatical errors or typos.
    *   Check for consistency in terminology and formatting.
    *   Pay attention to sentence structure and flow.

**Specific Suggestions (by Section):**

*   **Introduction:**  As mentioned earlier, tighten and focus.
*   **Literature Review:** The literature review is strong. Good job, but ensure all sources are properly cited and formatted according to a consistent style guide.
*   **Methods:** Add more detail about the corpus search methodology.
*   **Results:**  Consider presenting the corpus data in a more visually appealing way (e.g., tables or graphs).
*   **Discussion:** Go deeper into the reasons *why* the different groups responded the way they did in the survey.
*   **Conclusion:** Summarize the key findings more concisely and offer more specific recommendations.

**Overall:**

This is a very good paper that demonstrates strong research skills and a deep understanding of the topic. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, the author can further strengthen the paper and make it even more impactful.
