**Overall Impressions (Based on the Partial Text)**

From what I can read, this paper appears to be a well-researched and thoughtful analysis of Gwendolyn Brooks's *Maud Martha*, particularly in relation to social engagement and a concept you're calling "creative multivalence." You are also comparing it with Richard Wright's *Native Son*.

**Specific Feedback:**

**1. Clarity and Argument:**

*   **Central Argument:** The introduction lays out the argument reasonably well.  You state that you find the concept of "nuance" in previous criticisms problematic, and you propose an alternative reading based on "creative multivalence." You'll then explore it through the novel, connecting it to Brooks's commentary, examine the rat/mouse scene, and finally, discuss the consciousness of the protagonist.
*   **Argument Development:** It's important to ensure that each section of the essay clearly connects back to this central idea of "creative multivalence" and how it represents a new form of social engagement. Make sure you consistently define and apply this concept throughout the paper.
*   **Thesis Strength:** The thesis could be a bit more focused. Consider refining it to more specifically articulate *how* Brooks innovates a new form of social engagement through this "creative multivalence." What *specific* techniques does she employ, and what are the *implications* of this approach?

**2. Analysis:**

*   **Insightful Observations:** You are making some very insightful observations, such as the analysis of the "pioneer women" passage and the duplicity of Martha's feelings during the "brotherly love" chapter. Make sure you explore them in full.
*   **Deeper Dive:** In some places, the analysis could be pushed further. For example, when you discuss the "I did not want my body to fail" quote, you acknowledge the complexity, but perhaps you could offer a more concrete interpretation, even if it's tentative.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** The comparison between *Maud Martha* and *Native Son* is a good strategy. Make sure you clearly articulate the *specific* points of comparison and contrast and *why* these differences matter in terms of the authors' social engagement.

**3. Structure and Organization:**

*   **Clear Roadmap:** The introduction provides a clear roadmap for the essay.
*   **Paragraph Transitions:** Ensure that each paragraph transitions smoothly from the previous one, building a cohesive argument. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas.
*   **Concluding Sections:** Ensure each point closes with a clear link to your thesis.
*   **Conclusion:** The provided text doesn't include a conclusion, but it will be crucial to effectively summarize your argument, reiterate your thesis (perhaps in a more nuanced form), and leave the reader with a lasting impression of the significance of your analysis.

**4. Use of Evidence:**

*   **Effective Quotations:** You use quotations effectively to illustrate your points.
*   **Balance:** Maintain a good balance between quoting and analyzing. Don't let the quotations speak for themselves; always provide your own interpretation.
*   **Quote Integration:** Ensure that quotations are smoothly integrated into your sentences. Vary your methods of introducing quotations.

**5. Style and Tone:**

*   **Academic Tone:** The writing is generally academic in tone.
*   **Clarity:** In a few places, the language could be more concise. For example, phrases like "sort of layering" could be made more precise.
*   **Confidence:** Write with confidence in your own interpretations.

**Specific Suggestions by Page:**

*   **Page 1:**
    *   Clarify what you mean by "troubled" when discussing the question of "nuance."
    *   The last sentence is a good overview.
*   **Page 2:**
    *   The long quotation from Brooks is effective, but make sure you clearly explain its significance in relation to your argument about multivalence.
    *   Clearly state *how* the novel takes on racism.
*   **Page 3:**
    *   Excellent point about the word choice of "pioneer women" and its implications.
    *   Expand on the question "beautiful to whom?"
*   **Page 4:**
    *   Good analysis of the "Sex in the Married Life" passage.
*   **Page 5:**
    *   The analysis of Maud Martha's "sweet" framing is insightful.
*   **Page 6:**
    *   Continue to explore why the body "might fail at some sort of test."
*   **Page 7:**
    *   Good job connecting the chicken and the mouse.

**To improve your paper, consider the following:**

*   **Clearly define "creative multivalence"** and use this term consistently throughout your paper.
*   **Strengthen your thesis** to more specifically articulate *how* Brooks's approach to social engagement is innovative.
*   **Push your analysis deeper,** offering more concrete interpretations of ambiguous passages.
*   **Ensure smooth transitions** between paragraphs.
*   **Write a strong conclusion** that summarizes your argument and leaves a lasting impression.
*   **Proofread carefully** for any errors in grammar or mechanics.
