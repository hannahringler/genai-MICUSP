*   **Content and Analysis:** Is the information accurate and relevant? Does the paper go beyond simple description and offer insightful analysis? Are sources used effectively to support claims?
*   **Structure and Organization:** Is the paper well-organized with clear topic sentences and transitions? Is there a logical flow of ideas? Does the conclusion effectively summarize the main points and provide closure?
*   **Evidence and Support:** Are claims supported with sufficient evidence from credible sources? Are sources properly cited? Is there a balance between summary and analysis of the evidence?
*   **Grammar, Mechanics, and Style:** Is the writing clear, concise, and grammatically correct? Is the tone appropriate for the intended audience? Are there any issues with spelling, punctuation, or formatting?

**Overall Feedback**

This is a good start to mapping out the network of actors involved in the offshore drilling debate. You've identified key players and their motivations, providing a solid foundation for further analysis. The paper is generally well-organized and uses sources effectively. However, there are areas where you could strengthen the analysis, add more depth, and refine the arguments.

**Specific suggestions for improvement**

1.  **Expand on the Interconnections and Relationships:** While you identify the key actors, explore the relationships between them more deeply.

    *   How do they collaborate, compete, or influence each other?
    *   Are there coalitions or alliances that emerge?
    *   Are there instances of conflicting interests within groups (e.g., among different oil companies or environmental groups)?
    *   **Power Dynamics:** Analyze the power dynamics within the network. Who holds the most influence, and how do they exert it? How do actors with less power attempt to influence the debate?
    *   **Action Channels:** You mention the ENR committee as the primary action channel. Go deeper:
        *   How do different actors try to access and influence this channel?
        *   What strategies do they use (lobbying, campaign contributions, public pressure)?
        *   Are there alternative action channels (e.g., the courts, public opinion) that actors use when they can't access the ENR committee effectively?

2.  **Deepen the Analysis of Motivations:** You provide a good overview of each actor's motivations, but try to delve deeper.

    *   **Economic Factors:** Elaborate on the economic incentives driving the oil industry's support for drilling, and the economic concerns of coastal states and environmental groups.
    *   **Political Ideology:** How do political ideologies (e.g., conservative, liberal, libertarian) shape the actors' positions?
    *   **Public Opinion:** How does public opinion influence the actions of elected officials? Have shifts in public opinion affected the debate?
    *   **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Interests:** Are there trade-offs between short-term economic gains and long-term environmental sustainability? How do different actors weigh these considerations?

3.  **Provide More Context:** Briefly introduce the history of offshore drilling debates in the US. This will help readers understand the current context and the evolution of the network.

4.  **Refine the Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the key findings of your network analysis.
    *   What are the implications of this network structure for the future of offshore drilling policy?
    *   Are there potential areas for compromise or conflict?
    *   Are there any alternative approaches or solutions that could address the concerns of different actors?

5.  **Strengthen the Introduction**
    *   **Clearly State the Research Question:**  What specific question are you trying to answer with your network analysis?
    *   **Preview Key Findings:** Briefly mention the main actors you'll be discussing and the key dynamics you'll be exploring.
    *   **Expand on the "Polarizing Nature":** Elaborate on why the offshore drilling debate is so divisive. What are the core values and beliefs that are in conflict?

6.  **Address Potential Biases**
    *   **Acknowledge limitations:** Are there any limitations to your analysis (e.g., data availability, scope)?
    *   **Consider alternative perspectives:** Have you considered all sides of the issue fairly? Are there any perspectives that are underrepresented?

**Specific Examples from the Text:**

*   **"Given its polarizing nature..."**: Expand on *why* it's polarizing. What are the core values or beliefs that cause the division?
*   **"Oil Industry: Oil companies are, unsurprisingly..."**: While it might be "unsurprising," avoid stating the obvious. Instead, jump right into the *specifics* of their involvement and motivations.
*   **"Environmental Groups: Most environmental groups oppose any kind of offshore drilling..."**: You could add a sentence acknowledging that some environmental groups might have nuanced positions or be willing to consider certain types of drilling under specific conditions (e.g., with strict environmental safeguards).
*   **"Democratic Leadership" and "Republican Leadership"**: Be careful about attributing *sole* influence to individual leaders. While they play a significant role, decisions are usually influenced by a variety of factors, including party dynamics, constituent pressure, and committee processes.

By addressing these suggestions, you can elevate your paper from a solid overview to a more insightful and compelling analysis of the offshore drilling issue network.
