Okay, I can provide feedback on your paper. To give you the most helpful feedback, I'll focus on several key areas:

*   **Clarity and Focus of Argument:** How well does the paper establish a clear thesis and maintain focus on it throughout? Does the paper consistently address the "intention vs. effect" framework?
*   **Analysis and Interpretation:** How insightful and nuanced is the analysis of Avedon's photographs and their relationship to Baldwin's text? Does the paper move beyond simple description to offer deeper interpretations?
*   **Use of Evidence:** How effectively does the paper use specific examples from the photographs, Baldwin's writing, and secondary sources to support its claims?
*   **Structure and Organization:** How logically is the paper organized? Do the transitions between paragraphs and sections flow smoothly?
*   **Engagement with Existing Scholarship:** How well does the paper engage with existing scholarship on Avedon, photography, and ethics? Are the sources used effectively and critically?
*   **Writing Style and Mechanics:** Is the writing clear, concise, and grammatically correct?

**Overall Impressions:**

Your paper tackles a complex and ethically charged topic. You demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant theoretical concepts (Sontag, Brecht, Sekula), and you make an effort to analyze the photographs in detail. The exploration of Avedon's personal connection to mental illness is a valuable addition. However, the paper could benefit from a sharper focus and more decisive argumentation.

**Specific Feedback:**

**1. Clarity and Focus of Argument:**

*   **Thesis:** While you introduce the "intention vs. effect" framework early on, the central argument of the paper could be more sharply defined. What specific point are you ultimately trying to make about the ethical implications of Avedon's work, given the gap between his intentions and the potential effects on the subjects and viewers? Try to condense the essence of the paper into a clear, concise thesis statement that appears early in the introduction.
*   **Maintaining Focus:** There are moments where the paper seems to drift somewhat. For example, the discussion of genre (documentary, photo-text) is interesting but could be more directly tied back to the core argument about intention, effect, and ethics. Make sure each paragraph directly contributes to the overarching thesis.

**2. Analysis and Interpretation:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** You offer insightful observations about the photographs, such as the contrast between the controlled studio portraits and the more raw, documentary style of the inmate photos. However, you could push your analysis further by exploring the *specific* visual elements that contribute to the intended effect (or the gap between intention and effect). For example, you mention the "grainy and overexposed" quality. How does this *specifically* affect the viewer's perception of the subjects?
*   **Baldwin's Text:** The relationship between Avedon's photographs and Baldwin's text is central to your argument. You could strengthen the analysis by delving deeper into how Baldwin's themes of alienation, consumerism, and racial injustice resonate (or clash) with the images of the inmates.

**3. Use of Evidence:**

*   **Specific Examples:** You provide URLs to some of the photographs, which is helpful. You could incorporate *more* specific visual descriptions into your analysis, allowing the reader to "see" what you are seeing. Instead of just saying "the woman lying in bed," describe her pose, her expression, the lighting, and other relevant details.
*   **Supporting Quotes:** The paper uses quotes from Sontag, Baldwin, and other theorists. Make sure each quote is effectively integrated into your argument and that you explain *why* the quote is relevant to your point.
*   **Robert Brustein's review:** You mention the "scathing review" by Brustein. It would be helpful to summarize the main points of his critique and explain how his perspective challenges or supports your own.

**4. Structure and Organization:**

*   **Logical Flow:** The paper generally follows a logical progression, but some sections could be more tightly structured. Consider using topic sentences to clearly signal the main point of each paragraph.
*   **Transitions:** Strengthen the transitions between paragraphs and sections. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and show the reader how your argument is developing.

**5. Engagement with Scholarship:**

*   **Critical Engagement:** While you cite relevant scholarship, you could be more critical in your engagement with it. For example, you mention Livingston's more positive view of Avedon's work. How does her interpretation differ from your own, and why do you find your perspective more compelling?
*   **Expanding the Scope:** Consider exploring additional perspectives on the ethics of photographing vulnerable populations. Are there other ethical frameworks or codes of conduct that could be relevant to your analysis?

**6. Writing Style and Mechanics:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** In some places, the writing could be more concise and direct. Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly complex sentence structures.
*   **Proofreading:** Carefully proofread the paper for any grammatical errors, typos, or stylistic inconsistencies.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Start with a compelling "hook" to grab the reader's attention.
    *   Clearly state your thesis statement.
    *   Briefly outline the main points you will be discussing in the paper.

*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that relates to your thesis.
    *   Provide specific examples from the photographs or Baldwin's text to support your claims.
    *   Explain the significance of each example and how it contributes to your overall argument.
    *   Engage critically with relevant scholarship.
    *   Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and ensure a smooth flow.

*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize your main points and restate your thesis in a new way.
    *   Discuss the broader implications of your analysis.
    *   End with a thought-provoking final statement.

**Areas of Strength:**

*   The introduction of Avedon's sister Louise into the discussion adds a layer of personal complexity to the ethical consideration of the project.
*   You are thoughtful and nuanced in considering the issues of vulnerability and agency in relation to the subjects of Avedon's photographs.
*   You bring in important theoretical frameworks from Sontag, Brecht, and Sekula.

By focusing on these areas for improvement, you can create a more compelling and persuasive analysis of Avedon's work. I hope this feedback is helpful!
