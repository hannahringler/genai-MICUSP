Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on clarity, structure, technical correctness, and areas for improvement.

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The paper addresses all the required tasks of the project, comparing simulation results with experimental data from Vogel and Eaton.
*   **Technical Depth:** The paper discusses important concepts in CFD, such as mesh independence, turbulence modeling (k-epsilon), wall functions, and the significance of the Stanton number and skin-friction coefficient.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper generally follows a logical structure: introduction, mesh generation (Gambit), mesh independence study, Fluent setup, results and discussion for each task, and a conclusion.
*   **Equations:** You did a good job including and labeling the equations used.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarity and Specificity:**

    *   **Introduction:**  Be more specific about the project's objectives. What is the goal of simulating the flow over a backward-facing step? Why is it important to study this flow?  Mentioning applications of this flow (heat exchangers, etc.) can improve this.
    *   **Grid Independence:** While you mention doubling the resolution, quantify the change in the number of cells.  "Doubling the resolution" is vague. How many cells in each mesh?
    *   **Wall Functions:**  Explain *why* the realizable k-epsilon model with non-equilibrium wall functions is expected to perform best. Give a brief reason for the choice.
    *   **Equation Explanation:** Expand on the explanation of the variables in Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Briefly define each variable when you first introduce the equation. For example: "Re = U\*L/k where Re is the Reynolds number, U is the... L is the... and k is the..."
    *   **Boundary Layer Thickness:**  Elaborate on why you need to calculate the boundary layer thickness.  What is this used for within the analysis?
    *   **Turbulence Intensity:**  You mention a turbulence intensity of 0.5. Is this a typo? A turbulence intensity of 0.5 (or 50%) would indicate a highly turbulent flow. If this is the correct value given in the project, mention the high turbulence intensity.
    *   **Justify Insulated Walls:** You assumed the rest of the walls to be insulated. While you mention this being specified in the project, justify *why* the walls would be insulated.

2.  **Results and Discussion:**

    *   **Table 1 (Reattachment Length):**  The format and layout of this is difficult to understand. It's hard to read and cluttered. Is there a way to restructure the presentation to make the data easier to read and understand? Consider using only significant digits.
    *   **Figure Discussion:** Spend more time *discussing* the figures. For example:
        *   *Stanton Number:*  "Figure 4 shows the Stanton number profiles... The realizable k-epsilon model with non-equilibrium wall functions predicts a Stanton number [higher/lower] than the other models. This is likely due to [explain why]. These results are consistent with the observations in Vogel and Eaton, which found that..."  Compare values quantitatively.  Which model gives the best match to the experimental data? How does the reattachment point location affect the Stanton number? What is the physical reasoning for the behavior of the Stanton number?
        *   *Skin-Friction Coefficient:* "Figure 6 shows that the skin-friction coefficient goes to zero at approximately x/XR = 1, indicating flow reattachment. The negative values before x/XR=1 represent the backflow region..."  Quantitatively compare the results. Mention ranges of values from Vogel and Eaton.
        *   *Velocity Profiles:*  Compare the calculated velocity profiles to the profiles shown by Vogel and Eaton. Address any key differences. Comment on the accuracy of the near-wall treatment.
        *   *Turbulence Intensity Profiles:* Explain the shape of the streamwise turbulence intensity profiles. Is the location of peak turbulence intensity consistent across the different models?
        *   *Temperature Profiles:* Comment on how the temperature distributions vary with respect to the reattachment point.

3.  **Technical Correctness and Justification:**

    *   **Hydraulic Diameter:** Check the units. Does the result really have units of meters?  Make sure the units align. Also, explain why calculating the hydraulic diameter is important.
    *   **Boundary Layer Thickness Calculation:** Provide context on why you need to find the boundary layer thickness. What is this calculation used for?
    *   **Units:** Use consistent units throughout the paper (SI units are preferred).
    *    **Explain CFD Models:** For readers who might be unfamiliar, provide a brief explanation of what the differences are between the standard, RNG, and realizable k-epsilon models.

4.  **Figures:**

    *   **Axis Labels:** Ensure all figures have clear and complete axis labels, including units (if applicable).
    *   **Captions:** The figure captions could be more descriptive.  Instead of just "Figure 4: Stanton number profiles...", say "Figure 4: Comparison of Stanton number profiles for all 6 turbulence models at Re = 8.96E5, showing the variation with non-dimensional distance from the step."
    *   **Quality:** Some figures (especially 7, 8, 9, 10) are grainy and not very clear. If possible, regenerate these figures at a higher resolution or use vector graphics.  Improve image resolution.
    *   **Placement:** The placement and spacing of some images need improvement.

5.  **Conclusion:**

    *   **Summarize Key Findings:** The conclusion could be more specific. Instead of just saying the results "closely match" Vogel and Eaton, give concrete examples of how closely they match.
    *   **Limitations and Future Work:** Briefly mention any limitations of your study (e.g., the 2D assumption, the choice of turbulence model) and suggest potential areas for future research (e.g., 3D simulations, different turbulence models).

**Specific Line-by-Line Comments:**

*   **Abstract (If Required):** Although not present, a concise abstract summarizing the project, methods, and key findings would be beneficial.
*   **Introduction, Paragraph 1:** The sentence, "We created two different meshes, shown in figures 2 and 3 below, to check for grid independence," is better stated as: "To check for grid independence, two different meshes were created and are shown in Figures 2 and 3."
*   **Page 3, Paragraph 1:** "In doing mesh independence, we kept the location of the first grid point the same and doubled the nodes on the horizontal walls". Change to something like: "In doing mesh independence, the y+ value for the first grid point was kept the same and the number of nodes on the horizontal walls was doubled."

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Review Vogel and Eaton Carefully:** Make sure you thoroughly understand the experimental setup and results of the Vogel and Eaton paper. This will help you make more meaningful comparisons.
*   **Consult CFD Textbooks/Resources:** Refer to reputable CFD textbooks and resources to deepen your understanding of turbulence modeling, wall functions, and other related concepts.
*   **Iterate and Refine:** CFD simulations often involve an iterative process of refining the mesh, adjusting the solver settings, and validating the results. Be prepared to experiment and make adjustments as needed.

By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of your paper. Good luck!
