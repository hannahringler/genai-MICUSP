Okay, I've read your paper and can give you some feedback. Overall, it's a well-researched and thoughtful piece engaging with complex concepts of solidarity, identity politics, and historical race relations within feminism. You grapple effectively with Dean's concept of reflective solidarity and its limitations, and bring in other theorists to strengthen your analysis. However, there are some areas where you could refine your arguments and improve clarity.

Here's a breakdown of my feedback:

**Strengths:**

*   **Complex Argumentation:** You're dealing with very intricate theoretical ideas and historical situations, and you're able to bring them together in a meaningful way. You clearly understand the nuances of the theorists you're engaging with.
*   **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** You demonstrate a solid understanding of Dean, Mohanty, Brah, and Benhabib and use their concepts effectively to analyze the historical context of the Combahee River Collective and Bread and Roses.
*   **Critical Engagement:** You don't just accept Dean's theory at face value. You identify its weaknesses and limitations, especially its insufficient attention to power dynamics and historical context.
*   **Historical Awareness:** You demonstrate a good grasp of the historical context of second-wave feminism and the racial tensions within it. Your understanding of the Combahee River Collective's specific concerns and experiences is evident.
*   **Clear Structure (Mostly):** The overall argument flows logically, starting with an introduction to the key concepts and then moving into a critical analysis. The use of subheadings helps to organize the paper.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** At times, the writing can be dense and difficult to follow. This is especially true in sections where you're explaining theoretical concepts. Try to break down complex ideas into simpler sentences and use more concrete examples.  Consider if every sentence is serving a purpose in forwarding your argument. Aim for clarity and conciseness to strengthen the impact of your arguments.
*   **Strengthen the Thesis:** While the introduction sets up the problem, the specific claim could be more focused. Consider sharpening the thesis statement to explicitly state *how* Dean and Breines fail to adequately capture the historical juncture and *what* specific elements of Mohanty and Brah's theories would provide a more tenable approach.
*   **Balance Theory and Historical Context:** While you do a good job of introducing theoretical concepts, sometimes the link between the theory and the specific historical context of the CRC and Bread and Roses could be stronger. In other words, make sure you explicitly *show* how the theoretical concepts help us understand the *specific* problems and tensions in the historical situation. Ground the theoretical discussion more concretely in the historical realities.
*   **Develop the Alternative:** You mention Mohanty and Brah as offering a "tenable alternative" but don't fully develop *how* their concepts would resolve the issues you identify with Dean. Spend more time fleshing out their approaches and explaining how they would lead to a more nuanced understanding of solidarity. This is crucial to demonstrate the value of your critique.
*   **Address Counterarguments:** Consider addressing potential counterarguments to your claims. For example, someone might argue that Dean's theory is meant to be a *general* framework and not necessarily a *specific* historical analysis. Addressing these counterarguments will strengthen your overall argument.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion could be strengthened by summarizing your main points and offering a more definitive statement about the implications of your analysis. How should we think about solidarity differently in light of your critique? What are the practical implications of adopting a Mohanty/Brah-informed approach?

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   "Is the reconciliation Breines proposes a viable one for black feminists, and what kind of solidarity is required for this to be tenable?"  This question is good, but perhaps sharpen it into a specific claim about Breines's limitations.
    *   Consider adding a sentence outlining the structure of the essay.
*   **Theoretical Explanations:**
    *   When introducing Dean's concepts, provide clear and concise definitions. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it immediately. For example, when you introduce "affectional," "conventional," and "reflective" solidarity, consider adding a very brief parenthetical explanation to each.
    *   When discussing the "situated, hypothetical third," provide a clearer example to illustrate the concept.
*   **Historical Analysis:**
    *   You mention the murder of twelve black women as a catalyzing event for the CRC. Expand on this a bit and explain *how* this event highlighted the specific concerns of black feminists and the limitations of existing movements.
    *   When discussing Bread and Roses' attendance at Black Panther rallies, elaborate on the complexities of the Black Panther movement for black women. This will further illustrate the challenges of achieving solidarity.
*   **Developing the Alternative (Mohanty/Brah):**
    *   Devote a dedicated section to elaborating on Mohanty's "common context of struggle" and Brah's ideas about political mobilization through differentiation. Explain *how* these concepts address the shortcomings of Dean's theory.
    *   Provide concrete examples of how Mohanty and Brah's approaches would lead to a more nuanced and effective form of solidarity in the context of the CRC and Bread and Roses.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize your main arguments about the limitations of Dean and Breines and the potential of Mohanty and Brah.
    *   Offer a final statement about the implications of your analysis for contemporary discussions of solidarity and social justice. What lessons can we learn from the historical experiences of the CRC and Bread and Roses?

**Style and Grammar:**

*   Carefully proofread for any typos or grammatical errors.
*   Vary sentence structure to improve readability.
*   Ensure consistent use of citations.

By addressing these points, you can make your paper even stronger and more persuasive. You have a solid foundation, and with some targeted revisions, you can create a truly exceptional piece of scholarship. Let me know if you have any other questions.
