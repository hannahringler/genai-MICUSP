Okay, I can provide feedback on the paper you've submitted. Here's a breakdown of my assessment, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper is a well-structured argumentative essay that critiques Eric Olin Wright's analysis of poverty. You demonstrate a good understanding of Wright's argument and engage with it thoughtfully. The writing is generally clear and coherent, and the organization is logical. The "Reflection" section adds a personal touch and acknowledges the potential biases in your own perspective.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis statement clearly states your position: that Wright's analysis of poverty is plausible, but his assumption that the problem can be solved while maintaining American capitalism is flawed.
*   **Accurate Summary:** You provide a comprehensive and accurate summary of Wright's argument, including the four popular arguments in poverty discourse and the shmoo example.
*   **Logical Organization:** The essay follows a logical structure: introduction with thesis, summary of Wright's argument, your critique, and a conclusion.
*   **Engaging with Evidence:** You use Wright's work and other sources (Tocqueville, Williams, Hazlitt) to support your claims and counterarguments.
*   **Counterarguments:** You effectively present counterarguments to Wright's position, highlighting the potential downsides of higher minimum wages and the importance of individual responsibility and skills.
*   **Strong Writing:** The writing is generally clear, concise, and well-organized.
*   **Reflection:** The inclusion of the "Reflection" section is a strength, showing self-awareness and critical thinking about your own biases.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Depth of Critique:** While you raise valid points against Wright, the critique could be deepened. For instance, you could elaborate on why social programs are more effective than higher minimum wages, providing specific examples or data to support your claims.
*   **Addressing Root Causes:** You mention skills and education, but the essay doesn't fully explore the root causes of the lack of skills and education among the poor. How can these systemic issues be addressed?
*   **Nuance:** The critique could benefit from more nuance. While you argue against Wright's proposed solutions, you don't fully offer your own comprehensive solution. You touch on social programs, but a more detailed vision would strengthen the essay.
*   **Overgeneralizations:** Some statements could be more precise. For example, saying "Americans' consumerist, self-interested ideals will drastically change" is a strong claim that needs more evidence.
*   **Source Integration:** While you cite sources, you could integrate them more seamlessly into your arguments. For example, when quoting Williams and Hazlitt, explain more explicitly how their points directly challenge Wright's claims.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Elaborate on Social Programs:** Expand on the types of social programs that would be most effective in lifting people out of poverty. How would these programs address the "culture of poverty" and promote individual responsibility? Be specific.
2.  **Discuss Systemic Issues:** Address the systemic issues that contribute to poverty, such as unequal access to education, healthcare, and opportunities. How can these inequalities be reduced?
3.  **Strengthen Counterarguments:** Provide more evidence and data to support your counterarguments. For example, cite studies that show the impact of minimum wage increases on employment.
4.  **Offer a More Comprehensive Solution:** Develop a more detailed vision for addressing poverty that goes beyond simply advocating for social programs. Consider a multi-faceted approach that combines individual responsibility, government support, and private sector initiatives.
5.  **Refine Language:** Be careful with generalizations. Instead of saying "Americans believe...", consider phrasing it as "Many Americans believe..." or "Studies have shown that..."
6.  **Connect Sources More Explicitly:** When using quotes or paraphrases, clearly explain how the source's argument supports your point and contradicts Wright's.

**Specific Comments**

*   **Thesis:** Good, but could be even stronger by hinting at your proposed solution.
*   **Summary of Wright:** Excellent. Clear and accurate.
*   **Use of Shmoo:** Good explanation.
*   **Evaluation:** This section is good, but needs more depth.

**In Summary**

You've written a solid argumentative essay that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and your ability to engage with complex ideas. By addressing the weaknesses and implementing the suggestions for improvement, you can elevate this paper to an even higher level.
