Okay, here's some feedback on your paper.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a coherent argument about Augustine's view of desire and its connection to free will, sin, and salvation, based on his work "Confessions". You are explaining a complex concept in a fairly clear manner. The writing is academic and generally well-organized. The argument is well-supported by quotes from the primary text.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The paper identifies the importance of "desire" in Augustine's "Confessions" and how it is analyzed by him, providing a roadmap for the argument.
*   **Strong Use of Primary Source:** You effectively integrate quotes from "The Confessions" to support your claims and to illustrate Augustine's perspective. You reference it appropriately.
*   **Coherent Argument:** The paper moves logically from defining desire to discussing free will, sin, and the remedy of turning to Christ. Each point builds upon the previous one.
*   **Academic Tone:** The writing is formal and appropriate for a college-level essay.
*   **Understanding of Augustine:** You demonstrate a solid grasp of Augustine's key concepts (e.g., the nature of time, the goodness of creation, the role of free will, the significance of Christ).

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Analysis:** While you present Augustine's ideas, try to dig deeper into *why* he holds these beliefs and how they relate to his personal experience. For example, you could discuss the historical and cultural context in which Augustine was writing, or explore potential counterarguments to his views. Think about "so what"
*   **Vary Sentence Structure:** While the prose is academic, the sentence structure can be a bit repetitive at times. Varying the sentence length and structure can improve readability and make the argument more engaging.
*   **Word Choice:** Occasional word choice could be improved for greater precision.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Consider a broader opening sentence to immediately capture the reader's attention. You could begin with a more general statement about the nature of desire itself, before focusing on Augustine.
    *   Could add a thesis statement.
*   **Clarity:**

    *   In your first paragraph, clarify what is meant by 'common desires' of individuals. A few examples could make it more concrete.
*   **Paragraphing:**
    *   Check your paragraph breaks. Sometimes, ideas that belong together are separated into different paragraphs. For instance, the sentence beginning "In Augustine's first book of The Confessionsâ€¦" might flow better if it were joined to the preceding paragraph, as it further elaborates on the significance of desire in Augustine's work.

**Example Revisions:**

*   **Original:** "The desires of the world and society around Augustine had become one that produced temporary satisfaction. It is critical to establish what the common desires of individuals are because it represents what society a whole values most."
*   **Revised:** "The desires of the world during Augustine's time, centered on temporary earthly pleasures, led to dissatisfaction. Understanding these common desires - wealth, fame, sensual gratification - reveals the values that defined that society."

**In Summary:**

You have a solid foundation here. By adding more in-depth analysis, refining your sentence structure, and carefully proofreading, you can elevate this paper to an even higher level. Keep up the good work!
