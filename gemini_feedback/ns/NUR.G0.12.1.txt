Okay, I've reviewed the paper. Here's a breakdown of feedback, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a reasonably clear outline of a diabetes prevention project targeted at high school students. It covers relevant background information, identifies a target population, proposes an intervention, and discusses evaluation. However, it's a bit thin on details in several areas and could benefit from more concrete and specific planning.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Identification of the Problem:** The paper clearly identifies diabetes (specifically Type I and Type II) as a health issue relevant to adolescents.
*   **Target Population Defined:** The target population (high school students in a specific school) is well-defined, including some demographic data.
*   **Relevant Resources Mentioned:** The paper mentions resources available to the target population, such as the school nurse and local health systems.
*   **Realistic Intervention:** The educational poster is a practical and relatively low-cost intervention for the setting.
*   **Discussion of Evaluation:** The paper acknowledges the importance of evaluation and discusses both qualitative and quantitative methods.
*   **References Included:** The paper includes a list of references, indicating research was conducted.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Specificity:**
    *   The poster content itself is not described in detail. What specific information about symptoms, hypo/hyperglycemia, resources, and exercise will be included?  An example of the proposed content would be very helpful.
    *   The evaluation methods are vague.  "Keeping a count of how many information sheets are taken" is a very weak evaluation method.
    *   The goals are somewhat generic.
*   **Weak Evaluation Plan:** The proposed evaluation relies heavily on word-of-mouth and the number of sheets taken, which are not robust or reliable measures of impact.  There's no plan for assessing changes in knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors.
*   **Limited Scope:** While the poster is a good starting point, it's a passive intervention.  It relies on students to actively seek information.
*   **Missing Theoretical Framework:** The paper lacks a theoretical framework to guide the intervention.  Using a health behavior theory (e.g., Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Planned Behavior) would strengthen the rationale and design of the project.
*   **Missing Literature Review:** The introduction includes a good overview, but it is missing information that helps contextualize the rationale behind choosing this school in particular.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Develop Specific, Measurable Objectives:**

    *   Instead of "helping students understand the symptoms of diabetes," create objectives like "After viewing the poster, 70% of students will be able to identify at least three common symptoms of Type II diabetes."
    *   Instead of "raise their feelings of compassion," consider a goal like "increase the number of students who voluntarily participate in diabetes awareness activities."
2.  **Design a More Robust Evaluation Plan:**

    *   **Pre- and Post-Tests:** Administer a brief, anonymous pre-test to assess baseline knowledge and attitudes about diabetes.  Give the same test as a post-test after the poster has been displayed for a month.
    *   **Surveys:** Use a short, anonymous survey to assess students' perceptions of the poster's effectiveness, its clarity, and its impact on their knowledge and attitudes.
    *   **Focus Groups:** Conduct small focus groups with students to gather more in-depth qualitative feedback about the poster and their understanding of diabetes.

3.  **Enhance the Intervention:**

    *   **Active Components:** Consider adding an active component to the intervention.  For example:
        *   A short presentation by the school nurse during health class.
        *   A peer education program where trained students provide information about diabetes to their classmates.
        *   A school-wide health fair with information about diabetes prevention.
    *   **Incorporate Visuals:**  As the paper mentions, include more engaging visuals on the poster (photos, illustrations, infographics).

4.  **Incorporate a Theoretical Framework:**

    *   **Choose a relevant health behavior theory:** Research the Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory, or Theory of Planned Behavior.  Select the theory that best explains how people make decisions about their health and use it to guide the design of your intervention and evaluation.
    *   **Explain the theory in the paper:** Briefly describe the chosen theory and how it relates to your project.  For example, explain how your intervention addresses the key constructs of the theory (e.g., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, self-efficacy).

5.  **Expand the Literature Review:**

    *   **Look for studies that have evaluated similar interventions in high schools.** What were the results? What worked well? What were the challenges?
    *   **Research the prevalence of diabetes in the specific county or region where the high school is located.** This will help you justify the need for your project.
    *   **Gather more data on the specific school population.**  Are there any existing health data available from the school nurse or the school district?

6.  **Provide More Detail about the Poster Content:**

    *   Describe the specific topics that will be covered on the poster (e.g., risk factors for Type II diabetes, healthy eating habits, the importance of physical activity, resources for getting help).
    *   Outline the key messages that you want students to take away from the poster.

**Specific Comments/Suggestions:**

*   **Assessment Section:**
    *   When citing statistics about diabetes prevalence, include both national and, if possible, local (county or state) data to highlight the relevance to the specific population.
    *   Briefly mention the long-term consequences of uncontrolled diabetes to emphasize the importance of prevention.
*   **Intervention Objectives Section:**
    *   Consider adding an objective related to promoting early detection of diabetes.
*   **Plan for Implementation and Evaluation Section:**
    *   Be more specific about how you will obtain permission to display the poster.
    *   Clarify how you will ensure that the information sheets are easily accessible to students.
    *   Discuss how you will protect the privacy of students who participate in the evaluation.
*   **Evaluation Section:**
    *   Expand on the limitations of the chosen evaluation method. What are the potential sources of bias? How might these limitations affect the interpretation of the results?
    *   Discuss alternative evaluation methods that could be used in future projects.
*   **References:** Double-check that all references are formatted consistently and accurately.

**In Summary**

This paper presents a good starting point for a diabetes prevention project. By incorporating these suggestions, you can strengthen the project's design, increase its potential impact, and create a more compelling proposal. Good luck!
