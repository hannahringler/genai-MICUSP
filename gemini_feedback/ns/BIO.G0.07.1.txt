Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can provide some feedback. Here's a breakdown of strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper addresses the topic of complementation in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and attempts to analyze experimental results. However, it needs significant improvements in clarity, organization, and interpretation of data. The writing style is somewhat convoluted, and the connection between observations and conclusions isn't always clear.

**Strengths:**

*   **Addresses the topic:** The paper tackles the core concepts of complementation, intergenic vs. intragenic complementation, and its application to histidine biosynthesis in yeast.
*   **Includes a results section:** The paper attempts to present the experimental results.
*   **Includes a reference:** Includes a properly cited laboratory manual.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The writing is often dense and difficult to follow. Sentences are sometimes too long and complex. Word choice can be improved for clarity.
*   **Organization:** The structure is somewhat disjointed. The flow of information isn't always logical.
*   **Data Interpretation:** The connection between the observed growth patterns and the conclusions about gene mutations and reversion is weak. The reasoning isn't always clearly explained.
*   **Lack of Specificity:** There's a lack of specific detail in describing the experimental setup and the strains used.
*   **Lack of Error Analysis:** The discussion section often invokes error or unexpected results, yet, there is no systematic description of potential errors in the experiment.
*   **Minor Issues:**
    *   Incomplete sentences: the last sentence in the paper does not finish its thought.
    *   There is a reference to a Table 2 but Table 2 is in the Results section.
    *   Formatting issues: for example, the minimal + histidine plates are on top of each other instead of horizontally.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

**1. Introduction:**

*   **Be more concise:** Streamline the language. For example, instead of "Complementation experiments test for function," try "Complementation experiments determine if two mutations affect the same gene."
*   **Clearer Explanation:** Make sure the purpose of complementation assays is explicitly stated. What information do they provide? Why are they useful?
*   **Provide Context:** Briefly introduce the histidine biosynthesis pathway. Why is it a good system to study complementation?
*   **State the Objective:** Clearly state the specific goal of *this* experiment. What question are you trying to answer?

**2. Materials and Methods:**

*   **Elaborate Slightly:** While referencing the lab manual is acceptable, briefly mention key aspects of the procedure that are relevant to understanding the results. For example, the type of media used, the temperature of incubation, the method of mating.
*   **Strain Information:** Provide more details about the *A* and *a* strains beyond just the table. Where do these mutations come from? What are the specific alleles?
*   **Justify Control Plate:** Clearly explain the purpose of the minimal plus histidine control plate. What does it control for? What would you expect to see on this plate if everything worked correctly?

**3. Results:**

*   **Be More Organized:** Start with a broad overview of the results and then go into specific details.
*   **Quantify (If Possible):** Instead of just saying "growth was evident," try to quantify the growth (e.g., "sparse colonies," "moderate growth," "confluent growth").
*   **Clarify Terminology:** Define what you mean by "confluent lines of growth." Is this the same as "confluent growth"?
*   **Address Discrepancies Early:** If there are results that deviate from expectations, acknowledge them explicitly in the results section. Don't wait until the discussion.
*   **Table 1 Feedback:** Clarify that his1 is auxotrophic for histidine.

**4. Discussion:**

*   **Stronger Data Interpretation:** This is the most critical area for improvement. For each non-complementing pair, explain *why* that result leads you to conclude that the mutations are in the same gene.
*   **Address Unexpected Results Systematically:** Don't just suggest contamination or reversion as a catch-all explanation.
    *   *Contamination:* If you suspect contamination, explain how it might have occurred and what specific results are consistent with contamination. Is there a way to test this hypothesis?
    *   *Reversion:* Explain why reversion is a plausible explanation. How frequently would you expect reversion to occur? Are there other ways to explain the small colonies?
*   **Be Specific About Mutations:** When you conclude that a mutation is in a particular gene, specify the *allele* (if known).
*   **Error Analysis:** Discuss possible sources of error in the experiment (e.g., contamination, inaccurate dilutions, mislabeling of strains). How could these errors have affected the results?
*   **Limitations of the Experiment:** Acknowledge the limitations of the experiment. What questions remain unanswered? What further experiments could be done to clarify the results?

**5. Summary:**

*   **Be More Specific:** Instead of "Intergenic and intragenic complementation was observed," summarize the *specific* intergenic and intragenic complementation events that were observed (or inferred). Briefly state your key findings.

**General Writing Tips:**

*   **Use Active Voice:** Instead of "Growth was present," try "The cells grew."
*   **Avoid Ambiguity:** Make sure each sentence has a clear and unambiguous meaning.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Check for typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies in formatting.

**Example of Improvement (Data Interpretation):**

**Original:** "Using this logic, the a4 strain did not complement with A6 indicating that it has a mutation in the *his1* gene, Table 2."

**Improved:** "The *a4* strain failed to complement the *A6* strain on minimal medium, indicating that *a4* and *A6* have mutations in the same gene. Because *A6* is known to have a mutation in the *his1* gene, we conclude that *a4* also carries a mutation in *his1*."

By addressing these weaknesses and implementing the suggestions, you can significantly improve the clarity, accuracy, and impact of your paper. Good luck!
