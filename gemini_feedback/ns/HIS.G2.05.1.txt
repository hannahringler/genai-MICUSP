Okay, I've reviewed the paper you provided the OCR for, and here's my feedback, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions.

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a well-defined argument about the interplay of otherness and Englishness in late medieval pilgrimage guides. It displays a strong grasp of the historical context and engages effectively with relevant scholarly literature. The analysis of the primary sources is generally insightful. The paper's organization is logical, and the writing is clear and articulate.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Argument:** The paper establishes a central argument early on and consistently returns to it throughout the analysis. The thesis that these guides are not just practical but also construct a specifically "English" pilgrimage experience is compelling.

*   **Solid Research:** The paper demonstrates familiarity with a good range of primary and secondary sources. The references are accurate and well-integrated.

*   **Effective Use of Primary Sources:** The analysis of the pilgrimage guides is generally strong, and the paper successfully extracts relevant details to support its claims. The inclusion of quotes really helps the reader understand your analysis.

*   **Good Organization:** The paper follows a logical structure, with clear transitions between sections.

*   **Engaging Writing:** The writing is clear and accessible, and the introduction effectively draws the reader in.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the analysis is generally strong, there are instances where it could benefit from greater depth. For example, in the discussion of the role of the Jews and the Saracens, the paper might explore more fully the nuances of the attitudes expressed in the guides and how these attitudes relate to broader social and political contexts.

*   **Connecting to Broader Trends:** The paper mentions the broader trends of late medieval religious practice and English identity, but it could strengthen the analysis by explicitly connecting the specific details of the pilgrimage guides to these larger developments. For example, how do the anxieties expressed in the guides relate to specific events or controversies of the time?

*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While the paper makes a compelling case for the construction of Englishness, it is important to acknowledge the complexity and potential contradictions within the sources. Are there instances where the guides express more cosmopolitan or inclusive views? Are there differences in how Englishness is constructed across the different guides?

*   **Map Analysis:** The inclusion of the map is interesting, but the analysis could be more fully integrated into the overall argument. How does the map contribute to the construction of English identity or the imagined pilgrimage experience?

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Expand on the Role of the Saracens/Muslims:** You mention that the hostility to muslims is expressed in standardized ways, but what are those ways? and what is the significance of this? Is it meant to warn readers about what to expect on their journey?

*   **Elaborate on Food Choices:** You mention that food choices tie into national identity, how can that be expanded upon? Are there particular foods that were seen as English? And how does that contrast to the foods that they were eating on their pilgrimage?

*   **Connect to Modern Scholarship:** You mention Helfers but there could be more engagement to other modern scholarship as well.

**Overall Recommendation**

This is a very good paper that demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and a capacity for insightful analysis. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, you can further strengthen the argument and produce an even more compelling and nuanced piece of scholarship.

I hope this feedback is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
