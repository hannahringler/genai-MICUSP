Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on argumentation, clarity, use of evidence, and overall structure.

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a strong, focused argument about the diminished role of Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the Gospels of Matthew and John.  The core thesis is clear and consistent throughout.  The paper is well-organized and generally well-written. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened and refined.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis statement (that Mary's role is discredited in both Gospels, with no voice or authority) is clearly stated and consistently maintained.
*   **Focused Argument:** The paper stays focused on the central argument, providing evidence and analysis to support the claim that Mary's role is minimized.
*   **Use of Textual Evidence:** The paper effectively uses direct quotations from Matthew and John to support its claims.
*   **Organized Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, comparing and contrasting Mary's portrayal in the two Gospels.
*   **Thought-provoking interpretations**: The author brings up interesting angles, particularly concerning Mary's potential lack of consent in Matthew and the interpretation of "Woman" in John.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Nuance and Qualification:**
    *   While the argument for the diminished role is strong, the paper might benefit from acknowledging any nuances or complexities in the portrayal of Mary. Are there *any* aspects where she is presented positively or with some agency, even if limited? Addressing potential counterarguments strengthens the overall argument.
    *   Avoid overly strong language. For example, the phrase "divine rape" is very strong and might be softened to something like "a non-consensual impregnation."

2.  **Depth of Analysis:**
    *   While the paper uses textual evidence well, sometimes the analysis could be deeper. Instead of simply quoting a passage and stating its implications, try to delve into *why* the author might have chosen to portray Mary in a certain way. What were the potential theological or social implications of minimizing her role?
    *   For instance, when discussing the "Woman" passage, the paper could explore the historical and cultural context of the term and consider alternative interpretations that might challenge the reading of disrespect.

3.  **Addressing Counterarguments:**
    *   The paper could be strengthened by directly addressing potential counterarguments. For instance, some might argue that Mary's role in the Annunciation (even if passively portrayed) is significant, or that her presence at the foot of the cross demonstrates her enduring importance. Addressing these counterclaims and explaining why they are ultimately less persuasive would enhance the argument's credibility.

4.  **Clarity and Specificity:**
    *   In a few places, the writing could be more precise. For example, "Although there are differences in how she is presented in Matthew and John..." could be expanded upon to specifically state what those key differences are.
    *   When making claims about the reader's interpretation (e.g., "This gives the reader the impression..."), provide more justification for why the reader would draw that conclusion.

5.  **Balanced Comparison:**
    *   The paper spends more time analyzing Matthew than John. While this is not necessarily a flaw, consider whether the argument would be more balanced if both Gospels received more equal attention.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Page 1:**
    *   Consider rephrasing "victim of divine rape." This is a very provocative term and could be perceived as sensationalist. Perhaps "Mary can be viewed as lacking agency in her divine selection" or something similar.
    *   Expand on the significance of Joseph receiving the message first. What does this prioritization of male knowledge imply?
*   **Page 2:**
    *   Clarify the connection between the different interpretations of "virgin" and the argument about Mary's role. How does each interpretation (or lack thereof) further diminish her agency or importance?
*   **Page 3:**
    *   Explain *why* the emphasis on Jesus's divinity in John necessarily diminishes Mary's role. Is it simply a matter of competition, or are there deeper theological implications?
    *   Discuss why being referred to as "the mother of Jesus" is inherently discrediting.
*   **Page 4:**
    *   Explore alternative interpretations of Jesus's response in John 2:4. Was he being disrespectful, or was he setting boundaries or asserting his divine mission?

**In conclusion:**

This is a solid argumentative essay with a clear thesis and strong use of textual evidence. By adding more nuance, addressing counterarguments, and deepening the analysis, the paper can be elevated to an even higher level.
