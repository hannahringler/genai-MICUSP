Okay, I've read the paper and here's my feedback. This feedback focuses on the content, structure, and clarity of the writing, assuming it is a review of a research article.

**Overall Impression**

The paper provides a decent summary and evaluation of the Perkonigg et al. (2005) study on the longitudinal course of PTSD. It identifies key aspects of the study design, findings, and implications. However, it could be strengthened by more critical analysis and a more sophisticated understanding of research methodology.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Summary:** The paper accurately summarizes the study's purpose, methods, and main findings. The explanation of how PTSD status was determined is helpful.
*   **Identification of Key Findings:** The paper correctly highlights the persistence of PTSD symptoms, the remission rates, and the impact of new traumas.
*   **Importance of the Study:** The paper correctly points out the importance of understanding PTSD as a chronic disorder and identifying risk factors for its persistence.
*   **Clear Writing:** The writing is generally clear and easy to understand.

**Areas for Improvement**

1.  **Deeper Critical Analysis:**
    *   **Limitations:** The paper mentions that it would have been helpful to know why some participants dropped out, and that this might affect the study results. This point could be more developed. What specific biases might attrition introduce? Are there other limitations to the study design (e.g., reliance on self-report, specific population studied, etc.) that could be discussed?
    *   **Strengths:** While the paper identifies the importance of the study it does not specify the strengths.
    *   **Generalizability:** How well do the findings generalize to other populations or settings? Are there cultural considerations that might limit the applicability of the results?
    *   **Comparison to Other Research:** Are there other studies that support or contradict these findings? Briefly comparing and contrasting the study with other relevant research would strengthen the analysis.
2.  **Methodological Understanding:**
    *   **More Detail on Methods:** You mentioned, *“The authors did not discuss who carried out these interviews with participants”*. This is a very important factor as the qualification of the interviewer can greatly influence the validity of results.
    *   **More Detail on methods:** Expand on the methods used, in particular the details of the diagnostic measure.
3.  **Structure and Organization:**
    *   **Introduction:** A brief introductory paragraph that sets the context for the study and states the purpose of the review would be helpful. The purpose is to summarize and critically evaluate, so introduce that.
    *   **Logical Flow:** While generally well-organized, consider a more structured approach:
        *   Brief introduction of the study.
        *   Detailed summary of methods.
        *   Summary of the results.
        *   Discussion of the strengths of the study.
        *   Discussion of limitations of the study.
        *   Implications for research or practice.
        *   Conclusion.
4.  **Specificity and Examples:**
    *   **Avoid Vague Statements:** Some statements are a bit general. For example, "Additional results showed that the participants with chronic PTSD had higher rates of mental illnesses at follow-up including, somatoform and anxiety disorders." Be more specific: What *types* of somatoform and anxiety disorders? What were the relative risks or odds ratios?
    *   **Examples:** Whenever possible, use concrete examples from the study to illustrate your points.

**Specific Suggestions/Edits**

*   **"In a prospective-longitudinal study conducted by Perkonigg, Pfister, Stein, et al. (2005) they assessed..."** Redundant to say "they assessed." Just say "Perkonigg, Pfister, Stein, et al. (2005) assessed..."
*   **"The PTSD data used in this research were drawn from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study conducted in Germany."** This could be phrased more clearly: "The data for this study were drawn from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study, a large-scale investigation conducted in Germany."
*   **"This study had a high response for both follow-up times."** Quantify this with the percentages already provided. "This study had a high response rate at both follow-up points: 88% at the first and 84% at the second."

**Overall Grade Estimation**

Based on the current state of the paper, I would estimate a grade in the B to B+ range. Addressing the points above, particularly the deeper critical analysis and methodological understanding, could raise it to an A- or A.

**In summary, the paper provides a good starting point but needs more critical analysis, methodological detail, and a stronger structure to reach its full potential.**
