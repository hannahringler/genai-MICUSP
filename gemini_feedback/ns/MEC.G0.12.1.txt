Okay, here's some feedback on the paper "Attitude Control Algorithms Selection," focusing on clarity, technical depth, and overall presentation:

**Overall Impressions**

*   **Good Start:** The paper provides a decent overview of attitude control for CubeSats using magnetic torquers. It covers essential concepts like attitude determination, control actuators, and common control algorithms.
*   **Target Audience:** Clarify your intended audience. If you're writing for other engineering students, you can assume a certain level of understanding. If it's for a more general audience, you'll need to explain concepts more thoroughly.
*   **More technical detail:** The paper could go deeper into the underlying mathematical/algorithmic details.

**Specific Feedback**

**1. Introduction and Background**

*   **Motivation:** Briefly explain *why* attitude control is so critical for CubeSats. What are some common mission objectives that require precise attitude?
*   **ADACS Functions:** Include a brief explanation of each function. What does "attitude determination" *involve* (e.g., sensor data processing, filtering)?

**2. ADACS Hardware and Picosat**

*   **Picosat Description:** Elaborate more on the Picosat platform being considered. Specifics will make it more convincing.
*   **Actuator Trade-off:** Expand on the trade-off between weight, power, and available power that led to the selection of magnetic torque coils. What are the alternatives? What are their pros and cons?
*   **2-Axis Control:** Further explain the limitation of controlling only two axes at a time with magnetic torquers. The current explanation is a bit vague. Relate it more directly to the Earth's magnetic field vector and how the torque can only be applied perpendicular to it.

**3. Control Algorithms**

*   **General:**
    *   Explain what each term means.
    *   The paper lacks sufficient depth when describing control algorithms.
*   **B-Dot Controller:**
    *   Explain the formula of the B-Dot controller.
    *   Explain how the B-dot controller works in more detail. Provide the basic equations. What is the relationship between the measured rate of change of the magnetic field (B-dot) and the torque applied by the coils?
    *   Include the block diagram.
*   **Linear Quadratic Controller:**
    *   Expand on what "linearizing the systems dynamics" means in this context. What are the state variables? What are the control inputs?
    *   Give the general form of the cost function being minimized. How are the weighting matrices (Q and R) chosen?
    *   How is the gain matrix generated?
*   **Constant Gain Controller vs. LMI:**
    *   Table-1 (mentioned but not included). Include the table for the comparison. Be specific in the advantages and disadvantages.

**4. Recommendations**

*   **Simulations:** This is a good recommendation.
*   **Reference Satellites:** Mention the attitude control systems and mission objectives of the reference satellites (Norway's NCUBE, AAU Cubesat, GURWIN-techsat) *briefly*.

**5. Appendix (Mentioned but not Included)**

*   **Appendix-A:** Include it.
*   Ensure any figures are properly referenced.

**General Style and Clarity**

*   **Technical Vocabulary:** Use precise technical terms.
*   **Equations:** Include equations where appropriate to provide a more rigorous explanation of concepts and algorithms.
*   **Figures/Diagrams:** The inclusion of figures and diagrams enhances understanding. Make sure they are clearly labeled and referenced in the text.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Add more detail on the algorithms.**
2.  **Provide numerical results, if possible.** Consider including simulation results. This would make the paper much more convincing.
3.  **Add diagrams.**

Let me know if you'd like more details on any specific areas!
