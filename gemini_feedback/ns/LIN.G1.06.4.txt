Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can provide some feedback. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and areas for improvement, along with specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a solid understanding of the Landau (2001) article and engages critically with its arguments.  The author clearly identifies the main components of Landau's analysis, explains them in detail, and then raises several well-reasoned objections.  The paper is well-structured, generally clear, and shows an ability to think independently about complex linguistic phenomena. The attempt to replicate and critique the syntactic trees is commendable.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure: introduction, explication of Landau's paper, critical discussion, and conclusion. This makes it easy to follow the author's reasoning.
*   **Detailed Explanation of Landau's Argument:** The author does a thorough job of explaining the various components of Landau's analysis, including the OC Generalization, Extraposition, Chain Interpretation, and Argument Projection. The attempt to replicate Landau's trees is great.
*   **Thoughtful Critique:** The paper raises several insightful criticisms of Landau's analysis, focusing on issues such as:
    *   Inconsistent use of the term "extraposition."
    *   Lack of a clear motivation for intraposition.
    *   Problems with the Chain Interpretation condition.
    *   The role of c-command and m-command.
    *   Issues with theta and Case assignment.
*   **Independent Thinking:** The author doesn't just summarize Landau's argument but actively engages with it, offering alternative explanations and pointing out potential weaknesses.
*   **Good Understanding of Linguistic Concepts:** The paper demonstrates a strong grasp of relevant linguistic concepts such as obligatory control, non-obligatory control, extraposition, intraposition, LF/PF interpretation, theta roles, Case, c-command, and m-command.
*  **Acknowledging Limitations:** The writer often admits to certain uncertainties. This allows for the reader to understand the writer's train of thought and reasoning.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** While generally clear, some sections could benefit from greater clarity and conciseness. Complex sentences and technical jargon can sometimes obscure the main points. Aim for simpler phrasing and more direct statements. The critique section can especially benefit from stronger topic sentences.
*   **Strengthen the Argument:** Some criticisms could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples or alternative analyses. For instance, when arguing that Landau's use of "extraposition" is inconsistent, providing a specific example where it leads to a contradictory prediction would be helpful.
*   **Address Potential Counterarguments:** While the paper raises several good points, it could be improved by anticipating and addressing potential counterarguments to the author's criticisms. This would demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the issues.
*   **Deeper Dive into Alternatives:** The paper identifies problems with Landau's account, but it could be even stronger by offering more fully developed alternative solutions. Suggesting a different framework or a modified version of Landau's analysis could enhance the paper's impact.
*   **More Engagement with the Literature:** While the focus is on Landau (2001), briefly situating the critique within a broader theoretical context would be beneficial. Are these problems unique to Landau's approach, or are they common issues in the analysis of control?
*   **Proofreading:** There are a few minor grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper. A careful proofread is recommended.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:** Consider adding a sentence or two outlining the *specific* criticisms you will be making. This will give the reader a clearer roadmap.
*   **Section 2 (Landau's Paper):**
    *   While the detailed explanation is good, consider summarizing each component of Landau's analysis in a single sentence or two *before* launching into the full explanation. This will help the reader keep track of the overall argument.
*   **Section 3 (Discussion):**
    *   **"Inconsistent use of the term 'extraposition'":** Provide a specific example from Landau's paper where the application of "extraposition" seems contradictory or leads to an incorrect prediction.
    *   **"Lack of a clear motivation for intraposition":** Elaborate on why the EPP and VP-peripherality are not sufficient motivations. Explain why they are "stipulative" and why that's a problem.
    *   **"Problems with the Chain Interpretation condition":** Clarify how the Chain Interpretation condition *fails* to adequately explain the data. Explain how it could lead to incorrect predictions.
    *   **"The role of c-command and m-command":** Provide a concrete example illustrating how m-command might be a more relevant factor than c-command in determining control.
    *   **"Issues with theta and Case assignment":** Explain why the varying relations of theta and Case assignment lead to an "inconsistent theory." What specific problems arise from this inconsistency?
*   **Section 4 (Conclusion):** Briefly summarize the main criticisms and reiterate the key points. Consider ending with a suggestion for future research or a potential avenue for resolving the issues raised in the paper.
*   **Trees:** Double-check all the trees for accuracy. There seem to be some inconsistencies (as you have identified). Make sure the notation is consistent.

**Revised Snippets (Examples)**

*   **Original:** "The postulation of a phonetically null anaphoric pronominal, or PRO, has given rise an entire body of research within the Government and Binding and Minimalist programs."
*   **Revised:** "The existence of the phonetically null pronoun, PRO, has sparked extensive research within the Government and Binding and Minimalist frameworks."
*   **Original:** "Although he explicitly states the reason for extraposition, Landau does not provide the motivation for intraposition as one of his explanatory components."
*   **Revised:** "While Landau explicitly motivates extraposition, he does not provide a corresponding explicit motivation for intraposition."

By addressing these areas for improvement, you can strengthen your paper and make it an even more compelling critique of Landau's analysis. Good job! Let me know if you have any other questions.
