Okay, I've reviewed the paper. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-written and thoughtful paper that engages deeply with Kant's "Toward Perpetual Peace." It demonstrates a good understanding of Kant's arguments and attempts to update his ideas to a contemporary context. The writing is clear and academic, and the argument is generally well-structured. However, there are areas where the argument could be strengthened, made more concise, and more persuasive.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Understanding of Kant:** The paper accurately summarizes Kant's core arguments about perpetual peace, the three definitive articles, and the role of self-interest and moral duty.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure: introduction, explanation of Kant's argument, discussion of its relevance, and conclusion.
*   **Original Thought:** The paper offers an original interpretation of Kant, particularly in its emphasis on temporality and the historical contingency of the state.
*   **Good Writing Quality:** The paper is written in clear and concise prose, with appropriate academic tone and vocabulary.
*   **Engaging with Secondary Literature:** The paper cites Habermas and Doyle appropriately, showing an awareness of the scholarly conversation surrounding Kant's work.
*   **Addressing Potential Objections:** The paper anticipates potential criticisms of Kant and offers responses.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Abstract Introduction:** The introduction is a bit too general. It could be more specific by stating your thesis, and what aspects of "Toward Perpetual Peace" you plan to defend and modify, and why. The intro should give a more explicit roadmap of what the paper will do.
*   **Overly Detailed Summary:** The summary of Kant's argument (especially pages 2-4) could be more concise. Focus on the key elements that are *most* relevant to your own argument. It would be beneficial to highlight the points that you will later challenge or expand upon.
*   **Connection to the Real World:** While you discuss the historical contingency of Kant's ideas, there's room to better illustrate the paper with examples from the contemporary international political landscape. How are the current international institutions (e.g., the UN, the EU, trade agreements) reflecting or contradicting Kant's ideas?

*   **Unclear about Sovereignty:** The discussion of sovereignty is a crucial aspect of your argument, but it's a little dense and could be clearer. You're suggesting that sovereignty doesn't necessarily reside at the level of the state, but it's not completely clear where you *do* think it resides.
    *   **Suggestion:** Provide concrete examples of associations (besides the state) that exhibit sovereignty in the contemporary world. How do these associations demonstrate the ability to represent their members and enforce laws (or comparable rules)?
*   **Develop the "nature's plan" argument**: This is the weakest part of the argument and not the focus of the essay. It doesn't need to be mentioned or explored in depth.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is a bit weak. It could be more assertive and summarize the paper's key findings more forcefully.
*   **Organization**: The organization is okay, but the intro, body paragraphs and conclusion could be better connected for a better flow of the arguments.
*   **Thesis statement**: There isn't a concise thesis statement.

**Specific Suggestions by Page:**

*   **Page 1:** Strengthen the introduction with a clearer thesis statement. Briefly mention the specific ways in which you believe Kant's argument is still compelling and how it needs to be updated.
*   **Pages 2-4:** Condense the summary of Kant's argument. Focus on the core elements and highlight the points that are most relevant to your own interpretation.
*   **Pages 5-6:** Consider whether you need to discuss cosmopolitan right in such detail. Does it directly contribute to your central argument?
*   **Pages 7-8:** The discussion of the relationship between determinism and moral duty is interesting but could be more tightly integrated with the rest of the argument. Be explicit about how this relates to the feasibility of perpetual peace in the real world.
*   **Pages 9-10:** Clarify the discussion of sovereignty. Provide concrete examples of non-state associations that might exhibit sovereignty today. How do these associations represent their members and enforce rules?
*   **Page 11:** Make the connection to real-world examples even stronger. How are trends in representative government, international associations, and trade supporting Kant's vision?
*   **Page 12:** Strengthen the conclusion. Summarize the paper's main findings and reiterate the key reasons why Kant's argument is still relevant, despite its limitations.

**Overall, this is a promising paper with a clear understanding of Kant and an interesting argument. By addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions above, you can make it an even stronger and more persuasive piece of scholarship.**
