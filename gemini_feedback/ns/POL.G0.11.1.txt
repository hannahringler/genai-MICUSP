Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, including strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions.

**Overall Impression**

The paper is a solid effort at arguing that National Socialism in Germany shared core characteristics with other fascist movements. It uses historical evidence effectively to support its claims. The writing is generally clear, and the paper demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The paper establishes a clear thesis early on, arguing that despite its unique aspects, German National Socialism shared defining characteristics with other fascist movements.
*   **Strong Evidence:** The paper uses a variety of sources, including primary sources (quotes from Edgar Jung and Theodor Fritsch) and secondary sources (Goldhagen, Orlow, Cassels, Markovits), to support its arguments.
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper is organized logically, moving from the foundation of nationalism to the establishment of enemies and the abdication of freedom for stability.
*   **Good Understanding of Historical Context:** The paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the political and social context of Weimar Germany and the rise of Nazism.
*   **Effective Use of Quotes:** The quotes are well-chosen and effectively integrated into the argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Nuance and Counterarguments:** While the paper effectively argues for similarities, it could benefit from acknowledging and addressing some of the key differences or unique aspects of German National Socialism. A stronger paper would engage with arguments that might challenge its thesis.
*   **Deeper Analysis of Sources:** While the paper uses sources effectively, it could benefit from a deeper analysis of the authors' perspectives and biases. Consider briefly introducing the authors and their motivations.
*   **Clarity and Flow:** While the writing is generally clear, there are a few instances where the phrasing could be more precise or the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.
*   **Concluding Remarks:** The conclusion is somewhat abrupt. It could be strengthened by summarizing the main arguments and offering a more insightful closing statement. The conclusion should provide more of a punch.
*   **Typos/Grammar:** There were some typos or grammar mistakes in this writing. These can take away from the work by making it less clear.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   In the first paragraph, instead of stating that National Socialism *is often* viewed as unique, consider saying something like, "While National Socialism in Germany *is often characterized* as a unique phenomenon..." This makes the opening statement less of an assumption and more of a starting point for your argument.
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   **Paragraph 2:** After the Jung quote, consider elaborating on how this "blood" ideology connects to broader fascist themes. Is this emphasis on racial purity unique to German fascism, or is it a common thread? If common, say so.
    *   **Paragraph 3:** Use less passive voice. For example, "It had come in accordance..." could be "Fritsch argued that psychological laws dictated..." Active voice makes the writing more direct and impactful.
    *   **Paragraph 4:** When mentioning Goldhagen, consider briefly stating his central thesis about German eliminationist antisemitism. This provides context for the quote and strengthens your analysis.
    *   **Paragraph 5:** "Conservative Germans legitimate belief..." should be "Conservative Germans' legitimate belief..." and "emerged as the belief that the German public..." could be something like "Conservative Germans propagated the "stab-in-the-back" myth, claiming that..."
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Reiterate your thesis in a slightly different way.
    *   Consider adding a sentence or two about the lasting impact of the factors you discussed. Did these factors contribute to the extreme nature of the Holocaust? Did they set a precedent for future fascist movements?
    *   Leave the reader with a thought-provoking statement about the nature of fascism and its potential for recurrence.
*   **Nuance and Counterarguments:**
    *   Consider including a brief discussion of the role of antisemitism. Was the intensity of antisemitism unique to German National Socialism? If so, how did it interact with the other factors you discussed (nationalism, fear of enemies, etc.)?
    *   Acknowledge that German National Socialism was unique in its scale of extermination. Explain why you still believe that the underlying factors were similar to those in other fascist movements.

**Example Edits/Additions:**

*   **After the Jung quote:** "This emphasis on blood and destiny, while present in other fascist movements, took on a particularly virulent form in Germany due to pre-existing racial ideologies."
*   **Introduction Additions:** "While recognizing the unique horror of the Holocaust and the unprecedented scale of Nazi Germany's expansionist ambitions, this paper will demonstrate how the movement's success depended on factors common to fascist movements across Europe."
* **Conclusion Additions:** "These aspects of fascism, that provided a basis for the Nazi regime, may also be applicable to present day regimes. By understanding the historical events that resulted in the success of fascism in Germany, we may be able to prevent the success of modern-day fascist regimes."

**Revised Paragraph Example (Paragraph 5):**

"If the foundation of German fascism was nationalism, then the establishment of enemies during the Weimar Republic was the fuel that allowed National German Socialism to gain precedence and continue running. With the end of World War I, German soldiers and conservatives began to search for those to blame for the embarrassing defeat. Conservative Germans propagated the "stab-in-the-back" myth, claiming that the German public, especially Jews and Communists, had failed in their patriotic efforts to support the war. Andrei Markovits has argued that this narrative gained traction among right-wing groups seeking to undermine the Weimar government. This provided a convenient scapegoat for Germany's economic and political woes."

**By incorporating these suggestions, you can elevate your paper to a higher level of analysis and argumentation.** Good luck!
