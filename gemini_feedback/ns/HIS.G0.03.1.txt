Okay, I can provide some feedback on this essay. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and areas for improvement, along with specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The essay demonstrates a strong grasp of the core ideas of Smith and Malthus, particularly in the context of the Enlightenment and early modernization. The author articulates a clear thesis and supports it with relevant textual evidence. The writing is generally clear and sophisticated, and the essay displays a solid understanding of historical and intellectual context.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The essay establishes a clear and focused argument about how Smith and Malthus, despite sharing Enlightenment roots, arrived at different conclusions about the perfectibility of society due to their contrasting views on modernization.
*   **Strong Textual Evidence:** The essay effectively uses quotations from *The Wealth of Nations* and *An Essay on the Principle of Population* to support its claims. The citations are accurate.
*   **Good Understanding of Context:** The author demonstrates a good understanding of the intellectual context of the Enlightenment and its influence on both Smith and Malthus.
*   **Sophisticated Analysis:** The essay goes beyond simply summarizing the ideas of Smith and Malthus; it analyzes their arguments and identifies underlying assumptions.
*   **Well-Organized:** The essay is logically structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Deepen the Contrast and Nuance:** While the essay identifies the key differences between Smith and Malthus, it could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of their points of divergence. For example:
    *   **Explain the reasons more profoundly:** Instead of just stating *that* they disagreed, elaborate on *why* they saw modernization differently. What specific aspects of the emerging market economy did each focus on?
    *   **Address potential counterarguments:** Were there any points where Smith and Malthus perhaps converged or held similar concerns? Acknowledging these nuances could strengthen the overall argument.
*   **Elaborate on the "Ideal Subject":** The essay mentions that both Smith and Malthus offer visions of the "ideal subject," but this idea could be developed further.
    *   **Smith:** What are the characteristics of Smith's "rational individual" who contributes to societal productivity? How does this relate to his concepts of self-interest and the "invisible hand"?
    *   **Malthus:** Explain in more detail the link between Malthus's call for abstinence and his concept of the ideal citizen. What are the implications of this vision?
*   **Strengthen the Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the main points of the essay, but it could be more impactful by offering a final insight or reflection. For example, the conclusion could:
    *   Connect the ideas of Smith and Malthus to contemporary debates about inequality and economic development.
    *   Suggest the lasting significance of their contributions to social and economic thought.
*   **Address the Contradiction in Malthus:** More focus should be brought on the inherent contradiction of Malthus. He believes that mankind is imperfect, and thus the population must be kept in check, however, he imposes this burden on the lower classes. Why does he only suggest the poor adopt a policy of abstinence?

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Page 1:** The final sentence, "In The Wealth of Nations and An Essay on the Principle of Population, Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus share certain presuppositions about the way society operates" is a bit weak. It states the obvious, and it should be a statement that is more indicative of the argument that you are going to develop.

*   **Page 2:** When you quote Smith saying, "every," "all," and "always," explicitly state that you are providing examples of the Enlightenment thinking.

*   **Page 3:** After you introduce the reader to the idea of subsistence and production for Malthus, reiterate Smith's beliefs. Make it clear that these concepts are in contrast, rather than letting the reader assume that.

*   **Page 3:** "Despite their ostensible differences, however, both ultimately offer visions of the “ideal” subject." This transition sentence is slightly weak. Expand on what you mean by this.

*   **Page 4:** Make sure to emphasize the point of Smith believing that this ideal state is a harmony in society, and Malthus does not believe that this harmony is possible.

**Revised Conclusion (Example)**

"In conclusion, both Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus sought to understand the workings of society through the lens of Enlightenment reason. While Smith envisioned a future of progress and universal opulence driven by the division of labor and rational self-interest, Malthus foresaw a world constrained by natural limits and inherent inequality, thus making these scholars pessimistic and optimistic respectively. Though divided by their perspectives on modernization, both thinkers offered powerful (albeit contrasting) visions of the ideal individual and the good society that continue to resonate in contemporary debates about economics, social welfare, and the limits of growth."

**In Summary**

This is a well-written and insightful essay that demonstrates a strong understanding of Smith and Malthus. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can further refine your analysis and create an even more compelling argument.
