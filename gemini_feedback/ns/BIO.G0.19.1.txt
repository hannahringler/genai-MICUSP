Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper and some feedback, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-researched and reasoned argument for the U.S. government's involvement in controlling malaria. The paper is well-structured, presents a clear thesis, and uses evidence effectively. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the disease, its impact, and potential solutions. The writing is generally clear and concise. However, there are areas that could be strengthened, particularly in argumentation, nuance, and source integration.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Structure:** The paper clearly states its position (the U.S. should be involved in malaria control) and provides a logical structure to support that position. The sections are well-defined.
*   **Strong Use of Evidence:** The paper uses statistics and facts effectively to illustrate the severity of the problem and support its claims. You use credible sources.
*   **Well-Informed:** The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the biological, economic, and social aspects of malaria.
*   **Compelling Argument:** The paper makes a persuasive case for U.S. involvement by highlighting the human cost, economic impact, and the potential for a positive return on investment.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The writing is generally clear and easy to understand.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Oversimplification/Lack of Nuance:** The argument can sometimes be a bit simplistic and lacks nuance. It presents a somewhat idealized view of how effective U.S. intervention will be without addressing potential challenges.
*   **Counterarguments:** The paper could benefit from acknowledging and addressing potential counterarguments more directly.  For example: What are the arguments *against* U.S. involvement?  What are the potential pitfalls of the proposed intervention? Addressing these strengthens the overall argument.
*   **Source Integration:** While sources are cited, the paper could integrate the information from them more seamlessly into the text.  Sometimes it feels like facts are dropped in without sufficient context or explanation.
*   **Rhetorical Exaggeration:** While passion is good, there are places where the paper uses slightly hyperbolic language that could be toned down for greater impact. For instance, the 9/11 comparison, while effective in highlighting the scale of the problem, is arguably too emotionally charged and could be perceived as insensitive.
*   **Generalizations:** Some claims are broad. For example, it's stated that better economies increase household spending or "purchasing power." While generally true, it could be refined for specifics related to this context.

**Specific Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Address Counterarguments:**
    *   Acknowledge potential concerns about the cost of intervention. Show how these costs can be mitigated.
    *   Discuss potential challenges in implementing the proposed programs (e.g., corruption, logistical difficulties, cultural barriers).
    *   Address arguments that U.S. resources should be focused on domestic problems.
*   **Refine the Argument:**
    *   Go beyond simply stating that U.S. involvement is good.  Discuss *how* the U.S. can be most effective.
    *   Provide more specific recommendations for the intervention program, including clear, measurable goals and indicators of success.
    *   Explore the different ways the U.S. can contribute (e.g., funding, research, technical assistance, policy advocacy).
*   **Source Integration:**
    *   Instead of just stating facts from sources, explain the significance of the fact and how it supports the overall argument.
    *   Use transition words to connect sourced information more smoothly to the surrounding text.
*   **Strengthen the Economic Argument:**
    *   Provide more specific data on the economic benefits of malaria control (e.g., increased productivity, reduced healthcare costs).
    *   Discuss the potential for sustainable economic development in malaria-endemic regions.
*   **Tone Down Rhetorical Exaggeration:**
    *   While the 9/11 comparison is effective in highlighting the scale of the problem, consider whether it is the most appropriate analogy.  A more nuanced comparison might be more effective.

**Specific Examples to Illustrate:**

*   **Original:** "Every year, Malaria kills at least 400 times the amount of people that terrorist attacks on 9/11 did."
    *   **Revised:** "While the terrorist attacks of 9/11 were a tragic event that shook the United States, malaria claims at least 400 times as many lives annually, highlighting the significant global burden of this disease." (This is less emotionally charged and more factual.)
*   **Original:** "Malaria causes absenteeism from work, decrease in productivity, and decreased morale of workers."
    *   **Revised:** "Malaria significantly impacts productivity in endemic regions.  Studies have shown that malaria-related absenteeism leads to a [specific percentage]% decrease in worker output, resulting in substantial economic losses." (This provides more concrete information.)

**In summary:**

This is a strong paper that demonstrates a good understanding of the issue. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above and refining the argument, the paper can be elevated to an even higher level. The key is to add nuance, address counterarguments, and integrate sources more effectively. Good luck!
