**Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Concise Writing:** The writing is generally clear and easy to understand. It effectively conveys the author's thoughts and experiences.
*   **Personal Reflection:** The paper demonstrates personal reflection and introspection. The author successfully connects the course concepts to their own experiences and worldview.
*   **Insightful Observations:** The author's observations about the news media's focus on negativity and the pureness of altruistic acts show insightful thinking.
*   **Connection to Research:** The connection between the course and the author's research project is a strong point, highlighting the practical application of positive psychology principles.
*   **Good Structure:** The paper has a logical flow, starting with a general observation about media negativity and then moving to personal experiences and reflections.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Exploration:** While the reflections are good, some areas could be explored in greater depth. For example, the author could elaborate on the specific aspects of positive psychology that resonated with them or how they plan to incorporate positive psychology into their life.
*   **Clarity on Impact:** The specific ways positive psychology has impacted thinking could be more direct and more specific, avoiding potentially vague statements. The link between the course and the author's changed approach to research is a good starting point, and could be made more specific.
*   **Refine the Act of Kindness Story:** The pizza story is relatable, but could be enhanced. Adding more detail about the students' expressions or a description of the atmosphere would make it more vivid. You could also consider how the act of kindness relates to specific concepts from the course.
*   **Avoid Generalities:** Phrases like "acting in kind ways throughout the semester" could be replaced with specific examples or more concrete descriptions of the author's actions.

**Suggestions for Revision:**

*   **Expand on the Personal Connection:** In the introduction, briefly mention a specific concept or idea from the Positive Psychology Seminar that stood out.
*   **Elaborate on the Research Impact:** Provide a specific example of how the author's perspective on their research has changed due to the course. Instead of just saying they are looking at the "opposite side," explain the specific research questions or methodologies that might be influenced.
*   **Conclude with a Stronger Statement:** Strengthen the conclusion by directly stating how the course's lessons will be applied in the future, perhaps by expanding on the research or by addressing specific real-world problems.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Give the paper a final proofread to catch any minor grammatical or spelling errors.

**Overall:**

This is a thoughtful and well-written paper that effectively demonstrates the author's understanding of positive psychology and its potential impact. By addressing the areas for improvement, the paper can be even more compelling and insightful.
