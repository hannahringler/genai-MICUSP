Okay, here's some feedback on the essay "MacBeth by Roman Polanski." I'll focus on clarity, argumentation, use of evidence, and overall structure.

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, the essay's central argument is that Polanski's *MacBeth* emphasizes the title character's inherent barbarity and the violent consequences of ambition, achieving this through specific visual and directorial choices. The essay then analyzes how Polanski uses visual techniques to demonstrate Macbeth's moral failings and the film's supernatural elements.
*   **Specific Examples:** The essay draws upon specific scenes from Polanski's *MacBeth* to support its claims. The analysis of the banquet scene is particularly strong.
*   **Insightful Observations:** The essay identifies several insightful points about Polanski's directorial choices and their effect on the viewer's perception of Macbeth. The observation about the use of voiceover to internalize Macbeth's thoughts is a good example.
*   **Well-Written:** The writing is generally clear and grammatically sound.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Explicit Thesis Statement:** The essay would benefit from a clearer, more explicit thesis statement in the introduction. This statement should directly articulate the essay's central argument. For example: "In his adaptation of *Macbeth*, Roman Polanski departs from traditional interpretations by emphasizing Macbeth's inherent barbarity through disturbing visual imagery and deliberate directorial choices, thus portraying him not as a tragic hero but as a violent embodiment of ruthless ambition."

*   **Deeper Analysis:** While the essay identifies specific techniques, it could delve deeper into *why* Polanski made those choices and *what specific effects* they have on the audience.
    *   For example, regarding the severed hand, you could discuss how this stark image affects the audience's perception of violence and fate. The connection of this image to Lady Macbeth's suicide is also worth mentioning.
    *   In the banquet scene, instead of only mentioning the camera pans and position of characters, elaborate on the effect the change of size has on the audience. What happens when Macbeth is dwarfed in a large area?

*   **Elaboration on 'Natural Film':** The conclusion states: “This blatant carnage added a supernatural feel to an almost natural film.” Explain what you mean by “almost natural film” and contrast this with other versions of *Macbeth*.

*   **Consider Counterarguments/Nuance:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments or alternative interpretations. For example, some might argue that Polanski's film is overly gratuitous or that it sacrifices some of the play's psychological complexity. Briefly acknowledging and refuting these arguments would strengthen the essay's credibility.

*   **Structure and Transitions:** While the essay has a clear structure, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and create a more cohesive argument. For example, "Building upon this visual emphasis on barbarity..." or "Furthermore, Polanski utilizes...".

*   **Evidence from Shakespeare's Text:** Ground your analysis in the original play. Referencing specific lines or themes from Shakespeare's *Macbeth* would strengthen your argument by demonstrating how Polanski's interpretation aligns with or deviates from the source material.

*   **Don't Explain Ha Ha:** It's probably not a good idea to explain "ha ha" in formal writing.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Start with a broader hook about the enduring appeal of *Macbeth* and its various interpretations.
    *   Provide brief background on Polanski and his directorial style (especially his penchant for dark and violent themes).
    *   End with a clear, concise thesis statement.
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence that clearly states the main point.
    *   Follow the topic sentence with specific examples from the film, providing vivid descriptions of the scenes.
    *   Analyze the examples in detail, explaining *why* Polanski made those choices and *what effects* they have on the viewer.
    *   Connect the examples back to the thesis statement, demonstrating how they support your overall argument.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the main points of the essay.
    *   Reiterate the thesis statement in a new and insightful way.
    *   Offer a final thought or reflection on the significance of Polanski's interpretation.
    *   Avoid introducing new information or arguments in the conclusion.
    *   Consider ending with a broader statement about the nature of ambition, violence, or the enduring power of Shakespeare.

**Revised Conclusion Example:**
"In conclusion, Roman Polanski's *Macbeth* offers a stark and uncompromising vision of Shakespeare's tragedy, one that emphasizes Macbeth's inherent barbarity and the brutal consequences of unchecked ambition. By prioritizing disturbing visual imagery and visceral violence, Polanski creates a film that is less concerned with psychological nuance than with portraying the raw, destructive power of evil. While this interpretation may deviate from more sympathetic portrayals of the title character, it ultimately serves to underscore the enduring relevance of *Macbeth* as a cautionary tale about the corrupting influence of power."

By addressing these points, you can further strengthen your essay and make it a more compelling and insightful analysis of Polanski's *MacBeth*.
