Okay, I've reviewed the paper you provided. Here's a breakdown of its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper is a well-structured and insightful analysis of the portrayal of menstruation in James Joyce's *Ulysses*. You have a strong grasp of the text and develop a compelling argument about how Joyce uses menstruation to comment on sensationalism, confinement, realism, and intimacy. Your analysis of Gerty Macdowell in "Nausicaa" and "Circe" is particularly strong.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** You clearly state your thesis in the introduction and consistently develop it throughout the paper.
*   **Strong Textual Analysis:** You provide close readings of specific passages, using them to support your claims effectively. You effectively weave in quotations from *Ulysses*.
*   **Insightful Interpretation:** You offer insightful interpretations of the text, connecting the portrayal of menstruation to broader themes of femininity, cultural expectations, and intimacy.
*   **Well-Organized Structure:** The paper is logically organized, with each paragraph building upon the previous one.
*   **Engaging Writing Style:** Your writing style is clear, concise, and engaging, making the paper a pleasure to read.
*   **Sophisticated Understanding of Joyce:** You demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of Joyce's literary techniques and his engagement with social and cultural issues.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Nuance in the Conclusion:** While your conclusion summarizes your argument effectively, it could benefit from a more nuanced reflection on the implications of your analysis. Consider what your analysis reveals about Joyce's overall project in *Ulysses* or about the broader cultural significance of representing menstruation in literature.
*   **Potential Expansion on Molly's Perspective:** You touch on Molly's perspective in "Penelope," but there's an opportunity to explore it in more depth. How does her frankness about menstruation challenge or reinforce existing notions of femininity and intimacy?

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**

    *   The introduction effectively sets up the topic and thesis. Consider adding a sentence or two that explicitly outlines the structure of your argument, giving the reader a roadmap of what to expect.
*   **"Nausicaa" Analysis:**

    *   Your analysis of Gerty's self-narration and the intrusion of cultural scripts is excellent.
    *   The connection between Gerty's menstrual blood and religious imagery is insightful.
*   **"Circe" Analysis:**

    *   Your discussion of Gerty's heightened, perverted version of herself in "Circe" is compelling.
    *   You could further explore the significance of Bloom's reaction to Gerty's "bloodied clout." How does this moment challenge his own perceptions of femininity and sexuality?
*   **"Penelope" Analysis:**

    *   Your discussion of Molly's perspective is good, but could be expanded upon.
    *   Consider analyzing specific passages from "Penelope" in more detail, focusing on Molly's language and imagery.
    *   You mention Joyce's own erotic love letters to his wife, Nora. While this is a good point, briefly explaining how this is connected to his view of bodies in intimacy may reinforce your overall argument.

*   **Conclusion:**

    *   Consider ending with a more thought-provoking statement about the broader implications of Joyce's portrayal of menstruation. For example, you could discuss how his work paved the way for more open and honest representations of women's bodies in literature.

**Example Revisions**

*   **Original Conclusion Snippet:** "In "Circe,” Joyce sensationalizes menstruation by his extreme depiction and in “Penelope” he sensationalizes menstruation by revealing its ordinariness. Both portrayals problematize a reader's understanding of gender and allow a space to consider femininity, violence, and intimacy."

*   **Revised Conclusion Snippet:** "In "Circe,” Joyce sensationalizes menstruation through extreme depiction, while in “Penelope” he does so by revealing its inherent ordinariness. These contrasting portrayals, set against the backdrop of Gerty's constrained narrative, challenge readers' preconceived notions of gender and open a space to reconsider femininity, violence, and the very essence of intimacy. *Ulysses* ultimately suggests that true connection requires a radical acceptance of the body, in all its messy and imperfect glory, defying the cultural pressures to sanitize and idealize the female experience."

**Final Thoughts:**

This is a strong paper with a clear argument and insightful analysis. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can further refine your argument and elevate the paper to an even higher level. Good job! Let me know if you have any further questions.
