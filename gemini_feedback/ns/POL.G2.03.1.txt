Okay, I can provide feedback on your paper "Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Crime and the Consequences for Immigrants: Deportation Policy, Aggravated Felonies, and Judicial Review."

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles a complex and important issue with evident effort. The topic is timely and relevant, and the arguments demonstrate research and critical thinking. However, the paper could benefit from further refinement in terms of organization, clarity, and argumentation.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important and Timely Topic:** Immigration policy and its intersection with crime is a significant area of debate.
*   **Good Research:** You appear to have consulted a good range of sources (academic publications, government reports, legal documents), indicated in your bibliography.
*   **Detailed Overview:** The paper provides a reasonably thorough overview of the historical development of deportation policy and the specific elements of IIRIRA.
*   **Identification of Key Problems:** You clearly articulate four major problems with current deportation policy, providing a structured framework for your analysis.
*   **Policy Alternatives:** The paper offers specific policy alternatives that address the identified problems, demonstrating your ability to think critically about potential solutions.
*   **Data and Statistics:** You attempt to support your claims with some data (tables on crime rates, sentencing), which strengthens your arguments (though see comments below).

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Organization and Structure:**
    *   **Clarity of Thesis:** While the paper has a clear topic, the central argument or thesis statement needs to be more explicitly stated, preferably in the introduction. What specific point are you trying to prove or argue beyond simply outlining the problems?
    *   **Transitions:** Improve the flow between sections and paragraphs. Use stronger transitions to connect ideas and arguments. Make the logical relationship between paragraphs more evident.
    *   **Length & Summary:** It seems lengthy, so a summary of some kind might also be useful so that it's clear what the argument is.

2.  **Argumentation:**
    *   **Depth of Analysis:** At times, the analysis feels somewhat descriptive rather than deeply analytical. Push beyond simply stating problems to explaining *why* these problems are significant and *how* they impact immigrants, the justice system, and society.
    *   **Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments to your proposed policy alternatives. Why might some people oppose these changes?
    *   **More Analysis of Statistical Data:**
        *   **Interpretation:** Explain what the tables and statistics *mean* in the context of your argument. What specific conclusions can be drawn from the data that support your points?
        *   **Sourcing:** Make sure you source the data that you present.

3.  **Clarity and Precision:**
    *   **Definitions:** Ensure that key terms like "aggravated felony," "moral turpitude," and "discretionary relief" are clearly defined and explained. Assume your reader may not be familiar with these terms.
    *   **Jargon:** Minimize legal and policy jargon or explain it clearly when used.
    *   **Conciseness:** The paper can be quite dense and sometimes repetitive. Strive for conciseness in your writing. Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases.

4.  **Policy Alternatives:**

    *   **Feasibility and Implementation:** Discuss the feasibility of your policy alternatives in greater detail. How would these changes be implemented? What are the potential challenges and costs involved?
    *   **Potential Consequences:** Consider the potential unintended consequences of your proposed policies. Could they have negative impacts on certain groups or create new problems?
    *   **Evidence-Based Support:** If possible, provide evidence or examples to support the effectiveness of your policy alternatives. Have similar policies been implemented in other jurisdictions? What were the results?

5.  **Grammar and Style:**
    *   **Proofread Carefully:** Thoroughly proofread the paper for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors. Consider using a grammar checker or asking someone to proofread for you.
    *   **Academic Tone:** Maintain a formal and objective academic tone throughout the paper.

**Specific suggestions based on the text:**

*   **Introduction:** You can mention the rationale behind IRCA in terms of the anti-immigration policies. However, you need to explicitly state your own argument or position in a clear, concise, and compelling manner.
*   **Background:** The historical context is valuable.
*   **Policy Problems:** This section is well-structured. However, the analysis could be more in-depth.
*   **Policy Alternatives:**
    *   Discuss the potential challenges and costs of increasing the number of immigration judges. Are there enough qualified individuals to fill these positions? How would this expansion be funded?
    *   **Elaborate on "atypical determinations."** What factors would justify denying discretionary relief in specific cases?
    *   **Address the Potential for Increased Backlogs:** How would your policy alternatives prevent an increase in backlogs, given the added complexities of distinguishing between violent and nonviolent crimes and considering individual circumstances?

**In summary:**

This paper demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and solid research efforts. By focusing on clarifying your thesis, strengthening your arguments with evidence and analysis, and refining your writing style, you can significantly improve the quality and impact of your work.
