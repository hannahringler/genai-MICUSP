Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper, assuming it's focused on organizational change management within the context of a car dealership (Petersen Motor Company - PMC). Here's a breakdown of potential strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a decent attempt to analyze organizational issues within PMC and propose a change management plan. The diagnosis of problems (pay basis, diversity, communication) is reasonable, and the suggested changes aim for a holistic and synergistic approach. However, the paper could benefit from more depth, stronger evidence, and a more realistic and practical change implementation plan.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper is well-organized with clear sections (Introduction, Diagnosis, Approach to Change, Anticipated Support/Resistance, Change Plan, and References). This makes it easy to follow the argument.
*   **Identifies Relevant Issues:** The three key issues identified (pay basis, work-group diversity, and communication style) are all plausible and potentially impactful on dealership performance.
*   **Synergistic Approach:** The idea of implementing changes simultaneously to leverage synergistic effects is a good one and demonstrates an understanding of complex organizational dynamics.
*   **Acknowledges Resistance:** Recognizing that employees will resist change is crucial for any successful change management plan.
*   **References:** The use of references, while limited, adds some credibility to the analysis.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Empirical Evidence:** The analysis is largely based on assertions and generalizations about the automotive dealership industry. There's a lack of specific data, metrics, or examples from PMC to support the claims.
*   **Superficial Analysis:** The diagnosis of each issue could be more in-depth. For example, the discussion of communication styles is somewhat vague and doesn't offer concrete examples of the "cliché-ridden conversation."
*   **Unrealistic Expectations:** Some of the proposed changes, particularly regarding cross-functional teams and widespread cross-training, seem overly optimistic and may not be feasible in practice without significant investment in training and cultural change.
*   **Limited Change Plan:** The "Change Plan" section is too brief and lacks detail. It doesn't address specific steps, timelines, resource allocation, or metrics for success.
*   **Generalizations:** The paper makes sweeping generalizations, such as “U.S. dealerships have stagnated in operational efficiency and worker fulfillment.” Support these statements with data or citations.
*   **Lack of Contingency Planning:** The change plan doesn't address potential roadblocks or alternative strategies if the initial approach doesn't work. What happens if employees strongly resist the changes? Are there backup plans?
*   **Limited Scope:** The paper focuses primarily on internal changes. It doesn't adequately consider external factors (e.g., market competition, technological advancements) that might influence the dealership's success.
*   **Writing Style:** While generally clear, the writing could be more concise and impactful. Some sentences are a bit wordy.

**Areas for Improvement & Specific Suggestions:**

**1. Strengthen the Diagnosis with Evidence:**

*   **Gather Data:** Conduct interviews with PMC employees (managers, technicians, sales staff, etc.) to understand their perspectives on the current issues.
*   **Analyze Existing Data:** Look at PMC's internal data on sales, customer satisfaction (CSI), employee turnover, repair times, and other relevant metrics to quantify the problems.
*   **Provide Specific Examples:** Instead of saying "mechanistic communication style," provide a concrete example of a typical conversation between a service advisor and a customer that illustrates the problem.

**2. Make the Proposed Changes More Realistic and Specific:**

*   **Pilot Programs:** Instead of implementing changes across the entire dealership at once, consider starting with a pilot program in one department to test the feasibility and refine the approach.
*   **Phased Implementation:** Break down the changes into smaller, more manageable steps that can be implemented over time.
*   **Training and Development:** Develop specific training programs to help employees acquire the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the new environment (e.g., cross-training, communication skills, teamwork).
*   **Incentive Alignment:** Carefully design the new pay plan to ensure that it truly aligns employee incentives with organizational goals. Consider both individual and team-based incentives.

**3. Develop a More Detailed Change Plan:**

*   **Define Objectives:** Clearly state the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives for each change initiative.
*   **Outline Specific Steps:** Describe the concrete actions that will be taken to implement each change.
*   **Assign Responsibilities:** Identify who will be responsible for each step of the change process.
*   **Establish Timelines:** Create a realistic timeline for implementing the changes.
*   **Allocate Resources:** Determine the resources (budget, personnel, equipment, etc.) that will be needed for each change initiative.
*   **Define Metrics:** Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to track progress and measure the success of the changes.
*   **Communication Strategy:** Develop a detailed communication plan to keep employees informed about the changes and address their concerns.

**4. Address Resistance to Change More Proactively:**

*   **Identify Key Resistors:** Anticipate which employees are most likely to resist the changes and understand their reasons for resistance.
*   **Involve Employees:** Involve employees in the change process as early as possible to get their input and build buy-in.
*   **Address Concerns:** Actively listen to employees' concerns and address them openly and honestly.
*   **Provide Support:** Offer training, coaching, and mentoring to help employees adapt to the new environment.

**5. Broaden the Scope:**

*   **External Environment:** Analyze the competitive landscape and identify external factors that might impact the dealership's success.
*   **Technology:** Consider how technology can be used to improve efficiency, customer service, and communication.

**6. Improve Writing and Clarity:**

*   **Conciseness:** Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases.
*   **Specificity:** Replace vague terms with concrete examples.
*   **Clarity:** Ensure that your writing is clear and easy to understand.
*   **Proofread:** Carefully proofread your paper for grammar and spelling errors.

**Example Edits:**

*   **Original:** "Dealership employees generally want to help each other, and the mantra 'everyone need's their cut' is often put into practice."
*   **Revised:** "Employees often prioritize ensuring everyone gets a portion of the revenue, leading to inefficient processes. For example, a repair might be routed through multiple departments to increase commissions, even if it's not the most efficient path."

*   **Original:** "A commission pay basis has been adopted in most U.S. automotive dealerships, and is attractive for several reasons."
*   **Revised:** "Commission-based pay is common in U.S. dealerships due to its perceived benefits: increased employee motivation and direct link between performance and compensation." (Then, elaborate with citations)

**In summary, this paper is a good starting point, but needs more in-depth analysis, concrete evidence, and a more practical and detailed change implementation plan to be truly effective. Focus on gathering data, providing specific examples, and developing a clear roadmap for change.**
