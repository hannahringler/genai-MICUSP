Okay, here's some feedback on the paper "Curriculum Changes in the Progressive Era and Great Depression," focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper provides a concise overview of curriculum changes in the US during a significant historical period. It demonstrates a good understanding of the key players, movements, and legislation involved. The writing is generally clear and well-organized.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis/Focus:**  The paper clearly sets out to discuss curriculum changes during the Progressive Era and the Great Depression, making it easy for the reader to follow the argument.
*   **Well-Researched:**  The use of primary and secondary sources from prominent figures in education history (Dewey, Kliebard, Tyack) demonstrates thorough research and an awareness of authoritative scholarship.
*   **Good Organization:** The paper is logically structured, moving chronologically through the historical developments and highlighting key turning points. The flow of ideas is easy to follow.
*   **Relevant Examples:** The paper provides specific examples of curriculum changes, such as the Committee of Ten, Life Adjustment, and the Cardinal Principles, which strengthens the argument.
*   **Awareness of Complexity:**  The paper doesn't present a simplistic narrative. It acknowledges the complexities and tensions within the progressive movement, such as the diverging interpretations of Dewey's ideas and the criticisms of Life Adjustment.
*   **Connects to Current Trends:** The discussion of "No Child Left Behind" and standards-based education connects the historical overview to contemporary issues in education, suggesting the continuing relevance of these past debates.
* **Correct Citations:** The endnotes were correct.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Deeper Analysis/Interpretation:** While the paper presents a factual account, it could benefit from more in-depth analysis and interpretation of the changes. For example:
    *   *Why* were these changes occurring at specific times? What were the broader social, economic, and political forces driving them?
    *   What were the *unintended consequences* of these reforms?
    *   How did these changes *impact different groups* of students (e.g., by race, class, gender)?
    *   You can give more detailed information about the impacts of these curriculum changes.
*   **Stronger Argumentative Voice:** While the paper provides a historical overview, it could benefit from a stronger argumentative voice. Consider:
    *   Do you have a specific argument about the overall trajectory of curriculum changes during this period?
    *   What are the lasting legacies of the Progressive Era and Great Depression on contemporary education?
    *   What insights does this historical analysis offer for current educational debates?
*   **Specificity and Elaboration:**  While the paper touches on key concepts, it could benefit from more specific examples and elaboration. For instance:
    *   *What specific kinds of "life skills" were emphasized in the Cardinal Principles?*
    *   *How did the vocational and general tracks actually differ in terms of curriculum and pedagogy?*
    *   *What were some of the specific criticisms of the "subject-based curriculum" that Life Adjustment sought to address?*
* **Proofreading:** Some of the words are connected to each other. Be sure to proofread.
*   **Contemporary Source:** All the sources used are older. Using more contemporary sources may give a more updated look into the educational movement.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Elaborate on the "Progressive Movement":** Briefly define the core tenets of the Progressive Movement in education to provide context for the curriculum changes. This will provide a clearer framework for understanding the motivations behind the reforms.
*   **Consider the Role of Social Class:**  Address the ways in which curriculum changes were shaped by and reinforced existing social class hierarchies. The discussion of vocational tracks and Life Adjustment could be strengthened by analyzing their potential impact on different social classes.
*   **Address the Impact on Teachers:**  Discuss the impact of these changes on teachers and their pedagogical practices. How did teachers adapt to the new curriculum models, and what challenges did they face?
*   **Refine the Conclusion:** The conclusion could be more impactful by summarizing the key arguments and offering a more definitive statement about the significance of this historical period for contemporary education.

**In summary:** The paper provides a solid overview of curriculum changes during a transformative period in US education history. By adding more in-depth analysis, a stronger argumentative voice, and more specific examples, you can elevate the paper to a higher level of scholarship.
