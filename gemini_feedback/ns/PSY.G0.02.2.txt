Okay, I've read through the paper. Here's a breakdown of feedback, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper provides a decent overview and critique of Rosenhan's study. It correctly identifies some strengths and weaknesses of the research and discusses its impact. However, the analysis could be deeper and more nuanced. The writing is generally clear but can be improved with more precise language and a stronger argumentative focus.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Summary:** The paper provides a good summary of Rosenhan's study and its central claims.
*   **Identification of Strengths and Weaknesses:** The paper correctly identifies some key strengths and weaknesses of Rosenhan's methodology, particularly the use of participant observation and the ethical concerns regarding lack of informed consent.
*   **Discussion of Impact:** The paper acknowledges the significant impact Rosenhan's study had on the field of psychology and its influence on diagnostic practices and societal perceptions of mental illness.
*   **Organization:** The paper has a logical structure, progressing from a summary of Rosenhan's work to a discussion of its implications, strengths, and weaknesses.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** The critique often feels superficial. The paper mentions strengths and weaknesses but doesn't always delve deeply into *why* they are strengths or weaknesses, or *how* they specifically affect the study's validity and reliability.
*   **Argumentative Focus:** While the paper is labeled as an "Argumentative Essay," the argument is not very strong. It mostly presents both sides without taking a clear, defensible position. What is the paper ultimately arguing about Rosenhan's study? Is it arguing that the study was fundamentally flawed, or that its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, or something else entirely?
*   **Lack of Nuance:** The paper sometimes presents overly simplistic views. For example, it states that society blames mentally ill patients for their diagnosis without providing supporting evidence or acknowledging the complexity of societal attitudes.
*   **Generalizations:** The paper makes some broad generalizations (e.g., "the majority of society blames a mentally ill patient") that lack specific evidence or supporting arguments.
*   **Reliance on Description:** The paper tends to describe Rosenhan's study and its implications rather than critically analyzing them.
*   **Writing Style:** While generally clear, the writing can be more precise and engaging. Some sentences are a bit wordy or vague.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Develop a Stronger Argument:**
    *   **Thesis Statement:** Clearly state the central argument in the introduction. What is your overall assessment of Rosenhan's study? Is it a groundbreaking piece of research despite its flaws, or is it fundamentally flawed and unreliable?
    *   **Support Your Claims:** Every statement you make should be supported by evidence or logical reasoning. Don't just say something is a strength or weakness; explain *why* it is.
    *   **Address Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments to your claims. This will strengthen your argument and demonstrate that you have considered different perspectives.

2.  **Deepen the Analysis:**
    *   **Explore the Ethical Issues in More Detail:** Discuss the specific ethical guidelines that Rosenhan's study violated. How could the study have been designed differently to address these ethical concerns?
    *   **Analyze the Impact of Observer Bias:** How might the pseudopatients' expectations and beliefs have influenced their observations and interpretations of events in the psychiatric hospitals?
    *   **Examine the Validity of the Diagnoses:** Did the pseudopatients truly exhibit no symptoms of mental illness before entering the hospitals? Could their behavior have been interpreted as signs of underlying distress?
    *   **Consider Alternative Explanations:** Are there alternative explanations for the findings of Rosenhan's study? Could the behavior of the hospital staff have been influenced by factors other than devaluation of mentally ill patients?

3.  **Refine the Writing:**
    *   **Use More Precise Language:** Avoid vague or ambiguous terms. Choose words that accurately convey your meaning.
    *   **Vary Sentence Structure:** Use a mix of short and long sentences to create a more engaging and readable style.
    *   **Eliminate Wordiness:** Cut out unnecessary words and phrases. Be concise and to the point.
    *   **Provide Specific Examples:** Instead of making general statements, provide specific examples to illustrate your points.

4.  **Address the following specific points in the paper:**
    *   **Page 1:** "Perhaps the endurance of Rosenhan's article is in part due to one of his major claims." This is a weak way to introduce the importance of the claim. Be more direct and state the claim's importance explicitly.
    *   **Page 2:** "Quite obviously, much is at stake if Rosenhan's major claim is considered to be true." This statement is too broad. Be specific about *what* is at stake.
    *   **Page 2:** "While they may be hesitant to admit it, the majority of society blames a mentally ill patient for his or her own diagnosis." This is a strong claim that needs evidence. Where does this belief come from? Is it based on research, personal observations, or other sources?
    *   **Page 3:** "Rosenhan does his best to include both male and female participants, a variety of professional backgrounds, and a rage of hospital settings..." "Rage" should be "range".
    *   **Page 4:** "A second weakness involves the quality of Rosenhan's data, which may be considered questionable." Explain *why* the data is questionable. What specific biases might have affected the data?
    *   **Page 5:** "Although the possibility of observer bias is important, if often lacks the power necessary to make people question the results of this study." This sentence is confusing. Rephrase for clarity.

**Revised Structure Suggestion:**

Here's a possible revised structure to help you develop a stronger argumentative focus:

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Briefly introduce Rosenhan's study and its main claims.
    *   State your thesis statement, clearly outlining your overall assessment of the study.
2.  **Summary of Rosenhan's Study:**
    *   Provide a concise summary of the study's methodology and findings.
3.  **Strengths of Rosenhan's Study:**
    *   Discuss the strengths of the study, providing specific examples and explaining *why* they are strengths.
4.  **Weaknesses of Rosenhan's Study:**
    *   Discuss the weaknesses of the study, providing specific examples and explaining *why* they are weaknesses.
    *   Dedicate significant space to ethical considerations and methodological limitations.
5.  **Impact and Significance:**
    *   Analyze the impact and significance of Rosenhan's study on the field of psychology and society.
    *   Discuss whether the study's strengths outweigh its weaknesses in terms of its overall contribution to knowledge.
6.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Restate your thesis statement in light of the evidence you have presented.
    *   Offer a final evaluation of Rosenhan's study and its lasting legacy.

By focusing on developing a clear argument, deepening the analysis, and refining the writing, you can significantly improve the quality of your paper. Good luck!
