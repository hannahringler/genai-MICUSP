Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, broken down into different categories:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Focused Argument:** The paper has a clear central argument: that the U.S. government should continue to be involved in controlling malaria, and even reallocate some resources to anti-malaria programs in specific regions.
*   **Well-Researched:** The paper cites several credible sources, including the CDC, WHO, and the White House.
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, progressing from an overview of malaria to a discussion of the problem, control measures, U.S. involvement, and a comparative analysis of costs and benefits.
*   **Good Use of Evidence:** You support your arguments with statistics, examples, and evidence from your sources.
*   **Engaging Writing Style:** The writing is clear, concise, and relatively engaging.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper provides a good overview, it could benefit from a deeper analysis of the complexities of malaria control and the various factors involved.
*   **Counterarguments:** While the paper makes a good argument for U.S. involvement, it would be stronger if it addressed counterarguments more thoroughly.
*   **More Specific Recommendations:** While the paper suggests reallocating resources from the pandemic flu program, it could be more specific about how those resources should be used.
*   **Addressing the Question of Prioritization.** You touch on this, but this could be a bigger focus.
*   **Clarity of some sentence structure.**

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Depth of Analysis:**
    *   **Political and Social Context:**  Delve deeper into the political and social context of malaria control in affected countries.  Factors like corruption, instability, lack of infrastructure, and cultural beliefs can significantly impact the effectiveness of control programs.
    *   **Ethical Considerations:**  Consider any ethical considerations. For example, are there equity concerns, and what are potential unintended consequences?
    *   **Economic Impacts:** Elaborate on the positive and negative economic impacts of malaria.  How does the disease affect productivity, healthcare costs, and tourism? How do control programs benefit the economy?

2.  **Counterarguments:**
    *   **U.S. Domestic Needs:** Address the argument that the U.S. has its own domestic needs and health priorities that should take precedence.
    *   **Effectiveness of U.S. Aid:**  Acknowledge the concerns about the effectiveness of foreign aid and the potential for funds to be misused.  Explain how U.S. programs can be designed to minimize waste and ensure accountability.

3.  **More Specific Recommendations:**
    *   **Targeted Interventions:**  Specify what types of anti-malaria programs should receive increased funding (e.g., insecticide-treated nets, drug distribution, research and development, surveillance).
    *   **Collaboration:** Suggest ways the U.S. can improve collaboration with other international organizations, local governments, and community groups.

4.  **Prioritization of Programs:**
    *   **Comparative Analysis:** Go into more detail on the comparative analysis between malaria programs and other health programs like HIV/AIDS and pandemic flu.  What are the specific metrics you are using to compare these programs (e.g., cost per life saved, economic impact, number of people affected)?
    *   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Conduct a more formal cost-benefit analysis of anti-malaria programs versus other health interventions.

5.  **Sentence structure examples**
*   "The successful completion of the sporogonic cycle is dependent upon if the inoculated mosquito survives long enough for the Plasmodium to finish the cycle and if weather conditions are appropriate (hot and humid) for Plasmodium development." could be rewritten as "The successful completion of the sporogonic cycle depends on the inoculated mosquito surviving long enough for Plasmodium to finish its development, and on weather conditions being appropriate (hot and humid) for the parasite."
*   "Impoverished families living in malaria endemic regions may spend up to 25% of their annual income on prevention and treatment of the disease (4). The reduction of the malarial burden will promote a more stable and productive global market (5)." could be rewritten as "Impoverished families in malaria-endemic regions may spend up to 25% of their annual income on prevention and treatment (4), so reducing the malaria burden would promote a more stable and productive global market (5)."

**Other Considerations:**

*   **Update Sources:** Ensure your sources are as up-to-date as possible.  Public health information changes rapidly.
*   **Clarity of Terminology:** Define any technical terms that may not be familiar to a general audience.

**In summary:** This is a well-written and informative paper with a strong central argument. By addressing the areas for improvement, you can elevate the paper to an even higher level of scholarship. Good job!
