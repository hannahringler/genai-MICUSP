Okay, I can give you some feedback on this paper. I'll focus on areas like argumentation, clarity, organization, and style, bearing in mind this is a college-level essay.

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a solid argument about the role of human and animal nature in H.G. Wells' *The Island of Dr. Moreau* and Edgar Allan Poe's "The Black Cat." It effectively compares and contrasts the narrators' perspectives and actions and connects their cruelty to their ultimate downfalls. The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the texts and the relevant themes.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:** The thesis statement is well-defined and the essay stays focused on the core argument throughout.
*   **Textual Evidence:** The paper uses specific examples and quotations from both texts to support its claims.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** The essay effectively compares and contrasts the characters and themes in the two works.
*   **Insightful Observations:** The analysis goes beyond surface-level readings and delves into the characters' motivations and perspectives.
*   **Organization:** The essay is logically organized with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While the argument is clear, there is room to explore the nuances of the themes and characters. Consider delving deeper into the complexities of human/animal nature, especially within each individual work before drawing comparisons.
*   **Counterarguments/Limitations:** Acknowledge and address any counterarguments or limitations to your thesis. This will strengthen your argument and demonstrate critical thinking. For example, you could briefly acknowledge different interpretations of the characters' motivations or the role of societal influences.
*   **Clarity and Specificity:** There are a few instances where the language could be more precise and the connections between ideas could be clarified.
*   **Stylistic Refinements:** While the writing is generally clear, there are opportunities to improve the flow and elegance of the prose.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   The introduction is adequate but could be made more engaging. Consider starting with a broader statement about the exploration of human and animal nature in literature before narrowing down to your specific argument.

*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   **Paragraph 2**: The phrase "malleable, brutish compulsions unworthy of man" is a good start, but unpack this more. What specifically about their idea of "animal nature" is problematic? How do *they* define it, and why is that problematic in the context of the stories?
    *   **Paragraph 3**: "The difference...lies in the feelings each man has" is good, but you could strengthen this by including *why* this difference ultimately matters to your *overall* argument about their downfalls. Connect each paragraph back to your main thesis, and make sure it is extremely apparent why it is there!
    *   **Paragraph 4**: When discussing "perverseness" in Poe, consider how it connects to the theme of free will vs. determinism in the story. Is the narrator truly at the mercy of his impulses, or is he making a choice? This would add a layer of complexity to your analysis.
    *   **Paragraph 5**: Elaborate on the implications of Moreau's self-inflated ego. How does it blind him to the reality of the animal within himself and others? How does it lead to his downfall?
    *   **Paragraph 6**: "His disregard for the potential ramifications of his actions foreshadows his demise." is a bit obvious. How does he disregard them? What assumptions does he make that are proven false?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   While the conclusion summarizes the main points, it could offer a more insightful reflection on the broader implications of the analysis. Consider discussing the enduring relevance of these stories in exploring the complexities of human nature and the dangers of cruelty.
    *   The statement "the men determine their own fates" is somewhat simplistic. While they are responsible for their actions, consider the role of external factors and the limitations of their perspectives.

*   **Minor Stylistic Suggestions:**
    *   **Avoid unnecessary repetition.** Some phrases and ideas are repeated throughout the essay. Try to vary your language and approach.
    *   **"Human-Animal Nature"** Consider if this is the best descriptor for what you are discussing, as it doesn't sound especially like a scholarly term. Is there a better way of phrasing it?

**Overall Score:**

I would rate this paper as a B+ or potentially an A- with some revisions. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the texts and presents a clear argument, but it could be strengthened by adding nuance, addressing counterarguments, and refining the language.

By addressing these suggestions, you can elevate the essay to an even higher level of analysis and argumentation. Good job!
