Okay, here's some feedback on the paper "The Franklin's Tale" and Boccaccio's *Il Filocolo*":

**Overall Impression:**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of both Chaucer's "The Franklin's Tale" and Boccaccio's *Il Filocolo*. The comparison is insightful and well-supported with textual evidence. The argument that Chaucer uses the tale to explore issues of social class, love, and morality, and that he leaves the interpretation open to the audience, is convincing. The paper also effectively highlights the nuances in Chaucer's choices (like naming characters or emphasizing love).

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:**  The paper has a clear thesis statement that provides a roadmap for the analysis.
*   **Solid Textual Support:**  You consistently back up your claims with quotations from both texts. The use of line numbers from "The Franklin's Tale" is helpful.
*   **Good Analysis:** You go beyond simply identifying similarities and differences to analyze *why* those differences exist and what they mean for the overall interpretation of the tales.
*   **Thoughtful Consideration of Context:** You consider the social positions of the narrators and how that might influence their perspectives.
*   **Effective Use of the Middle English Dictionary:** Integrating the nuances of "fre" and "liberal" into the discussion adds depth to the argument about Chaucer's deliberate word choice.
*   **Compelling Conclusion:** The conclusion effectively summarizes the argument and emphasizes Chaucer's progressive approach and invitation to the reader to engage in interpretation.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Refine the Introduction:** The introduction could be strengthened with a slightly more focused thesis statement.  Instead of just stating that the paper will compare the two stories, you could more directly state your key finding. *For example: "Chaucer's adaptation of Boccaccio's Il Filocolo in 'The Franklin's Tale' serves to shift the emphasis from a hierarchical social order based on honor to a more egalitarian perspective that values love and individual agency, ultimately inviting readers to determine which character embodies the truest form of nobility."*
*   **Clarify Connections:** The argument is generally clear, but some transitions between points could be smoother. Make sure each paragraph's topic sentence directly relates back to the main argument.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Naming Conventions:** In the early part of the paper, when discussing naming, elaborate on what the impact of naming certain characters and leaving others unnamed does to the audience.  How does this invite interpretation from the reader?
*   **Consider Further Exploring the Franklin's Motives:** You point out that the Franklin's social climbing may affect the storytelling. It would be very interesting to unpack this more and provide textual evidence for how we see the Franklin's attempt to assert his worth as a gentleman through the story. How does he try to show the values of the middle class through the characters?
*   **Oath discussion:** In the section discussing the validity of the oath, delve deeper into why the Queen might say that the oath cannot be made without her husband's consent. What do such thoughts say about the social expectations and restraints on noblewomen?

**Minor Edits:**

*   "*Il Filocolo*" and "*The Canterbury Tales*" should be in italics.
*   Carefully review all quotations for accuracy and proper formatting.
*   Check for any minor grammar or spelling errors.

**Overall Grade:**

The paper is very strong and likely earns a solid "A." With some revisions focused on tightening the argument, improving transitions, and expanding on specific points, it could be even better.

Good luck!
