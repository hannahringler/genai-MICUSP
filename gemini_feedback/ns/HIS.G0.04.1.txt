Okay, I've reviewed your paper and here's some feedback focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions.

**Overall Impression**

Your paper is a well-organized and thoughtful analysis of Sinclair Lewis's *Arrowsmith* in the context of the history of medicine. You effectively connect the novel's themes to relevant historical sources like Starr's *The Social Transformation of American Medicine* and De Kruif's *Microbe Hunters*. Your argument is clear, and you provide good textual evidence to support your claims.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:** You establish a clear thesis in the introduction about Lewis's portrayal of medicine, its commercialization, and the themes of enthusiasm and ethical concerns.
*   **Strong Evidence and Analysis:** You effectively use quotes from *Arrowsmith*, *Microbe Hunters*, and Starr's book to support your points. You don't just drop quotes; you analyze them and explain their significance.
*   **Good Organization:** The paper follows a logical structure, moving from enthusiasm for medicine to its commercialization, issues of trustworthiness, and ethnocentrism.
*   **Contextualization:** You successfully place the novel within its historical context, showing an understanding of the period's attitudes towards medicine and science.
*   **Critical Thinking:** You demonstrate critical thinking by not just accepting Lewis's portrayal at face value. You point out his potential biases and offer alternative perspectives, such as the role of women in medicine (Morantz-Sanchez).

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While you do offer some counterarguments, consider further exploring the nuances of Lewis's portrayal. For example, you could delve deeper into *why* Lewis might have been so critical of the medical profession. Was it simply cynicism, or was he trying to expose genuine problems?
*   **Deeper Engagement with Secondary Sources:** You use Starr and De Kruif well, but you could push the analysis further. Instead of just using them as supporting evidence, consider engaging with their arguments more directly. Do they agree with each other? Where do they differ? How does Lewis's perspective fit within their broader frameworks?
*   **Refine Thesis:** While your thesis is good, consider making it even more focused. Instead of listing several themes, try to identify the *most* central argument you want to make about Lewis's portrayal.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Consider adding a sentence or two that explicitly states your interpretation of Lewis's purpose in writing the novel. What message was he trying to convey?
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   **Enthusiasm for Medicine:** You could strengthen this section by discussing specific examples of medical advancements during the 1920s that fueled this enthusiasm (e.g., the development of insulin, advances in vaccines).
    *   **Commercialization:** When discussing Pickerbaugh, you could elaborate on the specific ways he commercialized medicine (e.g., his "health reforms," his public persona).
    *   **Trustworthiness:** Expand on why the townspeople were slow to trust Martin. Was it just his being an outsider, or were there other factors at play (e.g., skepticism about modern medicine)?
    *   **Ethnocentrism:** Explore the consequences of this ethnocentrism in medical research and practice. How did it affect the treatment of marginalized communities?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Strengthen the connection between Lewis's critique and his own potential "guilt" of popularizing medicine. How does his novel contribute to the very phenomenon he criticizes?
    *   End with a more impactful concluding statement. What is the lasting significance of *Arrowsmith* and its portrayal of medicine?
*   **Minor Edits:**
    *   "Arrowsmith is a novel based on the dramatic portrayal of a man who passionately devotes his life to scientific research." - Consider rewording this to be more concise and impactful.
    *   "Elements of this ethnocentrism are visible in Arrowhead as well" - Consider rephrasing to "are visible in *Arrowsmith* as well."
    *   (Lewis, 370) Consider including page numbers on the first use of a quote as well as subsequent uses in each paragraph.

**Revised Thesis Example (Consider this an option; your current thesis is also acceptable):**

"While Sinclair Lewis's *Arrowsmith* effectively captures the early 20th-century American public's burgeoning enthusiasm for medicine and scientific advancement, the novel ultimately serves as a cautionary tale, exposing the dangers of commercialization, ethical compromises, and ingrained biases that threaten to undermine the integrity of the medical profession."

**In Summary:**

You've written a solid and insightful paper. By adding more nuance, deepening your engagement with secondary sources, and refining your thesis, you can elevate it to an even higher level. Remember to focus on analyzing *why* things are happening, not just *that* they are happening. Good job!
