Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering various aspects:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis & Clear Argument:** The paper presents a clear, intriguing thesis about the ironic development of Catholic schools from separatist institutions to agents of Americanization. The argument is consistently pursued throughout the paper.
*   **Well-Researched:** The paper demonstrates a good grasp of the historiography of Catholic education, drawing on a wide range of relevant sources, including seminal works by Ravitch, Bryk, Lannie, Lazerson, and others. The bibliography is comprehensive.
*   **Structured & Organized:** The paper is logically organized into sections ("Church and School Triumphant," "Separatism Under Attack," "The Seeds of Americanization"), which help to structure the argument and provide a clear roadmap for the reader.
*   **Engaging & Thought-Provoking:** The paper raises interesting questions about the nature of Catholic schools, their relationship to American society, and the complex interplay of separatism and Americanization.
*   **Historiographical Analysis:** The paper does a good job of not only describing the history of Catholic education but also analyzing how that history has been written and interpreted by different scholars over time.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Further Development of "Third Wave":** While the paper introduces the "Third Wave" perspective, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of this viewpoint.
*   **Nuance & Complexity:** While the paper acknowledges the interplay of separatism and Americanization, it could delve even deeper into the nuances and complexities of this relationship.
*   **Conclusion: Tie up the loose ends, and what it means.** The Conclusion feels a bit like it could summarize more. How can that be achieved?

**Specific Suggestions & Feedback:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   The opening anecdote about John Hughes is effective in grabbing the reader's attention and setting the stage for the argument.
    *   The thesis statement is clear, but could potentially be even more concise and impactful.
*   **Section 1 ("Church and School Triumphant"):**
    *   The discussion of Shea and Burns is well done, effectively capturing the traditionalist perspective.
    *   Consider adding a sentence or two to explicitly link this section to the overall thesis. How does this early focus on triumphalism and separatism contribute to the later irony?
*   **Section 2 ("Separatism Under Attack"):**
    *   The discussion of McCluskey, Lannie, and Cross is strong.
    *   The conclusion of this section, that separatism becomes a "negative thing," is an important turning point in the argument.
*   **Section 3 ("The Seeds of Americanization"):**
    *   This section is somewhat less developed than the previous two. While the discussion of Dolan and Sanders is helpful, it could benefit from more in-depth analysis and examples.
    *   Consider exploring the specific ways in which Catholic schools began to adapt to American culture and society during this period. What curricular changes were made? How did the student body change?
*   **Clarity:** Consider asking someone unfamiliar with your topic to read the paper and provide feedback on its clarity. Is the argument easy to follow? Are the key terms (e.g., separatism, Americanization) clearly defined and consistently used?

*   **Proofreading:** Ensure thorough proofreading for any minor errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that demonstrates a strong understanding of the history and historiography of Catholic education. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, you can further strengthen your argument and enhance the overall impact of your work.
