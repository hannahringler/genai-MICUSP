Okay, I can provide feedback on the paper "Cursed Inheritances."  To give you the most useful feedback, I'll focus on several key areas:

**I. Overall Impression:**

*   The paper presents a clear argument about how William Faulkner represents problems of inheritance in *Go Down, Moses*, focusing on Isaac and McCaslin's contrasting responses to land and family history.
*   The essay shows a good understanding of the novel's complexities and engages with specific textual details.
*   The writing is generally clear and well-organized.

**II. Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The central argument, that the conflict lies in the inheritance of land *and* knowledge and that Isaac's inability to escape family secrets drives his isolation, is well-defined.
*   **Textual Support:** The paper consistently uses quotes from *Go Down, Moses* to support its claims. You effectively integrate these quotes into your analysis.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** You provide thoughtful interpretations of the characters' motivations and actions, particularly regarding Isaac's rejection of the land and Cass's acceptance.
*   **Well-Organized:** The essay follows a logical structure, comparing and contrasting Isaac and Cass's experiences and perspectives.
*   **Understanding of Context:** The paper demonstrates awareness of the historical context of slavery and its impact on the characters' choices.

**III. Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Exploration of Counterarguments/Nuances:** While the paper presents a strong argument, it could benefit from acknowledging and addressing potential counterarguments or nuances. For example:
    *   Could Cass's acceptance of the land be viewed as a form of complicity, rather than simply a pragmatic approach?
    *   Does Isaac's rejection of the land have *any* positive outcomes, or is it purely a form of escape?
*   **Further Development of the "Curse" Metaphor:** The title and concluding remarks suggest a central metaphor of a "cursed inheritance." You could strengthen the paper by explicitly analyzing the significance of this metaphor throughout the novel. What *is* the curse exactly? How does it manifest?
*   **Expand on the "Knowledge" aspect of the conflict:** You state that the conflict is in the inheritance of land "and" knowledge. You do a fantastic job expanding on the inheritance of land, but you can expand on how the inheritance of knowledge truly affects both Isaac and Cass.
*   **Clarity in sentence structure:** There are some points where the sentence structure can be reworked for easier comprehension.

**IV. Specific Suggestions and Examples:**

*   **In the introduction:**
    *   "Complicating this inheritance is the conflict between the inheritance of land and the inheritance of knowledge that affects how one views said land and even how one views family history." You can expand on this slightly to give it more emphasis and provide context to the reader.
*   **"It is clear that the relationship between Cass and Isaac is much different from that of typical cousins."** Be more specific. *How* is it different? This will help set up the following analysis.
*   **"Cass sees himself as tied to both the legacy of the family and of the land itself."** You can expand on this and its relevance to the situation and discussion.
*   **"The overarching legacy of slavery which frames the novel as a whole is highlighted by Isaac's reaction."** This is a good point. You could elaborate on *how* Isaac's reaction highlights this legacy.

**V. Minor Points:**

*   **Proofread Carefully:** Double-check for any minor typos or grammatical errors.
*   **MLA Citations:** Ensure that all citations are in correct MLA format.

**VI. Revised Example of a specific section:**

Here's an example of how you might revise a paragraph to incorporate some of these suggestions (using the "curse" metaphor and adding nuance):

**Original:**

"Accepting his heritage is what Cass sees as the ethical thing to do, not necessarily in spite of but perhaps because of his family history. The act of refusing the land for Isaac, however, represents his attempts to wash his hands of the family secrets."

**Revised:**

"Cass views accepting his heritage as the ethical path, not necessarily in spite of, but perhaps *because* of, his family's deeply flawed history. He recognizes that the "curse" of slavery and injustice is inextricably linked to the land itself. Isaac's refusal to inherit, while seemingly a rejection of this tainted legacy, can also be interpreted as an attempt to wash his hands of the family secrets, a desperate attempt to escape a curse that he ultimately cannot outrun. However, it can also be interpreted as running away from the problem."

**In summary:**

This is a well-written and insightful analysis of *Go Down, Moses*. By addressing the areas for improvement, you can elevate the paper to an even higher level. The core argument is strong; it simply needs further refinement and elaboration. Good job!
