Here's some feedback on the paper "Race and the Frequency of Developing Type II Diabetes," focusing on its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper tackles an interesting and important issue. It correctly identifies the link between race and Type II diabetes prevalence while acknowledging the complex interplay of genetics, social factors, and healthcare disparities. However, the paper could benefit from stronger arguments, more concrete evidence, and improved organization.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevant and Important Topic:** The paper addresses a significant health disparity and its contributing factors.
*   **Awareness of Nuances:** It acknowledges the social construction of race and its potential influence on healthcare.
*   **Good Introduction:** The introduction effectively sets the stage, highlighting the prevalence of diabetes and its disproportionate impact on certain ethnic groups.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Specificity and Evidence:** The paper makes several claims but lacks supporting evidence from academic sources. For example, the statement about pharmaceutical companies spending "billions" would be stronger with a citation.
*   **Argument Development:** The central argument about the limitations of focusing on race needs further development and support. How *exactly* does it hinder research and treatment? Provide more examples.
*   **Organization and Flow:** Some transitions between ideas are abrupt. The paper could be organized more logically, perhaps with clearer sections or headings.
*   **Writing Style:** While generally clear, the writing could be more concise and academic. The phrasing is sometimes informal (e.g., "pigeon-holing").
*   **Missing Conclusion:** The paper ends somewhat abruptly. A conclusion that summarizes the main points and offers a call to action or further research would be beneficial.
*   **Incomplete Citation:** There's an incomplete quote with a "..." in the middle. Complete the quote and cite it properly.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Strengthen Argument with Evidence:**
    *   Support claims with data from peer-reviewed studies, government reports (e.g., CDC), and reputable sources. For example, cite studies that show the specific differences in genetic predispositions to diabetes among different populations.
    *   Provide examples of how focusing on race has led to inappropriate or discriminatory treatment. What specific research or clinical practices have been negatively impacted?
    *   Find data that speaks to how diabetes prevention is currently developed or promoted and what this might look like if genetic variation beyond that of race was considered.

2.  **Clarify Argument:**
    *   State your thesis more explicitly in the introduction. What is the main argument you are making about race and Type II diabetes?
    *   Use topic sentences to clearly introduce the main point of each paragraph.

3.  **Improve Organization:**
    *   Consider using headings and subheadings to structure the paper logically (e.g., "Prevalence of Type II Diabetes," "Genetic Factors," "Social Determinants," "Limitations of Race-Based Approaches," "Alternative Approaches").
    *   Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas.

4.  **Refine Writing Style:**
    *   Use more precise and academic language. Avoid colloquialisms.
    *   Vary sentence structure for readability.
    *   Proofread carefully for grammar and spelling errors.

5.  **Complete Quote and Citations:**
    *   Complete the quote by Calles-Escandon and provide the source (journal article, news report, etc.).
    *   Cite all sources properly using a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).

6.  **Add a Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the main points of the paper.
    *   Reiterate your thesis statement.
    *   Offer a call to action or suggest areas for future research.

**Example Improvements**

*   **Original:** "How biological variation effects diabetes and its onset is of great importance yet comparatively little understanding compared to cultural reasons."
*   **Revised:** "While cultural and socioeconomic factors undoubtedly contribute to diabetes prevalence, a deeper understanding of the biological and genetic variations across different populations is crucial for developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies (Citation)."

*   **Original:** "Because race is a socially created concept and one of great importance and differentiation in the U.S., how it is viewed will greatly play into future research of diabetes."
*   **Revised:** "The socially constructed nature of race, coupled with its profound influence on societal perceptions and healthcare access in the U.S., significantly shapes the landscape of diabetes research and treatment. However, an overreliance on race as a primary determinant can obscure the underlying genetic and environmental factors contributing to the disease (Citation)."

**Overall Grade Estimation:**

The paper, as is, might receive a C to C+. With the suggested improvements, it could be elevated to a B or even a B+.

Remember to consult with your professor or TA for specific grading criteria and expectations for your sociology course. Good luck!
