Here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on its strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions for further development.  This feedback assumes the paper is a literature review or a research proposal based on a literature review.

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Topic:** The paper focuses on a specific and relevant topic: the impact of adoptee status on identity formation in adolescence.
*   **Organized Structure:** The introduction sets the stage, and the body paragraphs logically discuss different aspects and studies related to the topic.
*   **Evidence-Based:** You cite specific research and authors to support your claims, demonstrating a familiarity with the relevant literature.
*   **Critical Engagement:** You don't just summarize research; you also point out limitations, confounding factors, and areas where studies could have been improved.
*   **Identifies Gaps:** The conclusion effectively points out areas where further research is needed, strengthening the justification for further investigation.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   **Stronger Thesis Statement:** The introduction should end with a clear, concise thesis statement that outlines the main argument or purpose of the review. For example: "This literature review will examine the impact of adoptee status on identity formation during adolescence, focusing on factors such as overall adjustment, level of openness in adoptions, and racial/ethnic variations, while also highlighting areas where further research is necessary."
*   **Depth of Analysis:**
    *   **Synthesize, Don't Just Summarize:** While you summarize the findings of individual studies, aim to *synthesize* across studies. Look for common themes, contradictions, and patterns in the research. How do the different studies relate to each other?
    *   **Elaborate on Implications:** Don't just state the limitations of studies; elaborate on *why* those limitations matter. How do they affect the validity of the findings or our understanding of the topic?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   **Reinforce the Significance:** Explicitly state why this area of research is important. How does understanding the impact of adoptee status on identity formation benefit adoptees, families, or society as a whole?
    *   **More Specific Research Suggestions:** While you mention the need for longitudinal studies, consider being more specific about the types of questions such studies should address.
*   **Clarity and Flow:**
    *   **Transitions:** Strengthen the transitions between paragraphs and ideas. Use transition words and phrases to guide the reader through your argument.
    *   **Proofread Carefully:** Watch out for any minor grammatical errors or typos that could distract the reader.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Consider adding a statistic about the challenges faced by adoptees compared to non-adoptees. This can emphasize the importance of research in this area.
*   **Overall Adjustment and Identity:**
    *   Explicitly define the construct of "identity" you are using. Are you referring to Erikson's theory, or another framework?
    *   Discuss the methodological limitations of the Sharma, McGue, and Benson study more thoroughly.
*   **Level of Openness:**
    *   Elaborate on the different types of openness in adoptions. How does "fully disclosed" adoption differ from other forms of openness?
*   **Racial and Ethnic Variations:**
    *   Explore the implications of the Vroegh study's findings that transracial adoptees identified with the same race they were placed as infants. Does this suggest that racial identity is less salient for transracial adoptees, or that adoptive parents can effectively socialize their children into a different racial identity?

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Refine the Thesis:** Write a strong, clear thesis statement that encapsulates the main argument of your paper.
2.  **Revisit the Studies:** Carefully re-read the studies you cited and look for connections, contradictions, and patterns in the findings.
3.  **Synthesize and Analyze:** Write more in-depth analyses that go beyond simply summarizing the results of individual studies. Discuss how the different studies relate to each other and what the overall body of research suggests.
4.  **Revise the Conclusion:** Strengthen your conclusion by reinforcing the significance of the topic, suggesting more specific areas for future research, and summarizing your main findings.
5.  **Proofread:** Carefully proofread the paper for any grammatical errors or typos.

By addressing these areas for improvement, you can strengthen your paper and create a more compelling and insightful analysis of the research on identity formation in adolescent adoptees.
