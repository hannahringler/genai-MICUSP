Here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The paper tackles an important and often overlooked topic: the relationship between Asian Americans and African Americans.  It attempts to address the complexities of this relationship beyond the typical Black/White dynamic.  The paper provides a historical context and touches on relevant stereotypes and societal factors.

**Strengths**

*   **Important Topic:**  The paper addresses a less discussed area of race relations. This is a major strength as it provides a fresh perspective on a complex issue.
*   **Historical Context:** You provide some historical context, particularly related to the "model minority" myth and events like the LA riots.
*   **Use of Sources:** You have a good number of sources, demonstrating an attempt to support your arguments with evidence.
*   **Identifies Key Issues:** The paper correctly identifies several key issues that contribute to tensions between the two groups, including:
    *   Stereotypes
    *   Media representation
    *   Economic factors
    *   Education and affirmative action
    *   Differences in immigration history

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Clarity and Focus:** The central argument of the paper is somewhat unclear.  While you state you'll be "addressing specifically the relations between Asian Americans and African Americans," the *thesis statement* needs to be more specific about *what* you are arguing about that relationship. For example, are you arguing that it's primarily based on historical manipulation, misunderstanding, or competition for resources?
*   **Depth of Analysis:** While you touch on many issues, the analysis often feels superficial. You need to delve deeper into *why* these factors lead to conflict. For example, how exactly does the "model minority" myth cause tension? What specific mechanisms are at play?
*   **Structure and Organization:** The organization could be improved.  The paper jumps between different points without always establishing a clear connection. A stronger organizational structure with topic sentences would significantly improve readability.
*   **Evidence and Support:** While you cite sources, sometimes the connection between the source and your argument is weak.  You need to clearly *explain* how the evidence supports your claims. Avoid simply dropping in citations.
*   **Nuance and Complexity:** Race relations are extremely complex.  The paper could benefit from acknowledging the diversity within both Asian American and African American communities. Are there regional differences? Class differences?  Are there examples of cooperation and solidarity between the two groups?
*   **Grammar and Style:**  There are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that need to be corrected.  Careful proofreading and editing are crucial.

**Specific Suggestions**

1.  **Develop a Clear Thesis:**
    *   Instead of just saying you will "address" the relationship, *state an argument* about the nature of that relationship.
    *   Example: "The historically-rooted tensions between African Americans and Asian Americans are largely a product of the 'divide and conquer' tactics employed by dominant white society, exacerbated by media portrayals, and differing historical contexts of immigration and forced enslavement." (This is just an example; you need to develop your *own* thesis.)

2.  **Strengthen the Argument:**
    *   **Explain Causation:** Go beyond simply stating that stereotypes exist. *Explain* how these stereotypes *directly contribute* to negative interactions or perceptions. For example: "The stereotype of Asian Americans as a 'model minority' can foster resentment within the African American community, as it is often used to implicitly blame African Americans for their struggles, suggesting a lack of effort rather than acknowledging systemic racism."
    *   **Provide Specific Examples:**  Instead of generalizing about media coverage, give specific examples of news stories or portrayals that perpetuate conflict.
    *   **Address Counterarguments:** Briefly acknowledge and refute opposing viewpoints.  For example, "While some argue that economic competition is the primary driver of tension, this perspective overlooks the historical role of racial hierarchies in shaping perceptions and opportunities."

3.  **Improve Organization:**
    *   **Topic Sentences:** Each paragraph should begin with a clear topic sentence that directly relates to the thesis.
    *   **Logical Flow:** Ensure that the paragraphs flow logically from one to the next. Use transition words and phrases to connect ideas.
    *   **Consider the Following Structure:**
        *   **Introduction:** Introduce the topic, state your thesis.
        *   **Historical Context:**  Expand on the history of interactions.
        *   **The "Model Minority" Myth:** Analyze its origins and impact.
        *   **Media Representation:**  Provide specific examples.
        *   **Economic Factors:** Discuss competition and perceived threats.
        *   **Education and Affirmative Action:**  Analyze the conflicts.
        *   **Conclusion:** Summarize your argument and offer concluding thoughts.

4.  **Refine Language and Grammar:**
    *   **Proofread Carefully:**  Read the paper aloud to identify awkward phrasing and grammatical errors.
    *   **Vary Sentence Structure:** Use a mix of simple and complex sentences.
    *   **Use Precise Language:** Avoid vague or ambiguous terms.

5.  **Deepen Research (Optional):**
    *   Consider adding sources that specifically address cooperation and solidarity between African Americans and Asian Americans to present a more balanced view.
    *   Look for sources that provide a more nuanced understanding of the diversity within both communities.

**Example of a revised paragraph:**

**Original:**

"There is a limitation, though, since the race relations between the Whites and colored people are so emphasized that we do not actually take time to think about the race relations between different groups within the category of colored people. Moreover, when such discussions about colored people take place, we tend to associate specifically African Americans as the representative of all colored people."

**Revised:**

"The pervasive focus on Black/White race relations in American discourse often obscures the complex dynamics between other racial minority groups, such as Asian Americans and African Americans. Furthermore, discussions of race often default to African Americans as the representative of all people of color, overlooking the distinct experiences and challenges faced by other groups." (This is more concise and clearly states the limitation of the dominant race narrative).

**In conclusion:** You've chosen a compelling topic, but this paper needs significant revision to clarify the argument, deepen the analysis, improve organization, and refine the writing style.  Focusing on these areas will greatly strengthen the impact of your work.
