Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of existentialism and applies it effectively to Ralph Ellison's *Invisible Man*. The analysis is insightful, and the argument is generally well-structured. The writing is clear and academic, showing a strong grasp of literary analysis.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The paper establishes a clear thesis (that the protagonist's journey is an existential one) and consistently supports it throughout the analysis.
*   **Solid Understanding of Existentialism:** The paper accurately defines key concepts of existentialism (freedom, choice, absurdity, self-invention) and connects them convincingly to the novel.
*   **Strong Textual Support:** The paper provides ample evidence from the novel to support its claims, using quotations effectively.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The analysis of specific scenes, like the battle royal and the confrontation with Ras, is insightful and contributes to the overall argument.
*   **Well-Organized Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, moving from general principles to specific examples and back again.
*   **Clear and Academic Writing:** The paper uses appropriate academic language and avoids colloquialisms.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Repetitive Introductions of Existentialism:** While understanding is strong, the constant introduction of existential elements within the paper seems repetitive.
*   **Uneven Pace:** The paper is stronger in its analysis of certain sections (e.g., the Ras encounter) than others. Some sections feel rushed or underdeveloped.
*   **Potential for Deeper Engagement:** While the analysis is solid, there's room for even deeper engagement with the complexities of the novel and the philosophical concepts. Consider exploring potential counterarguments or nuances.
*   **Limited Exploration of Context:** While you mention Ellison's biography, you could further explore the historical and social context of the novel. How does the protagonist's race inform his existential struggle?

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Refine the Thesis:** Your thesis is strong, but consider refining it to be even more specific. For example, instead of just saying the novel is an existential *bildungsroman*, you could focus on the specific *kind* of existential freedom the protagonist achieves and the *process* through which he achieves it.

2.  **Streamline Introductions and Transitions:** You don't need to define existentialism in every paragraph. Instead, assume your reader has a basic understanding of the concepts and focus on applying them to the text. Use stronger transition sentences to connect your ideas and guide the reader through your argument.

3.  **Develop the Sections on Early Events Further:** Expand on your analysis of the battle royal and other early events in the novel. How do these experiences shape the protagonist's developing sense of self and his understanding of the world? What specific philosophical principles are illustrated in these moments?

4.  **Engage More Deeply with Complexity:** Consider exploring the complexities and contradictions within the novel. Are there moments when the protagonist's choices are ambiguous or problematic? Does the novel offer a fully optimistic view of existential freedom, or are there limitations? Addressing these complexities will strengthen your argument.

5.  **Address the Socio-Political Context:** Given the historical and social context of the novel, consider discussing the relationship between existentialism and the protagonist's race. Does his racial identity complicate his existential struggle? How does the novel critique or challenge dominant social structures?

6.  **Strengthen the Conclusion:** Ensure your conclusion avoids simply restating the thesis. Instead, use it to synthesize your arguments, offer a final insight about the novel, or suggest implications for further study.

**Specific Examples for Revision**

*   **Introduction:** Shorten the initial listing of existentialist thinkers. Instead, choose one or two key figures whose ideas are most relevant to your analysis and focus on their contributions.

*   **Battle Royal:** Don't just describe the events of the battle royal. Analyze how the protagonist's actions and reactions in this scene reflect his pre-existentialist mindset. What specific choices does he make, and what do they reveal about his character?

*   **Confrontation with Ras:** Expand on your analysis of the protagonist's use of the word "absurd." How does this word encapsulate his newfound understanding of the world? How does it empower him to resist Ras's demands?

**Final Remarks**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that demonstrates a strong understanding of existentialism and its application to *Invisible Man*. By addressing the weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions above, you can elevate the paper to an even higher level. Good job!
