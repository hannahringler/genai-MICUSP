Okay, I've reviewed the paper and here's some feedback, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles an important and complex issue: tracking in schools.  The thesis is clear and the argument is generally well-structured. The paper demonstrates an understanding of the topic and incorporates some relevant research. However, it could benefit from more in-depth analysis, stronger evidence, and refinement in its writing style.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis statement is clearly articulated in the first paragraph, making the argument of the paper easy to understand.
*   **Organization:** The paper follows a logical progression, beginning with a general introduction to tracking, presenting the thesis, discussing arguments against tracking, and offering an example of how tracking is implemented.
*   **Use of Sources:** The paper incorporates research and quotes from relevant sources (Oakes, Noguera, Rist). This demonstrates engagement with the existing literature.
*   **Important Topic:** The paper addresses a significant issue in education with serious implications for equity and student achievement.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Evidence and Analysis:** The paper relies heavily on a few sources. The arguments would be more compelling with a broader range of evidence and more in-depth analysis of the existing research. For example, while you cite Oakes, you could delve deeper into her findings and explain *why* homogeneous grouping is often ineffective.
*   **Generalizations and Lack of Specificity:** Some statements are broad and lack specific examples.  For instance, "upper class and middle class students are placed in the upper tracks filled with an environment of high achievement."  How does this environment differ from lower tracks? Be specific.
*   **Potential Bias/Lack of Counterarguments:** The paper presents a strongly negative view of tracking. While this is a valid stance, acknowledging potential counterarguments and addressing them could strengthen the overall argument. What are the purported benefits of tracking, and why are they not as significant as the drawbacks?
*   **Writing Style:** The writing is generally clear, but it could be more concise and impactful. Some sentences are a bit awkward.
*   **Conclusion:** There isn't a concluding paragraph that reiterates the thesis, sums up the main points, and suggests further research or action.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Expand the Evidence Base:**
    *   Include more research from different perspectives on tracking. Explore studies that support or refute the arguments presented.
    *   Look for statistical data on the achievement gaps created or widened by tracking.
    *   Consider studies on the social and emotional effects of tracking on students.

2.  **Deepen the Analysis:**
    *   Go beyond simply stating that tracking is ineffective. Explain *why* it is ineffective. What are the specific mechanisms through which it harms students in lower tracks? How does it limit their opportunities?
    *   Analyze the root causes of tracking. Why do schools continue to use this system despite its drawbacks? What are the institutional pressures that perpetuate it?
    *   Consider the intersection of tracking with race, class, and other social categories. How does tracking reinforce existing inequalities?

3.  **Address Counterarguments:**
    *   Research and acknowledge the potential benefits of tracking, such as allowing advanced students to progress at a faster pace or providing targeted support for struggling students.
    *   Explain why these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks or why they could be achieved through alternative methods.

4.  **Provide Specific Examples:**
    *   Instead of just saying that upper tracks have "an environment of high achievement," describe specific aspects of that environment, such as more challenging curriculum, more experienced teachers, or more resources.
    *   Provide concrete examples of how the "social facts" teachers receive in kindergarten might unfairly influence their perceptions of students.

5.  **Refine Writing Style:**
    *   Use more active voice.
    *   Vary sentence structure to improve flow.
    *   Proofread carefully for grammar and spelling errors.

6.  **Add a Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the main points of the paper and reiterate the thesis in a fresh way.
    *   Suggest potential solutions to the problem of tracking, such as detracking initiatives, universal preschool, or more equitable funding for schools.
    *   Offer a call to action or suggest further research on the topic.

7.  **Develop your introduction.**
    * Start with a hook to grab the readers attention.
    * Provide a concise overview of what the paper will be about.

**Example Revision (Introduction):**

"In American schools, a silent sorting system shapes the academic trajectories of students from a young age: tracking. While seemingly designed to tailor education to individual needs, this practice of grouping students based on perceived ability has become a powerful engine of inequality. This paper argues that tracking, far from benefiting all students, perpetuates a system of discrimination that disproportionately disadvantages students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, limiting their opportunities and hindering their potential. By examining the research on tracking, its inherent biases, and its impact on student outcomes, this paper demonstrates that the benefits of tracking are heavily outweighed by its profound social costs, highlighting the urgent need for more equitable and effective approaches to education."

**Final Thoughts:**

This is a good start to an important discussion. By strengthening the evidence, deepening the analysis, and refining the writing, you can create a more persuasive and impactful paper. Good luck!
