Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, along with feedback and suggestions:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a clear argument that the new Green Revolution, despite its noble intentions, needs careful consideration due to the potential negative impacts based on the original Green Revolution's experiences and the complexities of world hunger.  The paper is well-organized and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic.  The use of sources is generally good. However, there are some areas where it can be improved in terms of depth, nuance, and clarity.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:** The central argument, that the new Green Revolution needs careful evaluation due to potential negative consequences, is clearly stated and maintained throughout the paper.
*   **Organization:** The structure is logical: introduction, examination of the original Green Revolution, analysis of Rosset's arguments, and a conclusion with recommendations.
*   **Use of Sources:**  The paper incorporates relevant sources (FAO, Stiglitz, Rosset, and "Africa's Turn") to support its claims.
*   **Critical Thinking:** The paper critically examines the assumptions behind the new Green Revolution and raises important questions about its potential impact on developing nations.
*   **Concise and Focused:** The writing is generally concise and avoids unnecessary jargon.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Analysis of the "Africa's Turn" source**:
    *   The paper cites "Africa's Turn" but it isn't clearly defined what this source is and what specific position it is taking. Providing a bit more context around this source would strengthen the analysis. Is it a policy document from the Gates or Rockefeller Foundation? Is it a report from an independent think tank?
*   **Elaboration on Negative Impacts:**
    *   The paper mentions the increased gap between rich and poor, job losses due to mechanization, and farmers going into debt. While these points are valid, expanding on *how* these consequences unfold in detail would make the argument more persuasive. Provide specific examples or scenarios.
*   **Nuance and Counterarguments:**
    *   While the paper focuses on potential negative aspects, acknowledging potential benefits or counterarguments would enhance its credibility. For example, you could discuss potential benefits from increased yields in specific regions where food security is a major issue. You could then address why those potential benefits might not outweigh the potential negative consequences.
*   **Clarity on Rosset's Arguments:**
    *   The paper mentions Rosset's argument that "even most 'hungry countries' have enough food for all their people." While this is a key point, it needs more explanation. What are the distribution problems? Is food being wasted? Is it being exported while local populations are hungry? Providing this context will clarify his claim and strengthen the argument.
*   **Specificity of Recommendations:**
    *   The recommendations are somewhat general ("revisit the original Green Revolution," "proceed without any outside agendas"). While valid, they could be more specific. For example:
        *   Instead of just saying "revisit the original Green Revolution," you could suggest specific aspects to examine (e.g., "examine the impact of subsidized fertilizer programs on small farmers' debt levels").
        *   Instead of "proceed without any outside agendas," you could suggest "ensure that the new Green Revolution prioritizes the needs of local farmers over the interests of multinational corporations, through policies such as fair trade agreements or support for local seed banks."
*   **Citation Style:** Ensure consistent citation style (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago) throughout the paper.

**Specific Suggestions and Questions:**

*   **Introduction:** Consider adding a sentence or two that briefly outlines the specific aspects of the new Green Revolution you will be evaluating.
*   **Original Green Revolution:** Provide specific examples of countries affected by the original Green Revolution and the outcomes they experienced (both positive and negative).
*   **Mechanization:** Explain *why* mechanization leads to job losses and debt.  Who benefits from the increased mechanization, and how? What are the alternative approaches?
*   **Rosset's Arguments:** Elaborate on the reasons *why* "even most 'hungry countries' have enough food." What are the systemic issues that prevent food from reaching those who need it?
*   **"Outside Agendas":** Be more specific about what you mean by "outside agendas." Are you concerned about the influence of specific corporations or political interests?
*   **Holistic Approach:** What does a "holistic and careful approach" look like in practice? Give some concrete examples.
*   **Conclusion:** End with a strong statement that summarizes your argument and leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the new Green Revolution.

**Revised Example Snippets (Illustrative):**

*   **Original:** "The Gates and Rockefeller Foundations cite the original revolution as a model to follow, writing “The results were as massive as they were unprecedented” (Africa's Turn 1)."
*   **Revised:** "The Gates and Rockefeller Foundations cite the original Green Revolution as a model, highlighting the dramatic increases in crop yields in countries like India and Mexico (Africa's Turn 1).  However, this perspective overlooks the less-publicized consequences, such as..." (then continue with your points).  You'd also need to define "Africa's Turn" here.

*   **Original:** "Increasing yields will not increase farmers' livelihoods, as more production exacerbates the current problem of very low food prices (Food is Different)."
*   **Revised:** "Increasing yields, while seemingly beneficial, may actually decrease farmers' livelihoods by contributing to a surplus that drives down food prices on the global market (Rosset, *Food is Different*).  This is because many developing nations are already experiencing a situation where supply exceeds demand, not because there is a lack of food, but because..." (explain distribution issues here).

**To summarize, focus on:**

1.  **Adding Depth:**  Provide more specific examples and details to support your claims.
2.  **Addressing Counterarguments:** Acknowledge potential benefits or alternative perspectives.
3.  **Clarifying Recommendations:** Make your recommendations more concrete and actionable.
4.  **Clearly defining and contextualizing all sources.**

By addressing these points, you can elevate your paper from a good critique to a more compelling and insightful analysis. Good luck!
