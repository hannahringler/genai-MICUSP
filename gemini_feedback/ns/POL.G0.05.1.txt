Okay, I've read through the paper and will provide feedback focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.  I'll concentrate on argument clarity, structure, evidence, and overall effectiveness.

**Overall Impression**

The paper tackles a complex and important issue (the right level of choice in education) and shows a nuanced understanding of the debate. The author demonstrates critical thinking and avoids simplistic solutions.  The writing is generally clear and academic in tone. The paper shows the author's good understanding of the issue, but there are still ways to strengthen its impact and improve its clarity.

**Strengths**

*   **Nuanced Argument:** The paper avoids taking a simplistic position and acknowledges the complexities and trade-offs involved in curricular choice. It recognizes the potential benefits and drawbacks of both tracking and de-tracking.
*   **Critical Thinking:** The author engages with different perspectives (e.g., the "College Republican," the "choice advocate") and anticipates potential counterarguments.
*   **Use of Evidence:** The paper cites relevant research and scholarly sources (Rist, Oakes, Rosenbaum, Skitka) to support its claims.
*   **Clear Structure (Generally):** The paper has a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction clearly states the central question and the author's intention to argue for a middle ground.
*   **Awareness of Socioeconomic Factors:** The paper clearly highlights how social and economic background intersects with education-related choices.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**

*   **Specificity of Proposed Solution:** While the paper argues for a middle ground, the specific details of *how* to implement this middle ground remain somewhat vague. The suggestion to invest in academic advising is good, but it needs further elaboration. What would this advising look like in practice? What specific guidance would advisors provide? How would the core requirements be determined?

*   **Development of Counterarguments:** While counterarguments are acknowledged, they could be more fully developed. For example, the paper mentions the argument that choice keeps potential dropouts in school. Explaining the merits of this side more clearly, before refuting it, would create a stronger paper.

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** There are a few instances where the writing could be more concise and direct. For example, the first paragraph, while setting the stage, could be tightened.

*   **Strengthening the Conclusion:** The conclusion is a bit weak. It summarizes the argument, but could be more impactful by offering a stronger concluding thought or a call to action (even if it's just a call for further research or discussion).
*   **Integrating Evidence:** While evidence is present, at times it feels somewhat "dropped in." The paper could benefit from a more seamless integration of the evidence into the author's own arguments. Explain more specifically how the evidence supports the point being made. Don't just cite; *analyze*.

**Specific Suggestions**

1.  **Elaborate on the "Middle Ground":**
    *   Provide concrete examples of what core requirements would look like. What specific skills or knowledge would be assessed in the exit exam?
    *   Describe how the academic advising system would work in detail. How would advisors be trained? How would they balance the needs of individual students with the goals of the school and society?
    *   Consider addressing potential challenges or limitations of the proposed solution. What are some potential obstacles to implementing this system?

2.  **Deepen the Analysis of Counterarguments:**
    *   When presenting counterarguments, give them a fair hearing before refuting them. For example, when discussing the argument that choice keeps dropouts in school, explain the logic behind this argument more fully. What are the potential benefits of keeping students in school, even if they are not fully engaged?
    *   Consider exploring the potential unintended consequences of the proposed solution. For example, could increased academic advising lead to increased bureaucracy or a loss of student autonomy?

3.  **Refine the Integration of Evidence:**
    *   After citing a source, explicitly explain how the evidence supports your argument. For example, after citing Rist's study, explain how the findings demonstrate the potential for bias in tracking.
    *   Use quotations sparingly. Paraphrase when possible, and focus on summarizing the key findings of the research.

4.  **Strengthen the Conclusion:**
    *   Reiterate the central argument in a clear and concise manner.
    *   Offer a concluding thought that leaves the reader with something to consider. This could be a call for further research, a suggestion for policy changes, or a reflection on the broader implications of the issue.

5.  **Tighten Up Language:**
    *   Review the paper for instances of wordiness or awkward phrasing. Aim for clarity and conciseness in your writing.

**Example of Improvement (Integrating Evidence):**

**Original:**

> Rist found that the criteria used by kindergarten teachers to sort students into...

**Revised:**

> Rist (1970) found that kindergarten teachers, influenced by factors beyond academic potential, sorted students into groups.  His research suggests that these early placements, influenced by things such as cleanliness and perceived family background, rather than IQ scores, create tracks that perpetuate social inequalities from a very early age.

**In summary:**

This is a well-reasoned and thoughtful paper that demonstrates a strong understanding of the complexities of curricular choice. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above, the author can further strengthen the argument, improve its clarity, and increase its overall impact. Good job!
