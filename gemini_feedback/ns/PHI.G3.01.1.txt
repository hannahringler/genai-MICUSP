Okay, I've reviewed the paper and here's some feedback, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and structure.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles a complex and nuanced topic in Hume's philosophy. The central argument – that Hume's treatment of "pretended ideas" is more sophisticated than a simple dismissal of them as meaningless, and that he leverages different strategies depending on the specific pretended idea – is interesting and potentially insightful.  The paper demonstrates a strong grasp of Hume's texts and a willingness to engage with challenging interpretive issues.

However, the paper is also quite dense and could benefit from significant revisions to improve its clarity and accessibility. The writing style is often convoluted, and the argument sometimes gets lost in the details. The paper also has an issue of sometimes assuming that the reader is more familiar with Hume's work than they might be.

**Specific Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarity and Accessibility:**

    *   **Simplify Sentence Structure:** Many sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to parse. Break them down into shorter, more manageable units.
    *   **Define Key Terms More Explicitly:** While you understand Hume's terminology, the reader may not. Provide clear definitions of key terms like "pretended idea," "insignificant," and "impression" early on and reiterate them as needed.
    *   **Use More Signposting:** Guide the reader through your argument with clear signposts (e.g., "In this section, I will argue...", "This shows that...", "However, this raises the question of..."). This will help them follow the logical flow of your reasoning.
    *   **Provide More Concrete Examples:** Abstract arguments can be difficult to grasp. Illustrate your points with more concrete examples from Hume's texts or from everyday experience.
    *   **Avoid Jargon:** When possible, avoid unnecessarily technical language. Aim for clear and concise prose.

2.  **Argumentation:**

    *   **Strengthen the Central Thesis:** While the paper has a central argument, it could be stated more explicitly and forcefully at the beginning and reinforced throughout. Make it very clear to the reader what you are trying to prove.
    *   **Address Counterarguments More Fully:** While you acknowledge some potential objections, consider engaging with them more thoroughly. For instance, the footnote about the potential circularity of grounding change in experience could be expanded into a more substantive discussion.
    *   **Clarify the Relationship Between Sections:** Make sure the connection between each of the sections is clear. Explain why you are going through the ideas in the way that you are. In what way does discussing "body" help you to better understand "substance" or "necessary connection?"

3.  **Structure:**

    *   **Introduction:** The introduction is a good start, but you can improve it by making the central thesis and the paper's structure (what you will be going through to argue for that thesis) more explicit and easier to grasp.
    *   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is a bit weak. It primarily summarizes what you've done. Instead, it should restate your main thesis in light of the arguments you've made and offer some concluding thoughts about the significance of your findings.  Why does this nuanced understanding of Hume's "pretended ideas" matter?
    *   **Organization Within Sections:** Within each section, ensure a clear and logical flow of ideas. Use headings and subheadings to delineate different parts of your argument.

4. **Specific Points to Consider:**

   *   **"That's Some Fancy Thinkin':"** Consider if this is the title you want for this paper. It doesn't give much information about the paper, which makes it hard to know what the paper is about until you read the introduction.
    *   **Author of the Abstract:** The discussion of whether Hume wrote the Abstract is a bit of a distraction. Unless it's crucial to your argument, consider omitting it or moving it to a footnote.
    *   **The Dilemma:** The dilemma you present in the introduction is a good way to frame the issue, but make sure it's crystal clear to the reader why this is a *problem* for Hume's philosophy. Why can't he simply dismiss pretended ideas as meaningless?
    *   **Body Section:** In section 2, you state that Hume "almost never suggests that we have a merely pretended idea of" body. Consider exploring how it is that Hume can suppose that we have an idea of body (as opposed to our 'fancy') without it having a resembling impression.
    *   **Footnotes:** Some of the footnotes (e.g., the one about the idea of simplicity) could be integrated into the main text.

**Example of Revision (Introduction):**

Here's a suggested revision of the introduction to illustrate how to improve clarity and conciseness:

> "In *A Treatise of Human Nature*, David Hume frequently employs a destructive semantic strategy against metaphysical objects. He argues that terms lacking corresponding impressions are 'insignificant' and thus, according to his 'fourth corollary', we can never have reason to believe that any object exists of which we cannot form an idea. This approach seems straightforward, but it generates a dilemma: If we genuinely lack ideas of metaphysical objects like substance or necessary connection, why does Hume spend so much effort arguing against them? Are we disabusing ourselves of ideas we do not even have? Or, if we *do* have ideas of these objects, where do they come from, given Hume's empiricist commitments?
>
>This paper argues that Hume's treatment of 'pretended ideas' is more nuanced than a simple dismissal. It identifies two distinct argumentative strategies. For some ideas (such as the modern notion of body), Hume argues that the terms are circular and therefore meaningless. For others (such as the idea of body as an external substance), Hume argues that while the ideas *do* have content derived from experience, they are the products of the imagination and should not be trusted. This paper will focus on substance and necessary connection, examining how these ideas have both legitimate experiential content and yet are subject to Humean critique. It will show how Hume's approach allows him to both argue against these ideas and, at times, suggest that we lack them altogether."

**In summary:**

This is a well-researched and thoughtful paper with a promising thesis. By focusing on clarity, argumentation, and structure, you can significantly enhance its impact and make it more accessible to a wider audience.
