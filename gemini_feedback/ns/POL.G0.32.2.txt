Here's some feedback on the paper "The Blocking Machine":

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Focus:** The paper clearly focuses on how the "Blocking Machine" ad uses specific techniques to portray Daschle negatively and appeal to a conservative base.
*   **Strong Use of Evidence:** The analysis is well-supported with specific details from the ad, including the visuals, narration, and references to other political figures.
*   **Good Use of Theory:** The application of theoretical concepts like condensation symbols and Kaid and Davidson's Videostyle framework strengthens the analysis.
*   **Well-Structured:** The paper follows a logical progression, building the argument step-by-step.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Some sentences and paragraphs could be more concise and direct. Sometimes the writing feels a bit dense.
*   **Elaboration on Theoretical Concepts:** While you introduce concepts like "condensation symbols," consider elaborating slightly on *how* they function psychologically or socially.
*   **Nuance and Counterarguments:**  While the paper strongly argues the ad's effectiveness in swaying conservatives, acknowledging potential counterarguments or limitations of the analysis could enhance its depth.
*   **Sentence Variation:** Vary sentence structure and avoid repeated sentence structures.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Consider adding a sentence or two that provide a broader context about political advertising and its impact on elections.
*   **"The Blocking Machine" Explanation:** After introducing "The Blocking Machine", explain what the aim of the ad is.
*   **Grammar Check:** Proofread carefully for any minor errors in grammar or punctuation.
*   **Specificity with "Condensation Symbols":** Instead of just stating that Kennedy, Clinton, and Boxer are Condensation Symbols, explain *why* they evoke these particular associations for the intended audience (e.g., perceived liberal values, coastal elite status, etc.).

**Overall, this is a well-researched and insightful analysis of the "Blocking Machine" ad. By addressing the areas for improvement, you can further enhance the clarity, depth, and persuasiveness of your argument.**
