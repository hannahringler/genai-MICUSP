Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions for how to enhance the overall argument and clarity:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a clear argument about the complex relationship between Germanicus and Tiberius, arguing that Germanicus's popularity and potential threat to Tiberius led to a situation that ultimately resulted in Germanicus's death (with varying degrees of Tiberius's direct involvement being suggested). The use of primary source material is good, and the writing is generally clear.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:** The thesis is understandable from the beginning and is generally maintained throughout the paper.  The paper focuses on a specific point: the threat Germanicus posed to Tiberius.
*   **Good Use of Primary Sources:** You use quotes from Tacitus and Suetonius to support your claims. The quotations are generally relevant and helpful.
*   **Logical Organization:** The paper follows a generally chronological order, which helps to follow the narrative of the relationship between Germanicus and Tiberius.
*   **Understanding of the Historical Context:** You demonstrate an understanding of the political climate of the early Roman Empire and the importance of popularity with the army and the Roman people.
*   **Balanced Perspective:** You acknowledge different interpretations and possible motivations for actions, even when presenting your primary argument. For instance, you present multiple theories about why Germanicus excluded his name from the inscription.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Thesis Nuance/Specificity:** While the overall argument is clear, the *specific* way in which Germanicus's popularity became a "threat" to Tiberius could be articulated more precisely in the introduction.  Was it a direct threat of usurpation, or a more subtle threat of diminishing Tiberius's power and influence?  Adding that specificity would strengthen the thesis.
*   **Analysis vs. Summary:** In some places, the paper tends to summarize events rather than deeply analyze their significance. Aim to *interpret* the sources, drawing out implicit meanings.
*   **Connecting the Dots More Explicitly:** While you present evidence, the connection between the evidence and your central argument isn't always as strong as it could be.  Make sure to explicitly *explain* how each piece of evidence supports your thesis.
*   **Counterarguments/Alternative Perspectives:** Briefly acknowledging and refuting alternative interpretations could strengthen your argument. For example, were there any historians who viewed Tiberius's actions towards Germanicus as benevolent or strategically sound? Briefly address and refute this.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is a bit repetitive. It summarizes the main points well enough but could offer a more insightful reflection on the broader significance of this historical conflict. Does the story of Germanicus and Tiberius offer any valuable lessons about power, succession, or political maneuvering that are still relevant today?

**Specific Suggestions & Examples:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Instead of just saying Germanicus was in an "ideal position to become a future emperor," explain *why* that position made him a threat to Tiberius specifically. What were Tiberius's insecurities or vulnerabilities that Germanicus's position exploited?
*   **Analysis of Tacitus and Suetonius:**
    *   When quoting Tacitus' description of Germanicus's funeral, explain *how* this depiction emphasizes the virtues that made him popular and a potential threat to Tiberius. What specific aspects of the description contrast with Tiberius's image or known characteristics?
    *   When you state, "News of these successes was arguably worrisome to Tiberius," elaborate on *why* these successes were worrisome.  What specific fears or anxieties might they have triggered in Tiberius?
*   **Germanicus in Egypt:**
    *   You clearly explain why Egypt was important. However, what were the *actual steps* that Germanicus took in Egypt that were percieved as potentially challenging Tiberius' authority? What did it mean for Germanicus to "gain supporters" in Egypt?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Move beyond summarizing your argument and instead reflect on the broader implications of the Germanicus-Tiberius relationship. What does it teach us about the dynamics of power in the Roman Empire? Or about the challenges of succession?

**Revised Example (Analysis vs. Summary):**

**Original:**

>   Germanicus was born in 15 B.C. to Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, and Antonia Minor. In 4 B.C., Augustus ordered his successor, Tiberius, to adopt Germanicus. At this point, Augustus, who was reaching the end of his life and reign, is said to have been persuaded by his cunning wife, Livia into appointing his adopted son, Tiberius, as his heir to the throne. By ordering Tiberius to adopt Germanicus as his son, Augustus was making it known that he intended for Germanicus to be next in line, after Tiberius, for the heir to the throne.

**Revised (More Analytical):**

>   Germanicus's lineage and adoption further complicated Tiberius's position.  Born in 15 B.C. to Drusus (Tiberius's brother) and Antonia Minor, Germanicus was already connected to the imperial family. Augustus's decree in 4 B.C., compelling Tiberius to adopt Germanicus, went beyond simply securing the succession; it served as a tacit endorsement of Germanicus as Tiberius's *eventual* successor. This act, orchestrated by Augustus and potentially influenced by Livia's machinations to ensure Tiberius's initial ascendance, placed Germanicus in a position of inherited legitimacy that could, and ultimately did, overshadow Tiberius's own claim to power.

**In Summary:**

The paper has a solid foundation and demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context. By focusing on more in-depth analysis, explicitly connecting the evidence to your main argument, and adding a more insightful conclusion, you can elevate the paper to a higher level. Good luck!
