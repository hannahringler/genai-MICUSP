Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering its strengths and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of both *Doctor Faustus* and *The Tempest* and offers an interesting comparison of the protagonists' relationship to power and magic. The argument is generally well-structured, and the writing is clear, albeit with some areas needing refinement. It's evident that the author has invested time in analyzing the texts.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis statement (end of the first paragraph) clearly outlines the essay's central argument: that both Faustus and Prospero share intellectual desires for magic and power but differ in their ultimate choices (Faustus embracing diabolic power, Prospero renouncing his art for humanism).
*   **Strong Textual Support:** The essay consistently backs up its claims with relevant quotations from both plays. This shows close reading and a solid grasp of the material.
*   **Well-Organized Argument:** The essay follows a logical structure, comparing Faustus and Prospero's initial desires, their struggles with power, and their eventual choices.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The essay offers some insightful observations, such as the interpretation of Mephastophilis's explanation of hell and the exploration of Faustus's internal conflict in his final soliloquy.
*   **Good Understanding of Themes:** The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the plays' central themes, including the pursuit of knowledge, the dangers of unchecked power, and the conflict between humanism and ambition.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Specificity and Nuance:** While the overall argument is clear, some sections could benefit from more specific analysis.
    *   **Example:** When discussing the similarities between Barabas and Shylock, expand briefly on the *specific* ways they are ridiculed, or *specific* Christian counterparts of each character.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** There are some sentences and phrases that could be more concise and direct.
    *   **Example:** "The similarities are too obvious to be overlooked, however, these two characters also demonstrate differences in their humanity—whereas Barabas seeks the power that accompanies wealth, Shylock desires respect of the Venetians." This sentence is a little clunky. Consider breaking it up or rephrasing for clarity.
*   **Flow and Transitions:** While the essay is generally well-organized, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Use transition words or phrases to clearly signal the connection between ideas.
    *   **Example:** The transition between the discussion of Prospero's books and the mention of Gonzalo could be strengthened by explicitly stating how the books represent power.
*   **Avoid Overgeneralizations/Overstatements:**
    *   **Example:** "The two stories diverge from the seemingly similar plot structures they portray, and in the end, produce original works that are reminiscent of each other while still maintaining their own authentic complexities."  This sentence is a bit vague.  What plot structures are you referring to?  What are the "authentic complexities"?
    *   **Example:** "...Marlowe demonstrates to the reader that Faustus is disinclined to ‘abjure his magic' because of the amount of pleasure he receives from it..." While pleasure is *a* reason, it might be overstating the case to suggest it is *the* reason.
*   **Consider Counterarguments/Limitations:** While the essay makes a strong case for its interpretation, acknowledging potential counterarguments or limitations could strengthen it further. For instance, is there any evidence that Faustus *does* have a moment of genuine repentance? Does Prospero *ever* display any flaws in his "humanism?"
*   **Minor Edits:** Proofread carefully for minor errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** While the opening with Barabas and Shylock is an interesting parallel, it might be more effective to start directly with the comparison of Faustus and Prospero, especially since the essay's focus is primarily on those two characters. The reference feels a bit tangential to the main argument.
*   **Paragraph 2:** Elaborate on the *specific* liberal arts that Prospero studies. This would strengthen the connection to his later magical abilities.
*   **Paragraph 3:** This section comparing Faustus to Prospero needs more discussion of the contrast. Consider discussing how Prospero *uses* the spirits under his command.
*   **Paragraph 4:** "Shakespeare illustrates to the reader that the magic in which Prospero gains is unlike Faustus,' and that his religious morality is still intact."  Needs work. Perhaps change to: "...and that Prospero's morality remains intact despite his use of magic."
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is solid but could be made stronger by reiterating the significance of the comparison. Why does it matter that Faustus and Prospero respond differently to power? What broader insights does this offer about the plays or the human condition?

**How to Improve:**

1.  **Refine Analysis:** Reread the essay and identify areas where you can provide more specific examples and explanations.
2.  **Strengthen Transitions:** Add transition words or phrases to connect ideas and improve the flow of the essay.
3.  **Proofread Carefully:** Check for errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
4.  **Consider Counterarguments:** Think about potential objections to your argument and address them in the essay.
5.  **Revise for Clarity:** Eliminate any unnecessary words or phrases and rephrase sentences that are unclear or awkward.

By addressing these points, you can further refine your essay and make it even more compelling and insightful. Good luck!
