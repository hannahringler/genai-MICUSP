Okay, I can provide some feedback on this essay.  Here's a breakdown of strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and style.

**Overall Impression**

The essay demonstrates a solid understanding of postcolonial literature and the complex relationship between history, memory, and identity.  It offers an interesting comparison of Walcott's *Omeros* and Coetzee's *Waiting for the Barbarians*, using these texts to explore how history is constructed and contested, particularly in the context of colonialism. The writing is generally competent, but there are areas where clarity and precision could be improved.

**Strengths**

*   **Strong Thesis/Central Argument:** The essay clearly establishes its focus on the interplay of history and memory in postcolonial literature through the works of Walcott and Coetzee.

*   **Relevant Textual Analysis:** The essay uses specific examples from the novels to support its points. Quotes are appropriately selected and integrated.

*   **Engagement with Theory:** The essay demonstrates familiarity with key theorists like Walter Benjamin and Edward Said, effectively using their concepts to frame the analysis.

*   **Comparison/Contrast:** The essay successfully highlights both the similarities and differences in Walcott's and Coetzee's approaches.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Clarity and Precision:** Some sentences and paragraphs are dense and could benefit from clearer phrasing. The logic connecting ideas is not always explicitly articulated.
*   **Argumentative Depth:** While the essay identifies interesting points, it sometimes lacks sufficient depth of analysis. The connections between the textual evidence and the broader argument could be strengthened.
*   **Organization:** While generally logical, the essay's structure could be further refined. A more explicit outline of the argument in the introduction would help guide the reader.
*   **Over-Reliance on Quotes/Paraphrase:** While quotes are used appropriately, there are times where the analysis feels more like summarizing the texts or repeating others' arguments than developing a unique and insightful interpretation.
*   **Proofreading:** There are a few typos and grammatical errors that should be corrected.

**Specific Suggestions**

1.  **Introduction and Thesis:**

    *   *Clarity:* While the opening is engaging, make the connection between the opening quote and the main argument more explicit.
    *   *Explicit Thesis:* Consider rephrasing the thesis statement to be even more direct about the specific argument you will be making. For example: "By examining Walcott's *Omeros* and Coetzee's *Waiting for the Barbarians*, this essay argues that both authors use the interplay of history and memory to challenge dominant narratives and give voice to marginalized perspectives, but their approaches differ significantly in their representation of collective and individual memory."
2.  **Body Paragraphs:**

    *   *Topic Sentences:* Ensure each paragraph begins with a clear topic sentence that directly relates to the thesis and previews the main point of the paragraph.
    *   *Transitions:* Improve the transitions between paragraphs. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas smoothly and highlight the relationships between different points.
    *   *Elaborate on Connections:* When you introduce a quote or concept, don't just state it. Explain *why* it's relevant to your argument and *how* it supports your overall thesis.
    *   *Go Deeper with Analysis:* Instead of just summarizing the plot or the characters' actions, analyze the *implications* of these actions. What do they reveal about the themes of history, memory, and power?
    *   *Avoid Over-Reliance on Secondary Sources:* Use secondary sources to support your own arguments, not to replace them. Make sure your voice is prominent in the analysis.
    *  *Deeper Dive into Theory*: Consider elaborating on *how* Benjamin or Said's theories are applicable.  How does Walcott *specifically* subvert Orientalism?

3.  **Coetzee Section:**

    *   *Allegory:* The idea of Coetzee as allegory is good. Consider explicitly addressing the potential limitations of allegory.

4.  **Walcott Section:**

    *   *Plunkett:* Good point regarding the Plunkett character!
    *   *Helen:* Good point of tying the character to Said.

5.  **Conclusion:**

    *   *Synthesize:* The conclusion should effectively synthesize the main points of the essay and reiterate the thesis in a new and insightful way.
    *   *Broader Implications:* Consider discussing the broader implications of your analysis. Why is it important to understand the relationship between history and memory in postcolonial literature? What can we learn from these texts about the construction of identity and the challenges of decolonization?

6.  **Style and Tone:**

    *   *Clarity:* Aim for concise and direct language. Avoid jargon or overly complex sentence structures.
    *   *Proofread Carefully:* Pay attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

**Example of Improvement (Paragraph):**

**Original:**

"On the other hand, J.M.Coetzee's *Waiting for the Barbarians* employs a single voice to tell the allegorical history of an abstract frontier. "By setting his novel in an unnamed country at an unnamed time, by terming the two parties the Empire and the Barbarians...Coetzee creates an allegorical landscape that loosely suggests the Roman Empire on the verge of collapse but undoubtedly points to South Africa today‚Äù (Gallagher 281). Unlike Walcott, Coetzee indexes a theoretical geography and gives it a single voice."

**Revised:**

"In contrast to Walcott's polyphonic approach, J.M. Coetzee's *Waiting for the Barbarians* utilizes a single, introspective voice to explore the themes of empire and barbarism. By setting the novel in an "unnamed country at an unnamed time" and using allegorical terms like "the Empire" and "the Barbarians," Coetzee creates a landscape that transcends specific historical contexts, though it inevitably evokes parallels to the Roman Empire and, more pointedly, apartheid-era South Africa (Gallagher 281). This deliberate abstraction, in contrast to Walcott's focus on a specific location, allows Coetzee to..." [Continue with your analysis, explaining *why* this difference in narrative approach is significant].

**In summary, this is a well-researched and thoughtful essay. By focusing on clarity, depth of analysis, and strengthening the connections between your evidence and your argument, you can elevate this essay to the next level.**
