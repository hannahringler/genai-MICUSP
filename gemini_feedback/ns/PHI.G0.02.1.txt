Okay, here's some feedback on the paper "Aristotle on Friendship," focusing on its strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

This is a well-written and thoughtful analysis of Aristotle's theory of friendship. You clearly demonstrate a good understanding of the *Nicomachean Ethics* and the *Rhetoric* and engage critically with both Aristotle's own arguments and interpretations of them. The structure is logical, and the writing is generally clear and concise. The paper presents a balanced approach, acknowledging both the strengths and weaknesses of Aristotle's account.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Understanding of Aristotle:** You show a strong grasp of Aristotle's key concepts, including the different types of friendship (CB, AB, PB), the importance of virtue, and the role of friendship in the good life.
*   **Well-Structured Argument:** The paper follows a logical progression, starting with Aristotle's definition of friendship, moving to a discussion of the different types, and then examining his arguments for the necessity of friendship in a good life.
*   **Critical Engagement:** You don't simply summarize Aristotle's views; you critically evaluate them, pointing out potential problems and inconsistencies.  Your engagement with John Cooper's interpretation is particularly strong.
*   **Specific Examples:** You use concrete examples to illustrate Aristotle's points and your own critiques, making the abstract concepts more accessible (e.g., the bowling/blackjack example).
*   **Good Use of Quotes:** You incorporate relevant quotes from Aristotle's texts to support your claims, and you provide accurate citations.
*   **Balanced Perspective:** You acknowledge the limitations of Aristotle's framework but also recognize its value as a starting point for further discussion.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Addressing Potential Counterarguments:** While you do address some potential objections to Aristotle's view, you could strengthen the paper by more explicitly considering and responding to alternative interpretations of his claims. For example, you could explore arguments against the idea that CB friendships are the best, or consider the possibility that AB friendships can be meaningful even after their initial utility has faded.
*   **Refining the Thesis:** Your introduction mentions explaining Aristotle's theory of friendship and showing where he leaves gaps that need to be filled. While the paper achieves this, the thesis could be made more specific. Consider stating the main conclusion you draw from analyzing those gaps and elaborating on why it matters for a modern audience.
*   **Further Elaboration on Gaps and Modern Relevance:** You identify some gaps in Aristotle's account (e.g., the question of adolescent friendships, the dissolution of AB friendships). You could expand on the significance of these gaps. How might a modern understanding of human relationships help to fill these gaps? Why is it important for us to address these shortcomings in Aristotle's theory?
*   **Specificity on the relationship between friendship and virtue:** Aristotle discusses that CB friendships are the ideal when both people are virtuous. But what does it mean for the concept of the good life when that is not the case? Could the same be said for virtues such as justice?

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **On the Problem of Adolescent Friendships:** When discussing the problem of whether adolescents can have CB friendships, you could explore the idea that adolescents might value different virtues than adults, or that their understanding of virtue might be more limited.
*   **On the Dissolution of AB Friendships:** You raise a good point about the problem of AB friendships dissolving when their utility is gone. You could explore this further by considering the possibility that these friendships might evolve into something more than just a means to an end, even if they were initially based on utility.
*   **On the "Natural Limit" to Friendship:** You mention Aristotle's claim that there is a natural limit to the number of friends one can have. This is an interesting point that could be developed further. What factors might contribute to this limit? Is it primarily a matter of time and energy, or are there other psychological or social constraints?  Consider if this claim still holds in a modern world with social media.
*   **Clarify the Definition of "Good Life":** The paper assumes a particular understanding of Aristotle's conception of the "good life."  Explicitly stating this understanding (e.g., as eudaimonia, or flourishing) would help the reader better understand your critique.
*   **Clarify Use of "Essential" vs. "Desirable":** You distinguish between arguments that friendships are "essential" and those that they are merely "desirable." It would be helpful to define more precisely what you mean by these terms in the context of Aristotle's theory. Does "essential" mean *necessary* for happiness, or *constitutive* of it?
*   **Proofreading:** Carefully proofread the paper for any minor errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation.

**Example Edits**

*   **Original:** "But this seems somewhat problematic: can't adolescents (still prone to their passions) have mutual admiration of virtues in one another?"
    *   **Revised:** "However, this raises a challenge.  While adolescents may be prone to passions that hinder virtuous action, is it impossible for them to genuinely admire virtuous qualities in others, even if their understanding of those qualities is still developing?"
*   **Original:** "You could explore this further by considering the possibility that these friendships might evolve into something more than just a means to an end, even if they were initially based on utility."
*   **Revised:** "These friendships might evolve into something more than just a means to an end by developing mutual interest in things that are not just utility related."

**In conclusion,** this is a strong paper that demonstrates a good understanding of Aristotle's theory of friendship. By addressing the areas for improvement and making the suggested revisions, you can further strengthen your analysis and produce an even more compelling and insightful essay. Good job!
