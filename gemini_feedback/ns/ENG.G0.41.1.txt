Okay, here's some feedback on the essay, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and overall effectiveness:

**Overall Impression:**

The essay demonstrates a solid understanding of Aristotle's Poetics and applies it to an analysis of Sarah Kane's *Blasted*. The central argument – that *Blasted* is an "anti-Aristotelian" tragedy – is clearly stated and consistently pursued. The writing is generally strong, with evidence of critical thinking. However, there are areas where the analysis could be deepened, and the structure could be refined for greater impact.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The opening paragraph clearly establishes the essay's main argument.
*   **Good Understanding of Aristotle:** The essay demonstrates a good grasp of Aristotelian concepts such as plot, causality, and mimesis.
*   **Relevant Examples:** The essay uses specific examples from both *Oedipus Rex* and *Blasted* to support its claims.
*   **Strong Vocabulary and Writing Style:** The writing is generally clear, precise, and academic in tone.
*   **Consistent Argument:** The essay maintains its focus on the central argument throughout.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Deeper Analysis of *Blasted*:**
    *   **Elaborate on Kane's choices:** While the essay identifies *Blasted's* anti-Aristotelian elements, it could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of *why* Kane might have chosen to deviate from classical tragic conventions. What is Kane trying to achieve by presenting a reality that is "random, chaotic, amoral, and imbalanced?" Does this reflect a particular worldview or a critique of society?
    *   **Explore thematic implications:** Connect the formal elements (plot, character) to the broader themes of *Blasted*, such as violence, trauma, and the breakdown of social order. How do the play's anti-Aristotelian features contribute to its thematic concerns?
    *   **Consider counterarguments:** Are there any interpretations of *Blasted* that might align it *more* closely with Aristotelian ideas? Acknowledging and addressing potential counterarguments would strengthen the essay's overall persuasiveness.

2.  **Nuance in the Comparison:**
    *   **Avoid oversimplification:** While the "anti-Aristotelian" framework is useful, be cautious about presenting Aristotle and Kane as complete opposites. Are there *any* points of connection or resonance between their approaches to tragedy?
    *   **Acknowledge Historical Context:** Aristotle's Poetics was written in a very different historical and cultural context than Kane's *Blasted*. Briefly acknowledging these differences could add depth to the analysis.

3.  **Refine Structure and Flow:**
    *   **Strengthen Transitions:** Improve the transitions between paragraphs to create a smoother and more coherent flow of ideas. Use transition words and phrases to signal the relationship between different points.
    *   **Consider a stronger conclusion:** The conclusion restates the thesis but could be more impactful. Consider ending with a more thought-provoking statement about the significance of Kane's anti-Aristotelian approach or its implications for contemporary drama.

4.  **Specific Suggestions:**
    *   **"The difference is found in the methods by which playwright's like Kane implement..."** Consider revising to "playwrights like Kane implement..."
    *   **"characters give the mere illusion of volition..."** This is a strong statement that needs further unpacking. How does Kane create this illusion? What specific techniques does she employ?
    *   **"the events in *Blasted*, rather than externally imposing themselves onto characters, arise from the actions of the characters."** This is a key point but could be phrased more concisely and powerfully. Consider: "In contrast to classical tragedy, the events in *Blasted* are driven by character actions rather than external forces."

**Revised paragraph example to show how to be more specific**

**Original:**

> The play's plot, in addition to arising from characters rather than imposing itself on them, is discordant with classical standards of tragic causality. Aristotle asserts in Poetics:

**Revised:**

> The play's plot, in addition to arising from characters and their volitions, is discordant with classical standards of tragic causality. Aristotle asserts in Poetics that effective tragedies should follow a clear, predictable path in order to create catharsis. However, Kane creates a plot that seems arbitrary. This is seen when the soldier enters.

**In summary:**

This is a well-written and insightful essay with a clear argument. By deepening the analysis of *Blasted*, adding nuance to the comparison with Aristotle, and refining the structure, you can elevate it to an even higher level. Good work!
