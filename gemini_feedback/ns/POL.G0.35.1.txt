Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can offer some feedback. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper tackles an important and complex issue: the subtle and persistent forms of racism in America. The author clearly has strong feelings about the topic and a desire to promote equality. The argument is generally understandable, but it could be strengthened with more specific evidence and a more nuanced approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Important Topic:** The paper addresses a relevant and significant issue that deserves attention.
*   **Clear Thesis (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated in one sentence, the paper argues that racism continues to exist in America in subtle, often institutionalized ways, despite legal progress.
*   **Use of Evidence:** The paper cites some statistics and studies to support its claims (e.g., unemployment rates, housing discrimination studies, drug sentencing disparities).
*   **Personal Connection:** The author includes a personal reflection, which adds a layer of authenticity to the paper.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of a Clear, Concise Thesis Statement:** The paper lacks a well-defined thesis statement in the introduction. A strong thesis statement would clearly articulate the main argument of the paper and provide a roadmap for the reader.
*   **Generalizations and Overstatements:** The paper contains generalizations that need to be qualified or supported with more evidence. For example, statements like "ignorance prevails among many white Americans" are too broad.
*   **Limited Evidence and Analysis:** While the paper cites some sources, it could benefit from more in-depth analysis of the evidence and a wider range of sources. The citations are also formatted inconsistently.
*   **Organization and Flow:** The paper's organization could be improved. The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, and the overall flow of the argument could be smoother.
*   **Tone:** The tone is somewhat accusatory and could be more balanced. While it's important to address the issue of racism directly, it's also important to avoid alienating readers.
*   **Grammar and Style:** There are some minor grammatical and stylistic issues that need to be addressed.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Develop a Clear Thesis Statement:**
    *   In the introduction, clearly state the main argument of the paper. For example: "Despite legal advancements, subtle forms of racism persist in American institutions and societal attitudes, perpetuating inequalities in areas such as employment, housing, and criminal justice."

2.  **Provide More Specific Evidence:**
    *   Instead of making general statements, provide concrete examples and data to support your claims.
    *   For example, when discussing income inequality, cite specific statistics on the income gap between white and black Americans.
    *   When discussing housing discrimination, provide details about the types of discrimination that still occur.
    *   When discussing drug sentencing disparities, cite additional sources and provide more context about the historical and social factors that contribute to these disparities.

3.  **Analyze the Evidence:**
    *   Don't just present the evidence; explain its significance and how it supports your argument.
    *   For example, when discussing the study on resume names, explain how the results demonstrate the existence of implicit bias in hiring practices.

4.  **Broaden the Scope of Research:**
    *   Consult a wider range of sources, including scholarly articles, books, and reports from reputable organizations.
    *   Consider incorporating diverse perspectives on the issue of racism.

5.  **Refine the Organization and Flow:**
    *   Create a clear outline of the paper to ensure that it flows logically.
    *   Use transitions to connect paragraphs and ideas.
    *   Consider breaking up long paragraphs into shorter ones.

6.  **Adjust the Tone:**
    *   While it's important to be direct and honest, avoid making generalizations or accusatory statements that could alienate readers.
    *   Focus on presenting the facts and evidence in a clear and objective manner.

7.  **Address Counterarguments:**
    *   Acknowledge and address counterarguments to your thesis. This will make your argument more persuasive and demonstrate that you have considered different perspectives. For example, you could discuss the argument that affirmative action has been ineffective or that racism is no longer a significant problem in America.

8.  **Proofread Carefully:**
    *   Proofread the paper carefully for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and typos.
    *   Pay attention to sentence structure and clarity.

**Revised Structure Suggestion:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Start with a hook to grab the reader's attention.
    *   Provide some background information on the history of racism in America.
    *   State your thesis statement.
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   *Paragraph 1:* Discuss the subtle forms of racism that exist in the labor market.
        *   Provide evidence from studies on resume names and unemployment rates.
        *   Analyze the significance of the evidence.
    *   *Paragraph 2:* Discuss the subtle forms of racism that exist in the housing market.
        *   Provide evidence from housing discrimination studies.
        *   Analyze the significance of the evidence.
    *   *Paragraph 3:* Discuss the subtle forms of racism that exist in the criminal justice system.
        *   Provide evidence on drug sentencing disparities and incarceration rates.
        *   Analyze the significance of the evidence.
    *   *Paragraph 4:* Address counterarguments to your thesis.
        *   Acknowledge and respond to different perspectives on the issue of racism.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the main points of your argument.
    *   Reiterate your thesis statement in a new way.
    *   Offer some suggestions for how to address the issue of racism.
    *   End with a call to action or a final thought-provoking statement.

By addressing these weaknesses and incorporating these suggestions, you can strengthen the argument and make the paper more persuasive and impactful. Good luck!
