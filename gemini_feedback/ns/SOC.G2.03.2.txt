Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can provide some feedback. Here's a breakdown of strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement, focusing on both content and structure:

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the core concepts of Hobbes, Malthus, and Marx. It attempts a sophisticated analysis of their similarities and differences, linking their theories to their historical contexts. However, there are areas where the argumentation can be strengthened, and the analysis deepened. The essay would benefit from more specific examples, a more clearly articulated thesis, and more critical engagement with the material.
*   **Clarity of Argument:** Sometimes, the central argument gets a bit lost in the details. A more focused and clearly articulated thesis statement in the introduction would significantly improve the paper's coherence.

**Strengths:**

*   **Understanding of Core Concepts:** You demonstrate a grasp of Hobbes' state of nature, Malthus' population theory, and Marx's concepts of alienation and false consciousness.
*   **Comparison and Contrast:** The essay attempts to compare and contrast the thinkers, which is a good analytical approach.
*   **Contextualization:** You acknowledge the importance of historical context in shaping the thinkers' ideas, particularly in relation to Hobbes and Malthus.
*   **Structure (Generally):** The paper follows a logical structure, with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.
*   **Use of Sources:** You cite sources correctly and integrate them into your analysis (though could improve as discussed below)

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Thesis Statement:** The introduction lacks a strong, clear thesis statement that explicitly outlines the paper's argument. The reader should know *exactly* what the paper is trying to prove and what the structure will be.
*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper covers the key ideas, the analysis sometimes feels superficial. The comparisons and contrasts between the thinkers could be more nuanced. For example, you could delve deeper into the philosophical underpinnings of their assumptions about human nature.
*   **Specific Examples:** The paper would benefit from more concrete examples from the thinkers' works to support your claims. Instead of just stating that Hobbes believed people were self-interested, cite a specific passage from *Leviathan* that illustrates this point.
*   **Critical Engagement:** The paper primarily summarizes the thinkers' ideas rather than critically engaging with them. Consider raising potential counterarguments or exploring limitations of their theories. Are there alternative interpretations? What are the criticisms leveled against these thinkers?
*   **Marx Section Depth and Thesis Connect:** The second half on Marx feels somewhat separate from the first half's comparison. It needs to be more explicitly linked back to the initial question, or the question should adjust.
*   **"Anti-Positivism" Concept:** The paper briefly mentions "anti-positivism," but this concept is not fully explained or convincingly applied to Marx's work. Clarify what you mean by anti-positivism and how it manifests in Marx's critique of political and economic liberalism.
*   **Over-reliance on Lecture Notes:** While lecture notes can be helpful, relying too heavily on them can limit the originality and depth of your analysis. Prioritize the core literature of the scholars.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Strengthen the Thesis Statement:** In the introduction, explicitly state the main argument of the paper. For example: "While Hobbes and Malthus share similar assumptions about human nature, their contrasting historical contexts led them to divergent conclusions about the role of the state, a divergence rooted in [some specific aspect - your argument]." For the second half about Marx, relate the ideas to political and economic liberalism explicitly.

2.  **Deepen the Analysis:**
    *   **Human Nature:** Explore the underlying philosophical assumptions about human nature that drive Hobbes, Malthus, and Marx's theories. How do their views differ from other contemporary thinkers?
    *   **Role of the State:** Analyze the specific mechanisms by which Hobbes and Malthus envision the state operating. What are the potential problems or benefits of their respective models?
    *   **Connect the thinkers**: You've noted that Hobbes and Malthus were both liberal/utilitarian. Deepen the analysis of the similarities and differences in their assumptions, rather than just saying they are both self-interested.
    *   **Marx Critiques**: Explore the specifics of each critique that Marx makes to liberalism in each work. For instance, when you say, "*In On the Jewish Question, Marx strongly critiques the ideas of political and economic liberalism.*" you need to explain why.

3.  **Provide More Specific Examples:**
    *   Support your claims with direct quotations or specific examples from *Leviathan*, *An Essay on the Principle of Population*, and Marx's works.
    *   Example: Instead of saying "Hobbes believes people are inherently self-interested," write: "Hobbes argues that in the state of nature, individuals are driven by a 'perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death' (Leviathan, Ch. 11)."

4.  **Engage in Critical Evaluation:**
    *   Acknowledge potential criticisms of Hobbes, Malthus, and Marx.
    *   Consider the limitations of their theories or alternative perspectives.
    *   For example: "While Hobbes' Leviathan offers a compelling solution to the problem of social order, critics argue that it justifies authoritarianism and fails to protect individual liberties."
    *   The essay mentions the perversity thesis. Perhaps further explore it.

5.  **Clarify the "Anti-Positivism" Concept:**
    *   Define what you mean by "anti-positivism."
    *   Explain how it manifests in Marx's methodology.
    *   Provide specific examples of how Marx looks "beneath the surface" of capitalist relations.
    *   For example: "Marx's anti-positivist approach rejects the idea that capitalist relations are natural or inevitable. Instead, he seeks to uncover the underlying power dynamics and exploitation that are hidden by the surface appearance of free markets."

6.  **Strengthen Connections:**
    * Make sure to keep tying your points back to the prompt for each section. Especially with Marx, explain how it links to political and economic liberalism.

**Revised structure (Example):**

*   **Introduction:** Clear thesis statement outlining the comparison between Hobbes, Malthus, and Marx and their historical contexts.
*   **Hobbes and Malthus**:
    *   Assumptions about human nature.
    *   Role of the state: contrasting visions, strengths, and weaknesses.
    *   Influence of historical context: English Civil War and 18th-century England.
*   **Marx**:
    *   Marx's critique of political and economic liberalism (connect this *explicitly* to Hobbes and Malthus' view of it).
    *   Examples from *On the Jewish Question*, *1844 Manuscripts*, *Communist Manifesto*, and *Capital*.
    *   Application of "anti-positivism" to Marx's critique.
*   **Conclusion:** Summarize the main points and offer a final reflection on the thinkers' enduring relevance.

By addressing these weaknesses and incorporating these suggestions, you can elevate your paper to a higher level of analysis and argumentation. Good luck!
