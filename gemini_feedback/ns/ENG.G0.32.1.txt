Okay, here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of this essay, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The essay presents a clear argument that Daniel Defoe's *Robinson Crusoe* supports the idea of European dominance and colonialism through Crusoe's attitudes and actions toward slavery. The essay utilizes textual evidence and critical sources to support this claim. The writing is generally competent, although it can be improved with tighter prose and a more nuanced approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis statement is clearly articulated in the introductory paragraph, and the essay stays focused on supporting that thesis.
*   **Strong Textual Evidence:** The essay uses numerous direct quotes from *Robinson Crusoe* to illustrate Crusoe's views on slavery and his relationships with enslaved individuals.
*   **Use of Secondary Sources:** The essay incorporates relevant critical interpretations from Ian Watt and James Joyce to support its argument.
*   **Organization:** The essay is logically organized, with each paragraph building upon the previous one to develop the overall argument.
*   **Engaging Topic:** The chosen topic allows for a discussion of complex themes in the book, which helps create an interesting essay.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Nuance & Complexity:** The argument sometimes presents Crusoe and Defoe as monolithically pro-slavery, which simplifies the complexities of the novel and the historical context. There is an acknowledgement that "Crusoe treats his servant with respect", but more can be done to unpack this and show a more nuanced position.
*   **Over-Reliance on Direct Quotes:** While textual evidence is important, the essay sometimes relies too heavily on direct quotes without sufficient analysis and explanation.
*   **Some Rhetorical Devices are Oversimplified**: By writing "By branding Friday as a 'savage' that he attempts to control, it's easier for Crusoe to turn him into his servant; he forces Friday to be his slave while justifying it by teaching him the ways of the Bible and Christian ethics", the argument becomes a bit of a slippery slope, and assumes more of the author's intent than is evidenced by the writing.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Develop a More Nuanced Argument:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments. For example, you could explore the ways in which Crusoe's initial experiences as a slave shape his later actions, or discuss the potential for Defoe to be critiquing colonial attitudes through his portrayal of Crusoe. Does the text ever show any doubts on the part of Crusoe towards his actions, or any instances where Friday appears to act of his own accord?
*   **Elaborate on Analysis:** Spend more time analyzing the direct quotes you provide. Explain *why* these quotes are significant and how they support your argument. Don't simply present the quote and assume the reader will understand its relevance.
*   **Tighten Prose:**
    *   Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases. For example, phrases like "In order to gain a full perspective on..." can often be shortened to "To understand..."
    *   Vary sentence structure to improve readability.
    *   Pay attention to grammar and mechanics to ensure clarity.
*   **Consider Counterarguments:** Are there alternative interpretations of Crusoe's actions or the novel's themes? Addressing these counterarguments will strengthen your own argument.
*   **Expand the Conclusion:** The conclusion could be more robust. Instead of simply restating the thesis, try to offer a final insight or broader implication of your argument.

**Specific Examples to Consider:**

*   **Xury's Case:** When discussing the sale of Xury, acknowledge that Crusoe also frames this as potentially beneficial to Xury ("set him free in ten Years, if he turn’d Christian"). Does this change the meaning of what Crusoe is doing? Can this be spun a different way?
*   **Friday's "Affection":** You write, "Friday undoubtedly is gracious for Crusoe's saving of his life, but his “affection” for Crusoe isn't “like those of a Child to a Father” at all...". This is a good point, but you could develop it further. What *is* the nature of their relationship? How does Friday's loyalty and affection manifest?

**Revised Example Paragraph (incorporating suggestions):**

**Original:**

>   Crusoe describes his island as solely his: “My island was now peopled, and I thought my self very rich in Subjects; and it was a merry Reflection which I frequently made, How like a King I look'd...My people were perfectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and Lawgiver...” (174). Here, Crusoe finally merges his notions of his own control over the island and his power over the people on his island, or rather, his subjects. He is “Lord,” and no one can strip him of the title, at

**Revised:**

>   Crusoe's self-proclaimed "Lordship" over the island reveals his deeply ingrained desire for absolute authority: "My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in Subjects; and it was a merry Reflection which I frequently made, How like a King I look'd...My people were perfectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and Lawgiver..." (174). The very language Crusoe employs – "Subjects," "Lord," "Lawgiver" – evokes the structures of European monarchy and colonial power. This passage suggests that Crusoe not only desires to control the island's resources, but also to impose a hierarchical social order upon its inhabitants, mirroring the dynamics of European colonialism where colonizers sought to subjugate and govern indigenous populations.

**In Summary:**

This is a good start to a critical essay. By adding nuance, developing your analysis, and tightening your prose, you can elevate it to a higher level. Good luck!
