Okay, I've reviewed the paper and here's some feedback, broken down into categories:

**Overall Impressions:**

*   **Competent but Basic:** The paper demonstrates a basic understanding of soil mechanics principles and their application to dam design. However, it lacks depth in several areas and relies heavily on formulas without fully explaining the underlying concepts or justifying choices.
*   **Report Format, not a Research Paper:** It reads more like a consulting report than a research paper. While this isn't necessarily bad, it impacts the style and expected level of analysis.
*   **Language:** The writing is generally clear, but some sections could benefit from more precise and sophisticated language. Also, there are some slightly awkward phrasings.
*   **Lack of Visualizations in Appendices:** You have referenced many appendices but the appendices themselves were missing. That limits the ability to judge how well the visuals support the arguments.

**Specific Feedback:**

**1. Clarity and Organization:**

*   **Abstract/Executive Summary (Missing):** A research paper should have an abstract or executive summary at the beginning that briefly outlines the purpose, methods, key findings, and conclusions. This is crucial.
*   **Introduction Could be Stronger:**
    *   Give a greater context about the dam and the need for soil analysis.
    *   Explicitly state the research question or problem being addressed. What specific uncertainties are you trying to resolve?
    *   Clearly outline the scope of the paper.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Expand on the methodology. Explain *why* you chose these specific ASTM standards and tests. What are the advantages and limitations of each test?
    *   Be more specific about the soil sampling process. How many samples were taken? Where were they taken from?
    *   "These guidelines were generally followed..." - This is vague and concerning. Any deviations from standard procedures should be explicitly stated and justified, along with their potential impact on the results.
*   **Results and Analysis:**
    *   **Deeper Interpretation:** The analysis section is largely descriptive (e.g., "Soil restraint criteria were met..."). It needs to go further. *Why* are these criteria important? What are the implications of meeting or not meeting them?
    *   **Justification of Design Choice:** You conclude that design 2 is preferable. Provide a more compelling argument for this choice, going beyond simply stating that it has lower seepage. Consider factors like cost, constructability, long-term performance, and potential risks.
*   **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
    *   Be more specific in recommendations. For example, if you suggest a seepage blanket, provide more details on its design (e.g., material, thickness, extent).
    *   Address the limitations of the study. What factors could affect the accuracy of your results? What further research is needed?
*   **Appendices:** It's impossible to evaluate if the information in the appendices is displayed properly without access to the appendices.

**2. Technical Depth and Accuracy:**

*   **Explanation of Soil Mechanics Principles:** The paper assumes a certain level of knowledge from the reader. Briefly explain key concepts like permeability, soil restraint, and the significance of D10, D30, and D60.
*   **Hazen Equation Discussion:** You correctly point out the limitations of the Hazen equation. Explain *why* it's unreliable for these soils. What are the underlying assumptions of the Hazen equation, and how do they not apply in this case?
*   **Seepage Analysis:** The explanation of the seepage analysis is too brief. Provide more details on how the flownets were used and the assumptions made in the calculations.
*   **Units:** Be meticulous about units throughout the paper. Ensure consistency and proper conversion.
*   **Figures and Tables:** Number all figures and tables, and refer to them by number in the text. Use descriptive captions to explain their content.
*   **Citation:** Properly cite all sources.

**3. Writing Style and Grammar:**

*   **Formal Tone:** Maintain a formal and objective tone throughout the paper. Avoid colloquialisms and overly casual language.
*   **Precise Language:** Use precise language to avoid ambiguity. For example, instead of "the stability and resistance to washout is crucial," consider something like "the stability of the dam structure and its resistance to erosion are critical for its long-term performance."
*   **Sentence Structure:** Vary sentence structure to improve readability.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper carefully for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and typos.

**Specific Examples:**

*   **Page 2:** "Each dam has a slightly different configuration but will ultimately be supported by these soils..." - This sentence is awkward. Rephrase for clarity.
*   **Page 3:** "Since this could affect the results much care was taken to ensure this was accomplished." - This is vague. What specific steps did you take to ensure the relative density matched the in-situ density?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Add an Abstract:** Summarize the paper's key points.
2.  **Strengthen the Introduction:** Provide more context and clearly state the research question.
3.  **Expand the Methodology:** Justify the choice of tests and provide more details on the experimental procedures.
4.  **Deepen the Analysis:** Interpret the results in the context of dam design and soil mechanics principles.
5.  **Provide a Stronger Justification:** Support the conclusion that Design 2 is superior with a more comprehensive argument.
6.  **Refine the Writing:** Use precise language and improve sentence structure.
7.  **Proofread Carefully:** Eliminate errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
8.  **Include the Appendices:** So that the data, calculations, and illustrations can be properly reviewed.

By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the clarity, technical depth, and overall quality of your paper. Good luck!
