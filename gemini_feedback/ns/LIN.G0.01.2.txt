Okay, I've reviewed the lesson plan. Here's some feedback, focusing on clarity, practicality, and effectiveness for ESL students:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Goals and Objectives:**  You've clearly stated what you intend for students to learn. The goals are content-based (geography) and language-based (directions, state locations). The objectives are measurable (identifying states on a map, making statements about location).
*   **Logical Progression:** The lesson follows a logical sequence, moving from introducing vocabulary and concepts to practicing them in different contexts (group work, pairs, individual).
*   **Variety of Activities:**  You've incorporated a good mix of activities to engage different learning styles: whole-class instruction, pair work, group work, games.
*   **Materials Included:** Providing handouts with maps, directions, and exercises is helpful.
*   **Consideration for Beginner ESL:** You acknowledge the varying English levels and plan to address pronunciation and use visual aids.

**Areas for Improvement and Suggestions:**

*   **Specificity for ESL:** While you state the target audience is beginner ESL, the activities could be *more specifically tailored* to their needs.
    *   **Scaffolding Language:**  Provide sentence frames for the activities. For example, instead of just saying "Our state is north of Texas," give students sentence stems like:
        *   "My state is _______ (direction) of ________ (state)."
        *   "Is your state ________ (state)?" "Yes, it is." / "No, it isn't."
    *   **Visuals:** Even more visual aids would be beneficial. Pictures of landmarks or products associated with different states could make it more engaging.
    *   **Vocabulary Pre-Teaching:**  Identify key vocabulary (besides just directions and state names) that students might struggle with (e.g., "southeast," "borders," "located"). Pre-teach these words *before* the activities.

*   **Clarity and Practicality of Activities:**

    *   **"Guess the State" Game:**  The rules of the game are a bit vague.  Consider a simpler version or provide a clear example.  For example:
        *   **Teacher:** "My state is on the West Coast. It's famous for Hollywood. What's my state?"
        *   **Student:** "Is it California?"
        *   **Teacher:** "Yes, it is!"
    *   **Differentiation:**  How will you support students who are struggling? How will you challenge students who are grasping the material quickly?  Prepare some extension activities (e.g., having students research a specific state).
    *   **Timing:**  Be realistic about how long each activity will take. Five minutes to complete Appendix C might be too short, especially for beginner ESL learners.  Have backup activities in case you finish early.

*   **Feedback and Error Correction:** The lesson plan doesn't explicitly mention how you will provide feedback or correct errors. Consider incorporating this.  You could:
    *   Correct errors during the group activities.
    *   Provide whole-class feedback after the exercises.
    *   Collect the handouts and provide written feedback.

*   **Appendix B (Directions):**
    *  This is a good exercise, but ensure the students understand the difference of "the North", "the East", "North of", and "South of" and so on.

*   **Appendix C Exercise:**
    *   It might be beneficial to give the students the states' names on the exercise with a map of the states next to the question to help them.

**Specific Edits/Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Consider adding a brief "hook" to grab students' attention at the beginning.  For example, you could start with a picture of a famous place in the US and ask them if they know where it is.
*   **Objectives:** Consider adding "I can point to the specific state on the map."

**Revised Goal Example:**
*   "The goal then of this lesson is to impart some knowledge of the subject of geography to students of ESL. Students should learn and be able to use basic vocabulary involving directions and should be familiarized with the location of the different states in the US. The students will also be able to talk and describe the states' locations by using terms of directions. I am planning for a class with around twenty to thirty students with several different first languages and varying degrees of beginner English skills."

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-structured and thoughtful lesson plan. With some minor adjustments to better address the specific needs of beginner ESL learners, it has the potential to be very effective.
