Okay, I can provide feedback on this essay. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The essay presents a clear argument: that etiquette, while important, is not a reliable indicator of a person's true character in *Pride and Prejudice* and *Evelina*. It draws on specific examples from both novels to support this claim. The essay is well-organized and generally well-written.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The central argument is stated explicitly in the introduction and revisited throughout the essay.
*   **Strong Evidence:** The essay effectively uses textual evidence from both novels (quotes and specific scenes) to support its claims. The examples are well-chosen and relevant.
*   **Good Analysis:** The essay goes beyond simply summarizing the plot and engages in some analysis of the characters' motivations and the significance of their actions.
*   **Organization:** The essay follows a logical structure, moving from a general definition of etiquette to specific examples from each novel and then to a concluding summary.
*   **Clear Writing:** The writing is generally clear and easy to understand. The vocabulary is appropriate for an undergraduate essay.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the essay provides a good overview, some points could be explored in more depth. The essay seems to be lacking in some of the connections between the claims, and the overall analysis of why these books are showing the readers these situations.
*   **Nuance:** The essay could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of etiquette. It tends to present etiquette as a purely negative force. It's important to consider the potential benefits of etiquette (creating social order, facilitating communication) while still arguing that it shouldn't be the *sole* measure of character.
*   **Sophistication of Argument:** The argument is somewhat straightforward. To elevate the essay, consider exploring more complex ideas related to etiquette, social class, and individual expression.
*   **Concluding too early.** The conclusion should expand on the importance of the claim and show why readers should care.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

**Introduction:**

*   **Hook/Context:** Instead of going straight to the definition of Etiquette, start with a hook that grabs the reader's attention. Perhaps a brief anecdote about how etiquette has changed over time, or a question about the role of manners in modern society.
*   **Thesis Clarity:** Ensure the thesis statement explicitly connects the ideas of etiquette, social class, and the novels' critiques of superficial judgment.

**Body Paragraphs:**

*   **Evelina Examples:** The Willoughby example is well analyzed. Consider how Evelina's lack of proper etiquette could also stem from her lack of proper upbringing and education. This can add another layer to the analysis, discussing the societal pressures for young ladies.
*   **Pride and Prejudice Examples:** You could push further on the analysis of Elizabeth. Why is her willingness to break social norms so valuable, according to the novel? What does it say about Austen's values? Why is Collin's character made so ridiculous? Discuss how Elizabeth and Collin's characters act as foils.
*   **Expand on the "Why":** Instead of just stating that etiquette fails as a measure of character, explain *why* it fails. Does it prioritize appearances over substance? Does it reinforce social hierarchies? Is it too rigid to accommodate individual differences?
*   **Consider Counterarguments:** Briefly acknowledge the potential benefits of etiquette or the opposing view. This will strengthen your argument by demonstrating that you've considered multiple perspectives. For instance, is there value in using Etiquette as an initial screening process, even if a deeper understanding is required to truly know a person?
*   **Transitions:** While the organization is good, work on smoother transitions between paragraphs.

**Conclusion:**

*   **Beyond Summary:** Avoid simply restating the thesis. Instead, consider the broader implications of your argument.
*   **Tie Back to Introduction:** Connect back to the opening hook or question, providing a sense of closure.
*   **So What?** Answer the "so what?" question. Why does this matter? What can we learn from these novels about the importance of looking beyond superficial appearances and valuing true character?

**Other Minor Points:**

*   **Proofread Carefully:** Do a final proofread to catch any minor errors in grammar or spelling.

**Example of How to Deepen the Analysis (Elizabeth Bennet):**

Instead of simply stating that Elizabeth breaks social norms, you could analyze *why* this is presented as a positive trait. Is it because:

*   It demonstrates her independence and intelligence?
*   It allows her to see through the superficiality of high society?
*   It challenges rigid social hierarchies and promotes equality?
*   It ultimately leads to a more authentic and fulfilling relationship with Darcy?

By exploring these questions, you can move beyond a descriptive analysis to a more insightful interpretation.

**Revised Conclusion (Example):**

"Ultimately, both *Evelina* and *Pride and Prejudice* caution against blindly adhering to or judging others based solely on the dictates of etiquette. While manners can provide a framework for social interaction, they should not overshadow the importance of genuine kindness, integrity, and independent thought. These novels remind us that true character lies not in flawlessly executing social rituals, but in the capacity for empathy, moral courage, and a willingness to challenge societal expectations in pursuit of personal happiness and social justice. In a world often preoccupied with appearances, the enduring lesson of Burney and Austen's work is the necessity of looking beyond the surface to discern the true worth of an individual."

By addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggestions above, you can significantly strengthen your essay and elevate it to a higher level of analysis. Remember to focus on depth, nuance, and the broader implications of your argument.
