Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-written and insightful essay that demonstrates a solid grasp of the assigned readings and the broader historiographical trends. The paper presents a clear argument about how Holt, Suny, and Reis historicize seemingly timeless concepts like race, politics, economics, and religion by emphasizing the role of culture. The writing is generally clear and sophisticated.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The paper clearly states its thesis in the introduction and maintains a consistent argument throughout. The connection between the three historians and their shared approach to historicizing through culture is well-articulated.
*   **Good Understanding of Sources:** The essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the assigned readings. You effectively summarize and analyze the key arguments of Holt, Suny, and Reis.
*   **Thoughtful Analysis:** The analysis goes beyond simple summaries and offers insightful observations about the strengths and limitations of each historian's approach. For example, the observation that Holt's work "merely exposes several roadblocks in the way of liberation" is a sharp and critical point.
*   **Strong Organization:** The paper is well-organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs dedicated to each historian, and a concluding synthesis (even if unwritten).
*   **Sophisticated Writing Style:** The language is precise and academic, and the sentence structure is varied and engaging.
*   **Effective Use of Evidence:** The essay supports its claims with relevant quotes from the sources, appropriately cited.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Engagement with "New Social History":** The introduction mentions E.P. Thompson as blazing the trail for "new social history," and later refers to "social history of the 1960s and 70s." It would be helpful to flesh out what this "new social history" actually entails. What were its key features and goals? How did it differ from earlier approaches to history? This would provide a stronger context for understanding the arguments of Holt, Suny, and Reis. This would also allow you to tie back more specifically to why these authors specifically use the term "culture" in their work to reinvigorate human agency and the "social."
*   **Comparative Analysis/Synthesis:** While each paragraph analyzes one of the 3 authors, there is very little connection or analysis between these works beyond the thesis, that all three "advocate an enhanced sensitivity to the fundamental historicity of professedly eternal themes". This should be done at the paragraph level as well as in a conclusion. Answering the following questions can help:
    *   Do the historians have different limitations? Where might one approach be stronger than the other?
    *   How might Reis's more narrowly focused case study contribute or detract from the broader arguments of Holt and Suny?
    *   What are the potential implications of this "new" approach to historical inquiry for how we understand contemporary issues?
*   **Conclusion:** The essay lacks a proper conclusion. This would be a valuable space to explicitly synthesize the insights from the three historians and to restate your overall argument. Also, what new insight does this approach offer to history, and are there any limitations to this approach?
*   **Clarity regarding references to other thinkers/works.** It is mentioned that Holt is perhaps nodding to Hannah Arendt's notion of the banality of evil, but this requires further support or elaboration.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Expand on the concept of "new social history" and its significance.
*   **Body Paragraphs:** In each paragraph, after analyzing one of the author's works, address where you see this approach being challenged or falling short. Are there blind spots in any of their analysis?
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion should synthesize the insights from the three historians, restate your thesis in a new way, and discuss any limitations of this approach.

**In summary, this is a strong essay that demonstrates a clear understanding of the assigned material and the ability to think critically about historical methodologies. By expanding on the context of "new social history," synthesizing the insights from the three historians more explicitly, and adding a conclusion, you can elevate this essay to an even higher level.**
