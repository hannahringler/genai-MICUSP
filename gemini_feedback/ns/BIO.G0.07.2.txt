Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on clarity, structure, scientific accuracy, and overall impact.

**Overall Impressions**

The paper addresses a relevant topic in microbiology and demonstrates an understanding of bacterial genetics and conjugation. However, it needs improvement in several areas to be a stronger piece of scientific writing. The analysis is somewhat limited, and some of the explanations could be more detailed and insightful. The use of outside data (Figure 1 and 2) weakens the direct connection between the methods and results.

**Specific Feedback**

**1. Abstract:**

*   **Clarity:** The abstract is okay, but it could be more concise and focused. Briefly mention the strains used in the conjugation.
*   **Missing:** Include a very brief mention of the main conclusions or implications.

**2. Introduction:**

*   **Clarity:** The introduction provides good background information, but it is a bit dense.
*   **Organization:**  The flow could be smoother. Consider starting with a broader statement about the importance of *Lactococcus lactis* in food production and then gradually narrow down to the specific focus of the study (plasmid transfer, nisin resistance).
*   **Literature Review:** The citations are good.
*   **End Statement:**  The last sentence is a good aim, but can be changed to be more specific: "The aim of this investigation was to analyze the phenotypic transfer frequency of lactose utilization, proteinase production, and nisin resistance in transconjugants of *Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis* by selection of individual markers conferred from donor plasmids."

**3. Materials and Methods:**

*   **Clarity and Completeness:**  This section needs improvement. Provide more details about the conjugation process. What was the ratio of donor to recipient cells? How long was the conjugation allowed to proceed? At what temperature?
*   **Selective Media:** Explain the purpose of each selective medium *before* you list them, rather than after. This improves readability.
*   **Strain Information:** Be explicit about antibiotic resistance.  Is StrR streptomycin resistant?
*   **Table 1:** The layout for the table makes it hard to follow.
*   **Plasmid Extraction:** Since this is a core part of the experiment, expand upon this step: "The plasmids of these transconjugants were extracted and run on an agarose gel in order to visualize the plasmids present in the transconjugant. See the detailed procedure in the Micro3021 Microbial Genetics Course Kit (Cavicchioli 2005, p. 52-55)."

**4. Results:**

*   **Data Presentation:**  The results section relies heavily on tables, which is fine, but you need to *describe* the key findings from the tables in the text. Don't just state the numbers; tell the reader what they *mean*. What's the significance of having more nisin-resistant transconjugants?
*   **Incomplete Data:** Why couldn't you complete the agarose gel analysis and plasmid extraction yourself? This is a significant issue. The results are not your own data, but from another source (Jeff Welch). The methods that you used did not generate the results. Explain this in the first paragraph of the results.
*   **Address Why It Doesn't Work:** Instead of stating that the "agarose gel phenotypic profile of our class showed that our results were not adequate to complete the report", address why they weren't adequate.

**5. Discussion:**

*   **Interpretation:** The discussion needs more in-depth analysis. It mainly summarizes the results rather than providing a critical interpretation.
*   **Explanation of Mechanisms:** Provide more detailed explanations for the observed results. For example, when discussing recombination events, explain the role of insertion sequences (IS) in more detail. How do IS elements facilitate plasmid rearrangements?
*   **Contradictions:** "These skewed results can be explained when one considers that this investigation is set up so that each of the possible phenotypes is chosen for plasmid extraction and so the rarer phenotypes appear to be more common than they actually are." This statement is a contradiction since the agarose gel electrophoresis didn't work.
*   **Incomplete Findings:** Address in the discussion section as to why you weren't able to make complete findings and explain your troubleshooting or why you couldn't address.
*   **Connections to Literature:** While you cite relevant articles, you could make stronger connections between your findings and the existing literature. Do your results support or contradict previous studies?
*   **Overstatements:** Be careful about making overly broad claims.
*   **Limitations:**  Acknowledge the limitations of the study (e.g., small sample size, reliance on external data).

**6. Tables and Figures:**

*   **Captions:**  Table captions should be descriptive.
*   **Figure Legends:** Provide detailed legends for Figures 1 and 2, explaining what each lane represents (e.g., "Lane 1: Donor strain M189; Lane 2: Recipient strain LM0203; Lanes 3-x: Transconjugants with phenotype Lac+ Prt- NisR"). Indicate the size of the marker bands on the gel image.
*   **Outside Data:** If you use someone else's data or methods, give them proper credit. State where it came from in the methods section.
*   **Lack of Figure 1 and Figure 2:** Add in the information from Welch into the table or results as a supplementary figure.
*   **Labeling on Data:** Label data where applicable.

**7. Writing Style:**

*   **Clarity and Precision:**  Use precise language and avoid ambiguity.
*   **Proofreading:**  Carefully proofread the paper for grammatical errors and typos.
*   **Scientific Tone:** Maintain a formal, objective tone throughout the paper.

**Recommendations**

1.  **Repeat or Troubleshoot:** If possible, repeat the plasmid extraction and agarose gel electrophoresis to obtain your own data.
2.  **Expand Methods:**  Provide more details about the conjugation process, selective media, and plasmid extraction.
3.  **Strengthen Results:**  Describe the key findings from the tables in the text and provide a more thorough analysis of the plasmid profiles.
4.  **Deepen Discussion:**  Provide more in-depth explanations for the observed results, connect your findings to the literature, and acknowledge the limitations of the study.

By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the quality and impact of your paper. Let me know if you have any other questions.
