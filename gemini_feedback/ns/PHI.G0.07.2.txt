Okay, I've read your paper and can offer some feedback. Here's a breakdown of strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

This is a thoughtful and well-structured essay that engages with a complex ethical problem. You clearly articulate the Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE) and its implications for evaluating the morality of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The arguments are generally well-reasoned and the writing is clear and concise. The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the philosophical concepts involved.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Structure:** You clearly state your thesis that DDE doesn't necessarily fail in the case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki because our intuitive response is influenced by morally irrelevant factors. The essay follows a logical structure, moving from explaining DDE and its proponents to addressing the specific case and ultimately offering a possible explanation for the perceived inconsistency.
*   **Good Understanding of DDE:** You demonstrate a solid grasp of the Doctrine of Double Effect and its nuances, including the different interpretations offered by Foot, Thomson, and Quinn.
*   **Well-Defined Problem:** You clearly identify the apparent conflict between the DDE's condemnation of terror bombing and the relatively common acceptance of the atomic bombings as justified.
*   **Strong Argumentation:** You present a coherent argument, challenging the notion that our intuitions about Hiroshima and Nagasaki are based purely on moral reasoning. You raise insightful points about the influence of factors like nationalism, self-interest, and the outcome of the war.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The essay is generally well-written and easy to understand. The language is precise and avoids unnecessary jargon.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Engagement with Counterarguments:** While you acknowledge the utilitarian justification for the bombings, you could strengthen the essay by directly engaging with more detailed counterarguments *against* your position. For example, you could explore different interpretations of DDE that might *still* condemn the bombings, even taking into account the wartime context.
*   **Generality of "Morally Irrelevant Factors":** While you identify factors like nationalism and self-interest, the argument could be more convincing if you provided more concrete examples of how these factors specifically influence people's judgments about the bombings. Consider specific rhetorical or historical narratives that contribute to the acceptance of the bombings.
*   **Need for Nuance in Defining "Terror Bombing":** The definition of "terror bombing" you use seems quite broad. It might be helpful to explore more nuanced definitions of terror bombing and consider whether the atomic bombings truly fit that definition in every respect. Some argue that the intent was not primarily to terrorize civilians but to target key industrial or military assets.
*   **Potential for Overgeneralization about "Majority Opinion":** You assert that the "majority of Americans" feel the bombings were justified. While this may be true, it's a broad generalization that could be supported with some evidence (e.g., public opinion polls, historical analyses).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Deepen the Analysis of DDE:** Explore specific objections to the DDE itself. Are there inherent weaknesses in the doctrine that make it difficult to apply consistently? Consider the "closeness" of the bad effect (civilian deaths) to the good effect (ending the war). Are they too closely intertwined to justify under the DDE?

*   **Provide Specific Examples of "Morally Irrelevant Factors" at Work:**

    *   **Nationalism:** Discuss specific wartime propaganda or rhetoric that framed the Japanese as the enemy and dehumanized them, making it easier to accept civilian casualties.
    *   **Self-Interest:** Explore how the desire for revenge after Pearl Harbor or the relief at avoiding a costly invasion might have influenced people's judgments.
    *   **Outcome Bias:** Analyze how the fact that the Allies won the war and the bombings led to a relatively quick end might have retrospectively justified the decision in people's minds.

*   **Refine the Definition of Terror Bombing:** Research different definitions of terror bombing and discuss whether the atomic bombings fully meet the criteria. Consider the arguments that the primary targets were military or industrial, even if civilian casualties were inevitable.

*   **Address Potential Objections:**

    *   **The Argument from Necessity:** Some argue that the bombings were the *only* way to end the war and save lives. Address this argument directly. Was there truly no alternative?
    *   **The Moral Equivalence of Wartime Actions:** Some might argue that all wartime actions involve killing and that the atomic bombings were no different in principle from other forms of warfare. Respond to this argument by highlighting the unique scale and nature of the destruction caused by the atomic bombs.

*   **Consider Alternative Ethical Frameworks:** While you focus on DDE, briefly mentioning other ethical frameworks (e.g., consequentialism, virtue ethics) could broaden the discussion and strengthen your argument.

*   **Strengthen the Conclusion:** The conclusion is good, but you could make it even stronger by summarizing your main points and offering a more definitive statement about the implications of your analysis. For example, what does this say about the role of emotions and biases in moral reasoning in general?

**Specific Comments on Sections:**

*   **Introduction:** Good introduction that clearly sets out the problem and your thesis.
*   **Explanation of DDE:** Clear and accurate explanation of the doctrine and its proponents.
*   **Analysis of Hiroshima and Nagasaki:** This is the core of the essay, and it's generally well-done. However, it could be strengthened by addressing the weaknesses outlined above.
*   **Conclusion:** A thoughtful conclusion that summarizes your argument and reflects on the limitations of human moral reasoning.

By addressing these points, you can elevate your essay from a good analysis to a truly compelling and insightful exploration of a complex ethical issue. Good luck!
