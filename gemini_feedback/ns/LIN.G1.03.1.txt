Okay, I've reviewed the paper. Here's a breakdown of feedback, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles a complex topic in syntax with a decent level of engagement. It demonstrates an understanding of the VP-internal vs. VP-external subject debate, the core arguments, and relevant data. However, the paper could be significantly strengthened by:

*   **Greater Clarity and Precision:**  The explanations often feel dense and could benefit from simplification and more explicit connections between concepts.
*   **More Robust Argumentation:** While the paper favors the VP-internal hypothesis, the reasoning could be more forceful and persuasive. Address counterarguments more directly.
*   **Improved Structure and Flow:**  The organization is generally sound, but transitions between topics and sub-arguments could be smoother.
*   **More Concrete Examples:** While there are some examples, particularly concerning floating quantifiers, adding more simple illustrative examples throughout would make the paper more accessible.

**Strengths:**

*   **Topic Selection:**  The topic is significant in syntactic theory.
*   **Understanding of Core Concepts:** The paper demonstrates a grasp of D-structure, S-structure, theta-role assignment, m-command, floating quantifiers, and PRO.
*   **Engagement with Literature:** The paper cites relevant work by Chomsky, Lasnik, Sportiche, Haegeman, and Jackendoff.
*   **Logical Progression:** The paper generally follows a logical order, starting with the basic hypotheses and moving to more complex issues.

**Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Clarity and Accessibility:**

    *   **Define Terms More Explicitly:** While you likely assume a certain level of background knowledge from your audience, briefly defining key terms *when you first introduce them* can significantly improve clarity. For example, define D-structure and S-structure in a simple sentence or two when you first mention them.  Define "m-command".
    *   **Simplify Explanations:** Some explanations are too condensed. Break down complex ideas into smaller, more manageable steps. Use more transitional phrases (e.g., "Therefore," "In contrast," "Furthermore," "This means that...") to guide the reader.
    *   **Provide More Examples:**  Illustrate theoretical points with simple, clear examples. For instance, when discussing theta-role assignment, provide more straightforward examples of how verbs assign roles to their arguments. Don't rely solely on the floating quantifier example.
    *   **"So What?" Factor:**  Constantly ask yourself, "Why does this matter?"  Make the *relevance* of each point explicit. Why is the VP-internal vs. VP-external debate important for our understanding of language?

2.  **Argumentation:**

    *   **Stronger Thesis Statement:**  The introduction states that the paper will discuss the two hypotheses. While the conclusion indicates a preference for the VP-internal hypothesis, consider making this preference clearer in the introduction as a *thesis statement*. This will give the paper a stronger sense of purpose.
    *   **Address Counterarguments More Directly:**  While you mention some potential problems with the VP-internal hypothesis (e.g., the complexities with PRO), consider explicitly addressing potential *advantages* of the VP-external hypothesis. Then, explain why you find the VP-internal arguments more compelling.
    *   **Develop Arguments More Fully:**  Don't just state a point; *argue* for it. Provide evidence, reasoning, and support for your claims.
    *   **Be More Critical:** Don't just present Sportiche's analysis of floating quantifiers; critically evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Are there any alternative explanations? Are there any empirical problems with his account?
    *   **Connect Back to the Thesis:** At the end of each section, explicitly connect your findings back to your overall argument. How does this section support your claim that the VP-internal hypothesis is superior?

3.  **Structure and Flow:**

    *   **Clearer Transitions:**  Use transition sentences at the end of paragraphs and sections to signal the shift to the next topic.
    *   **Topic Sentences:**  Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea.
    *   **Consider Subheadings:** Breaking up larger sections with subheadings can improve readability and organization.  For example, you could have subheadings within the "PRO and Problems" section.
    *   **Summarize Complex Arguments:** Before moving on to the next point, briefly summarize the key takeaways from the previous discussion.

4.  **Specific Comments on Sections:**

    *   **Introduction:** Strengthen the thesis statement. Briefly outline the main arguments you will present in favor of the VP-internal hypothesis.
    *   **Theta-Role Assignment:** This section is crucial, but it's a bit dense. Provide simpler examples of how theta roles are assigned under each hypothesis. Explain *why* it's problematic for the V head to not m-command the subject in the VP-external account.
    *   **Floating Quantifiers:** This is a good section, but you could be more critical. Does Sportiche's analysis account for all cases of floating quantifiers? Are there any alternative explanations?
    *   **PRO and Problems:** This section is quite complex and difficult to follow. Break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Clearly explain the problem of overgeneration with PRO and why PRO is assumed to be ungoverned. Then, explain how the VP-internal hypothesis attempts to address this problem, and why it ultimately falls short. Consider adding a figure illustrating the proposed IP adjunct structure for PRO. Make sure to state what is a hypothesis and what is fact.
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize your main arguments in favor of the VP-internal hypothesis. Briefly acknowledge the remaining problems (e.g., with PRO), but reiterate why you believe the VP-internal hypothesis is the better option overall.

5.  **Formatting and Style:**

    *   **Proofread Carefully:**  Check for typos and grammatical errors.
    *   **Maintain Consistent Formatting:** Ensure that your citations and bibliography are formatted consistently according to a recognized style guide (e.g., APA, MLA).

**Example of Improvement:**

**Original:**

"The VP-internal subjects hypothesis claims that the subject starts in a position immediately dominated by the VP and then moves to [Spec, IP]."

**Improved:**

"In contrast to the VP-external hypothesis, the VP-internal subjects hypothesis proposes that the subject originates *within* the verb phrase (VP). Specifically, the subject is base-generated in a position immediately dominated by the VP. To satisfy requirements of case and agreement, the subject then moves to the [Spec, IP] position. This movement is a key difference between the two hypotheses."

(Note the added explanation of *why* the movement occurs and the explicit connection to the other hypothesis.)

By addressing these points, you can significantly enhance the clarity, persuasiveness, and overall quality of your paper. Good luck!
