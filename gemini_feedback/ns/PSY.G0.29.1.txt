Okay, I can give you feedback on this paper. I'll focus on areas where improvements can be made, keeping in mind this is a student paper.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the core concepts related to immigration and applies them to the experiences of three individuals. The structure is logical, and the writing is generally clear. However, some areas could be strengthened for a more compelling and insightful analysis.

**Here's a breakdown of areas for improvement:**

**1. Introduction:**

*   **Stronger Thesis Statement:** While the introduction outlines the paper's goals, the thesis statement could be more focused and arguable.  Instead of simply stating the paper will "discuss all of these issues...and come to a conclusion about what immigrants face...", consider stating a specific argument about the *relative importance* of certain factors (gender, family, generational differences, etc.) or a particular *outcome* of the immigrant experience that you will demonstrate.  For example: "While multiple factors influence an immigrant's experience, strong family ties, particularly in the form of transnational support networks, prove to be the most significant predictor of successful adaptation and well-being in a new cultural environment." This gives you a clear direction and a point to prove.

**2. Use of Theory:**

*   **Deeper Engagement with the Literature:** You introduce the theories well, but sometimes the application feels a bit superficial. Instead of just stating that an interviewee's experience "follows" or "is contrary to" a theory, *explain why*. How does this specific detail from the interview *illuminate* or *complicate* the theory? What nuances are revealed?
*   **Synthesis of Theories:**  Go beyond simply applying each theory in isolation.  Look for connections *between* the theories. How do gender dynamics and family structures interact? How does transnationalism influence generational differences?  Show how these concepts work together in the lived experiences of your participants.

**3. Analysis of Interview Data:**

*   **More Specific Examples:**  Use concrete details from the interviews to illustrate your points.  Instead of saying "He has maintained a close connectionâ€¦," provide a specific example of how he maintains that connection and what the impact of that connection is. For example, "Benji's weekly Skype calls with his grandmother in Bangladesh, where they discuss religious practices and family news, provide him with a crucial link to his cultural identity and a sense of belonging, mitigating the feelings of isolation he sometimes experiences on campus."
*   **Critical Analysis, not just Description:** Don't just summarize what the interviewees said. Analyze the *meaning* and *significance* of their statements.  What are the underlying assumptions, motivations, or contradictions revealed in their narratives?
*   **Addressing Contradictions:** You correctly identify contradictions between the experiences of the interviewees and the theoretical frameworks.  That's good! Now, delve deeper. What explains these contradictions? Do they suggest limitations in the theories themselves, or do they reflect the complexities of individual experiences?

**4. Generational Differences:**

*   **Deeper Dive:** The analysis of generational differences is promising, but could be expanded. Consider exploring how the *specific historical context* in which each immigrant arrived (e.g., political climate, economic opportunities, social attitudes) shaped their experiences and perspectives.
*   **Consider Intersectionality:** Think about how generational differences might interact with gender and family dynamics.

**5. Discussion:**

*   **Connect to the Thesis:** Make sure the discussion section directly addresses your revised thesis statement. Summarize your findings, but more importantly, explain how your analysis *proves* or *supports* your argument.
*   **Broader Implications:** Discuss the broader implications of your findings. What can we learn from these individual stories about immigration in general?  What are the policy implications? What further research is needed?

**6. Limitations:**

*   **Be Specific:** You mentioned that "Some questions were phrased differently." Give examples of questions and how these difference might effect the results.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Running Head:** Make sure the running head conforms to the specified requirements (usually all caps, abbreviated title, and page number).
*   **Avoid generalizations:** Be careful about making broad statements about "most immigrants." Qualify your statements with phrases like "many immigrants," "some immigrants," or "immigrants in these cases."
*   **Proofread carefully:** Look for any grammatical errors or typos.

**In summary, this is a solid paper that demonstrates a good grasp of the material. By strengthening the thesis, engaging more deeply with the literature, providing more specific examples from the interviews, and developing a more nuanced analysis, you can elevate this paper to the next level.**

Good luck! Let me know if you have any other questions.
