Okay, I can provide some feedback on this essay analyzing Andrew Marvell's "The Definition of Love."  Here's a breakdown of strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the poem and presents a clear, arguable thesis.  The student identifies the key themes of impossibility and the paradoxical nature of love, supporting these ideas with textual evidence and analysis. The writing is generally clear and grammatically sound. However, some areas could be strengthened for a more compelling and insightful analysis.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The essay establishes a clear thesis statement in the first paragraph, arguing that Marvell's poem defines love through its impossibility and flawed nature.
*   **Strong Argument:** The essay develops a logical argument, supporting the thesis with specific examples from the poem. The focus on "impossibility" is consistent throughout.
*   **Textual Evidence:** The essay uses direct quotations from the poem to support its claims, demonstrating close reading skills.
*   **Analysis of Poetic Devices:** The essay identifies and analyzes specific poetic devices, such as personification, abstraction, and metaphor (parallel lines), to support its interpretation.
*   **Organization:** The essay is well-organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Each paragraph focuses on a specific aspect of the argument.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The writing is generally clear and easy to understand. The student uses appropriate academic vocabulary.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the essay identifies key elements, some of the analysis could be more in-depth. For example, when discussing the metaphor of parallel lines, delve deeper into the implications of "oblique" lines versus "parallel" lines. What does this say about compromise, imperfection, and the nature of relationships?

*   **Elaborate on the significance of Fate:** While the essay mentions Fate as a barrier to perfect love, explore the cultural and philosophical context of Fate in Marvell's time. What did Fate represent, and why was it seen as such a powerful force? Why does Fate only target 'perfect love'?

*   **Explore the Paradox More Fully:** The essay mentions the paradoxical nature of love but could explore this concept more deeply. How does Marvell use language and imagery to create a sense of paradox? What is the effect of this paradox on the reader? How can "opposition" and "conjunction" exist together? What does it mean?

*   **Footnote Reference:** The footnote reference seems a little out of place and could be better integrated into the main text. Instead of just stating what the footnote said, explain why that information is important and how it strengthens your argument. You can simply embed the information within the paragraph.

*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the main points but could be more impactful. Try to offer a more profound concluding thought about the poem's lasting significance or its relevance to our understanding of love. How does Marvell's definition of love challenge or reinforce traditional views?

*   **Grammar/Word Choice:**
    *   "In the end, it seems Fate, with her “decrees of steal,” is the force that definitively determines the outcome of the love in question (17). Because Fate “enviously debars" the love, and fate is completely out of one's control, then it seems the conjunction Marvell refers to will not occur." can be simplified and made more direct.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Parallel Lines:**  Elaborate: What are the *emotional* implications of being "truly parallel?"  Is there a sense of longing, frustration, or a different kind of beauty?  How does this contrast with the messier, more human experience of "oblique" love?

*   **Fate:** Dig deeper: Is Fate simply a negative force? Could it be argued that Fate, in its "tyrannical" way, *preserves* the ideal of perfect love by preventing its corruption through real-world interaction? Is Marvell suggesting that the *idea* of perfect love is more valuable than its realization?

*   **The Ending:** Analyze the final lines more closely: The "conjunction of the mind, / And opposition of the stars" is a very complex image. Is this a resigned acceptance of the impossibility of love, or is there a hint of defiance in the idea that the *mind* can still find connection even if the stars are opposed?

**Revised Conclusion Example (to illustrate a more impactful ending):**

>In "The Definition of Love," Andrew Marvell doesn't offer a comforting portrait of romantic fulfillment. Instead, he presents a love perpetually defined by its own impossibility. Through paradoxical imagery and stark pronouncements of Fate's dominion, Marvell suggests that the very *idea* of perfect love may be more potent, more enduring, than any earthly manifestation. The poem's enduring power lies in its unflinching exploration of love's inherent contradictions, reminding us that even in its absence, the pursuit of the ideal continues to shape our understanding of human connection.

**In summary:**

This is a solid essay that demonstrates a good understanding of Marvell's poem. By delving deeper into the analysis, exploring the philosophical implications, and crafting a more impactful conclusion, the student can elevate this essay to a higher level. Good job!
