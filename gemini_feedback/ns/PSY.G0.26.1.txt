Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper and suggestions for improvement.  I'll focus on clarity, argumentation, structure, and areas where the writing could be sharpened.

**Overall Impression**

This is a thoughtful and well-written critique.  You demonstrate a good understanding of Whorf's argument and engage with it in a nuanced way.  The paper raises interesting questions about the nature of metaphysics, the role of culture, and the limitations of our own perspectives. However, the argument is somewhat meandering and could benefit from a more focused central thesis and a clearer structure.

**Strengths**

*   **Engagement with the Text:** You clearly understand Whorf's argument and provide specific examples from the text to support your analysis.
*   **Critical Thinking:** You raise insightful questions about Whorf's claims and offer alternative interpretations.
*   **Original Ideas:** You introduce your own ideas and explore their implications, such as the connection between metaphysics and brain structure.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and uses sophisticated language.

**Areas for Improvement**

1.  **Thesis Statement:** The paper lacks a clear, concise thesis statement. What is the central argument you are making about Whorf's work? Are you arguing that his claims are too strong? That his methodology is flawed? That his conclusions are ultimately untestable? A strong thesis statement will provide a roadmap for the reader and help you to focus your analysis.

    *   **Suggestion:** Formulate a clear thesis in the introduction that explicitly states your overall assessment of Whorf's argument. For example: "While Whorf's exploration of the Hopi concept of time raises important questions about the influence of language on thought, his claims are ultimately undermined by [specific reasons, e.g., a lack of empirical evidence, methodological limitations, an overemphasis on cultural difference]."

2.  **Structure and Organization:** The paper's structure is somewhat loose. The points you raise are interesting, but they don't always flow logically from one to the next. It feels a bit like a series of insightful observations rather than a tightly constructed argument.

    *   **Suggestion:** Create a more explicit structure with clear transitions between paragraphs and sections. Consider grouping related ideas together.  You could structure the paper around specific aspects of Whorf's argument (e.g., his claims about time, his comparison to physics, his implications for metaphysics). Each section could then present Whorf's view, your critique, and supporting evidence.
    *   **Example Structure:**
        *   **Introduction:** Thesis statement, brief overview of Whorf's argument.
        *   **Section 1: Critique of Whorf's Claim about Time:** Present Whorf's claim, your counterarguments (e.g., Hopi still have a sense of past/future), evidence from the text.
        *   **Section 2: Critique of Whorf's Analogy to Physics:** Explain Whorf's analogy, your reasons for finding it flawed, alternative interpretations.
        *   **Section 3: Implications for Metaphysics (Idealism vs. Realism):** Discuss Whorf's implications, your thoughts on whether his thesis could lead to a purely man-made view of the universe.
        *   **Section 4: Untestability of claims and the limits of knowing:** Discuss challenges of fully understanding the Hopi culture, and how Whorf's claims are mostly unprovable and untestable.
        *   **Conclusion:** Restate your thesis, summarize your main points, and offer concluding thoughts.

3.  **Develop Arguments More Fully:** Some of your critiques are presented as interesting observations, but they could be developed into stronger arguments with more supporting evidence and analysis.

    *   **Example:** Your critique of Whorf's analogy to Euclidean geometry and relativity is a good starting point. To strengthen this argument, you could:
        *   Explain in more detail *why* the analogy fails. What are the key differences between the two situations?
        *   Provide additional examples or evidence to support your claim that relativity is "more complete and more powerful" than Euclidean geometry.
        *   Explore the implications of this flawed analogy for Whorf's overall argument.
    *   **Example:** The connection you draw between metaphysics and brain structure is fascinating. To develop this idea, you could:
        *   Research existing studies on the relationship between culture, language, and brain development.
        *   Discuss the ethical implications of such research.
        *   Acknowledge the speculative nature of the connection, but explain its potential significance.

4.  **Address Counterarguments:** While you raise some good points, it would be helpful to anticipate and address potential counterarguments to your claims. This will make your argument more persuasive and demonstrate that you have considered the issue from multiple perspectives.

    *   **Example:** If you argue that the Hopi still have a sense of time, even if it's different from our own, acknowledge that Whorf might argue that this sense is fundamentally different and doesn't qualify as "time" in the traditional sense. Then, explain why you disagree.

5.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** While the writing is generally good, there are some areas where it could be more clear and concise. Avoid jargon and unnecessary complexity.

    *   **Example:** Phrases like "the normal metaphysics" could be defined more clearly. What do you mean by this term?

6.  **Specificity:** In some places, the paper relies on general statements. Try to be more specific and provide concrete examples to support your claims.

    *   **Example:** Instead of saying "the Hopi can describe phenomena and events in the world fluently," provide a specific example of how they do this.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Introduction:** Add a thesis statement.
*   **Paragraph 2:** "However, the Hopi can describe phenomena and events in the world fluently. This implies that there are many possible, legitimate ways of perceiving the universe, rather than a 'normal' view." *This could be your thesis, but more clearly stated.*
*   **Paragraph 3:** The argument that the Hopi do not perceive time as flowing needs stronger support. Consider exploring Whorf's specific examples of Hopi language and how they relate to his claim.
*   **Paragraph 4:** The metaphysics argument is insightful. Tie it more directly back to Whorf's claims.
*   **Paragraph 5:** The analogy to colorblindness is interesting. Develop it further and explain its limitations.
*   **Paragraph 6:** Re-evaluate legitimacy of a metaphysics by positivist science. Is this a fair criterion?
*   **Paragraph 7:** The discussion of Hopi concept of time in relation to past/present/future needs to be clarified. How does this challenge Whorf's claim?
*   **Paragraph 8:** Explain how Hopi perception of simultaneity undermines the concept of universal time.
*   **Conclusion:** Summarize your main arguments and restate your thesis.

**In summary, focus on:**

*   **A Stronger Thesis:** Clearly state your argument.
*   **Tighter Structure:** Organize your ideas logically.
*   **Deeper Development:** Provide more evidence and analysis.
*   **Addressing Counterarguments:** Consider opposing viewpoints.
*   **Clarity and Specificity:** Use precise language and concrete examples.

By addressing these areas, you can strengthen your critique and create a more compelling and persuasive argument. Good luck!
