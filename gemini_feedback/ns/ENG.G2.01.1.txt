Okay, I've read the paper and I can provide some feedback. Here's a breakdown of its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

This is a sophisticated and insightful analysis of H. Rider Haggard's *She*, placing it within the complex social, political, and religious context of late 19th-century England. The paper successfully argues that Haggard's representation of Jews in the novel is related to contemporary debates about degeneration, imperialism, and messianism. The analysis is well-researched, drawing on a variety of secondary sources, and the arguments are generally well-supported by textual evidence.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis:** The paper has a clear and arguable thesis about Haggard's "semitic discourse" in *She* and its connection to broader cultural anxieties.
*   **Contextualization:** The paper does an excellent job of contextualizing *She* within the historical, social, and intellectual climate of late 19th-century England. The discussion of the "Jewish question," debates about degeneration, and the rise of Zionism is particularly effective.
*   **Use of Secondary Sources:** The paper draws on a wide range of relevant secondary sources, including works by Cheyette, Endelman, Ragussis, Freedman, Deleuze, and Silverman, among others. These sources are used effectively to support the argument and to provide theoretical frameworks for analysis.
*   **Close Reading:** The paper engages in close readings of specific passages from *She*, demonstrating a careful attention to detail and an ability to interpret the text in light of its historical context.
*   **Sophisticated Argument:** The paper develops a complex and nuanced argument about the relationship between Haggard's representation of Jews, his anxieties about degeneration and imperialism, and his exploration of messianic themes.
*   **Engagement with Critical Debate:** The paper demonstrates an awareness of existing critical interpretations of *She* and engages with them in a thoughtful and productive way.
*   **Clear and Organized:** The paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a logical progression of ideas.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Overly Dense and Complex:** At times, the paper can be overly dense and complex, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument. Some sentences are long and convoluted, and the use of specialized terminology can be intimidating.
*   **Repetitive:** There are instances of repetition, particularly in the restatement of the thesis and the summary of key arguments.
*   **Some connections feel slightly tenuous:** While the overall argument is strong, some of the specific connections drawn between Haggard's personal life (e.g., his ancestry) and his representation of Jews in the novel feel slightly speculative.
*   **Uneven Focus:** While the analysis of Ayesha's waiting and its connection to messianism and masochism is insightful, it could be more fully integrated into the broader argument about Haggard's "semitic discourse." The connection between these two strands of the argument is not always clear.
*   **Limited Discussion of Counterarguments:** While the paper acknowledges the complexity of Haggard's attitudes towards Jews, it could benefit from a more explicit discussion of potential counterarguments or alternative interpretations.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Simplify Language and Sentence Structure:** Aim for greater clarity and conciseness in your writing. Break up long sentences into shorter ones, and avoid using overly specialized terminology unless it is absolutely necessary.
*   **Reduce Repetition:** Review the paper carefully and eliminate any instances of unnecessary repetition.
*   **Strengthen Connections:** Make the connections between Haggard's personal life and his literary representations more explicit and convincing. Provide more concrete evidence to support these claims.
*   **Integrate Argument:** More clearly integrate the analysis of Ayesha's waiting and messianic masochism into the broader argument about Haggard's "semitic discourse." Explain how these themes are related to the representation of Jews in the novel.
*   **Address Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments to your thesis. This will strengthen your argument and demonstrate your awareness of the complexity of the issue.
*   **Consider a Stronger Conclusion:** The conclusion could be more forceful and leave the reader with a clearer sense of the significance of your analysis. Summarize the main points of your argument and offer some concluding thoughts about the broader implications of Haggard's representation of Jews in *She*.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper carefully for any grammatical errors or typos.

**Specific Examples:**

*   **Page 1, Paragraph 2:** The sentence beginning "The discussions surrounding..." is a bit long and could be broken up for clarity.
*   **Page 2, Paragraph 2:** The sentence beginning "The meshing and confusion..." is also quite dense.
*   **Page 4, Paragraph 1:** The connection between Haggard's ancestry and his "personal stake" in discussions about Jews could be elaborated on.
*   **Page 5, Paragraph 2:** The sentence beginning "Whatever his personal stake..." is a good summary, but it could be made more concise.
*   **Throughout the paper:** Consider replacing some of the more specialized terms (e.g., "allosemitism," "incarnadined") with simpler language.

**In summary, this is a well-researched and insightful paper that makes a valuable contribution to the study of H. Rider Haggard's *She*. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above, you can further strengthen your argument and make your analysis even more compelling.**

I hope this feedback is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
