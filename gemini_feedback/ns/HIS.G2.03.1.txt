Okay, here's some feedback on your paper.  I'll break it down into strengths and areas for improvement, along with specific suggestions.

**Overall Impression**

This is a strong response paper that demonstrates a good understanding of the assigned readings and their broader context.  You effectively synthesize the arguments of Springer and Breines, connecting them to relevant historical issues and other scholarly perspectives.  The paper also raises interesting questions and engages in critical analysis.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis/Focus:**  You establish a clear focus in the first paragraph, outlining the central questions and themes you will address (the meaning of "woman's issue", the marginalization of black feminist history, and the impact of historical narratives).
*   **Effective Synthesis:**  You skillfully weave together the arguments of Springer and Breines, highlighting points of convergence and divergence.
*   **Critical Analysis:**  You go beyond simply summarizing the readings, engaging in critical analysis of the authors' arguments and their implications.  You challenge assumptions, raise pertinent questions, and offer insightful interpretations. For example, the questions about the impact of slavery on black men and women and the rhetoric of black nationalism are well-developed.
*   **Historical Context:** You demonstrate a good understanding of the historical context of the Black Power movement and its relationship to feminism.
*   **Thought-Provoking Questions:** You raise a number of insightful questions that demonstrate critical thinking and a desire to delve deeper into the complexities of the topic. The questions about Black women coming to Black feminism on their own is a thought provoking section.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper is logically organized, with a clear flow of ideas from one paragraph to the next.
*   **Strong Use of Evidence:** You effectively incorporate quotes from the texts to support your claims.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Specificity:** While your analysis is insightful, some points could benefit from greater specificity.
*   **Clarity:** In a few places, the writing could be more concise and direct.
*   **Concluding Strength:** Consider ending on a higher note, perhaps reinforcing your main points and offering a concluding thought about the significance of black feminist historiography.

**Specific Suggestions**

1.  **Specificity - First Paragraph:**
    *   When you say Springer "interrogates the question of what constitutes a 'woman's issue,'" give a brief, concrete example of what she finds. This will make your intro even more impactful.
    *   In that first paragraph, you state the "wave" formation of historical feminist movements has been centered on white women. It would be helpful to state more clearly what that means and how that marginalizes Black women.

2.  **Specificity - Second Paragraph:**
    *   "Why was there no call during Black Power for men to discuss how badly slavery had brutalized black women as well?" This is a powerful question. Explore the possible answers to this questions. What specific aspects of masculine nationalism might explain this?
    *   "Just as the wave analogy serves to continue to marginalize women of color fighting gender oppression, the 1960s assumption that black men suffered more during slavery served to rationalize black women's modern day subordination."
        *   Be more specific. How does it do so exactly?
        *   Who does it do so for?
        *   What kind of subordination?

3.  **Specificity - Third Paragraph:**
    *   "Why was white men's tradition of protecting and subordinating â€˜their' women replicated in black nationalist rhetoric?" Could there be space for women to raise children as well as lead on the frontlines?"
        *   Could there be space?
        *   What kind of space?

4.  **Clarity:**
    *   The sentence starting with, "After reading these books together with the articles on women in the Black Power movement a few weeks ago..." could be more concisely phrased. Perhaps something like, "The historiography of black feminism reveals an ongoing debate..."

5.  **Strengthening the Conclusion:**
    *   Your concluding question ("Was this primarily due to the image of the black matriarch...") is a good starting point, but consider expanding on this. What are the long-term consequences of this tension between black feminism and the black community? What does this suggest about the challenges facing black feminists today?

**Revised Example (Incorporating Suggestions)**

Here's an example of how you could revise one section to increase specificity:

**Original:**
"Just as the wave analogy serves to continue to marginalize women of color fighting gender oppression, the 1960s assumption that black men suffered more during slavery served to rationalize black women's modern day subordination."

**Revised:**
"Just as the wave analogy served to continue to marginalize women of color fighting gender oppression by focusing the narrative on white, middle-class experiences, the 1960s assumption that black men suffered more during slavery served to rationalize black women's subordination *within* the Black Power movement. The assumption served to silence concerns for Black Women, creating an excuse for men to take more of a lead role and ignore women's concerns within the Civil Rights movement."

**In Summary**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that demonstrates a strong understanding of the material. By addressing the suggestions for improvement, you can further strengthen your analysis and create an even more compelling and impactful response.
