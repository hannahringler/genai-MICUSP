Here's some feedback on the paper "Carwin and the Imp: Perversity and Atmosphere in Wieland," considering its strengths and areas for improvement.

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The paper establishes a clear thesis (Carwin embodies Poe's "imp of the perverse," creating an anarchic atmosphere that influences Wieland) and sustains this argument throughout.
*   **Strong Textual Evidence:** The paper is well-supported with specific textual examples from Brown's *Wieland*. You effectively integrate quotes to illustrate Carwin's actions, motivations, and the resulting atmosphere.
*   **Good Understanding of Literary Concepts:** You demonstrate a solid grasp of concepts like "imp of the perverse," Gothic tradition, and the role of atmosphere in literature.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The analysis goes beyond simply identifying perversity; you explore *how* Carwin creates a destabilizing atmosphere and *why* this is significant to the novel's impact. The connection between Carwin's actions and Wieland's descent into madness is compelling.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure, moving from a general introduction of the concept to specific examples of Carwin's behavior and its consequences.
*   **Clear and Concise Writing:** The prose is generally clear and easy to follow, allowing the argument to shine through.

**Areas for Improvement and Suggestions:**

*   **Deeper Exploration of "Atmosphere":** While you mention atmosphere throughout, you could explore it more directly as a literary device. How *exactly* does Carwin's presence create a sense of unease, irrationality, and impending doom? Consider using specific words, imagery, or recurring motifs that contribute to the atmosphere. This is the core of your thesis, so strengthening this aspect will significantly enhance the paper.
*   **Nuance in Defining "Perversity":**  The paper relies heavily on Poe's definition, which is a good starting point. However, consider if there are other layers or nuances to the concept of perversity that apply to Carwin and *Wieland*. For instance, is there a suggestion of sexual perversity, or a perversion of religious faith?
*   **Address Counterarguments or Complexity:** The paper largely presents a straightforward argument.  Consider briefly acknowledging alternative interpretations or potential complexities. For example:
    *   Could Carwin be seen as *unintentionally* creating chaos? Addressing this possibility strengthens your argument by showing you've considered other viewpoints.
    *   Is there a psychological reason that Carwin continues his immoral behaviour?

*   **Specificity about Carwin's "Education":** You state Carwin's education is evident to Clara and the rest of the family, making him wilfully aware of social norms. Elaboration on what aspects of his speech or behaviour indicate his education will strengthen the argument.
*   **Conclusion Specificity:** The ending summarizes well but could be slightly stronger by offering a final, more impactful takeaway about Carwin's role in the novel's overall meaning or lasting effect.

**Specific Line Edits/Considerations:**

*   "In one of his famous short stories, Edgar Allen Poe defined perverseness as the completion of an action for the reason that it should not be done." Consider rephrasing for conciseness. Perhaps: "Edgar Allan Poe defined perverseness as the deliberate commission of a forbidden act."
*   "His irresponsible choices and decision to continue using his biloquism lead to the creation of..." --> "His choices and *continued* use of biloquism create..."
*   "This decision to contribute to the family discussion about the mysterious voices is extremely perverse, as is the fact that he basically explains to the family how he tricked them with ventriloquism by professing a belief in a “human agent” attached to the voices (85)." This is a good point, but it's slightly wordy. Consider breaking it into two sentences or rephrasing for clarity.
*   “Religion is Wieland's way of dealing with the mysterious voice, and his assumption that God is speaking to him when it is actually Carwin leads Wieland down a dangerous path." Consider rephrasing, perhaps: "Wieland's reliance on religious interpretation, coupled with his assumption that God is speaking through the voice, leads him down a dangerous path."
*   "Gothic novels tend to relate stories of a father's or grandfather's sins being passed down to a current generation, who must pay for past mistakes." While true, consider adding a specific example to illustrate this point and make it more concrete.
*   “makes Wieland even more powerful." --> "makes *Wieland's tragic outcome* even more powerful."

**In summary:**

This is a well-written and insightful paper with a clear thesis and strong textual support. By deepening the analysis of "atmosphere," exploring the nuances of perversity, and addressing potential counterarguments, you can elevate this paper to an even higher level. Good job!
