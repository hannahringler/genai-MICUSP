Here's a breakdown of the paper's strengths and areas for improvement, along with suggestions:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Engagement:** The paper demonstrates a strong personal engagement with Walker Percy's ideas. The writer connects the concepts to personal experiences, which makes the analysis more insightful and relatable.
*   **Comprehensive Summary:** The paper effectively summarizes the main points of Percy's chapter in a clear and organized way. The division into parts is helpful.
*   **Application of Concepts:** The writer skillfully applies Percy's concepts (e.g., the loss of sovereignty, the role of experts, double-deprivation) to various examples, demonstrating a good understanding of the material.
*   **Thoughtful Insights:** The paper contains several thought-provoking insights. For example, the connection between the need to capture experiences (through photos) and the failure to fully appreciate the present is well-articulated. The analogy between students' pursuit of high grades and the desire for expert approval is also interesting.
*   **Clear Writing:** The writing is generally clear and easy to follow.
*   **Clear Structure**: The paper follows a sensible structure, making it easy to follow the arguments and examples.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Critical Depth:** While the paper summarizes and connects Percy's ideas to personal experiences, it could benefit from a deeper critical analysis.
    *   **Question Assumptions:** Does the writer question any of Percy's assumptions? Are there limitations to Percy's arguments?
    *   **Offer Counterarguments:** Are there alternative perspectives on the issues Percy raises? For instance, could pre-packaged experiences have some benefits (e.g., accessibility, safety)?
    *   **Elaborate on Implications:** How does Percy's analysis relate to broader societal trends (e.g., consumerism, media influence, education)?
*   **Specificity of Examples:** In some instances, the personal examples could be more specific and detailed to better illustrate the concepts.
    *   For the revisiting the school walk, what specifically made it scenic beyond "flowering trees"?
    *   How did those negative expectations play out during later museum visits?
*   **Academic Tone and Precision:** While the personal tone is engaging, at times, the language can be informal.
    *   **Avoid Filler/Informal Phrases:** Phrases like "I enjoyed this reading very much" or "This struck me as being relevant to my own life" are acceptable, but not necessary.
    *   **Avoid Excessive Qualification:** Overusing phrases like "somewhat," "I guess," or "maybe" can weaken the impact of the arguments.
    *   **Clear and Concise Language:** Aim for more concise and precise language.
*   **Connecting Personal Experiences to Academic Arguments:** While the personal anecdotes are engaging, strengthen the connection between those experiences and Percy's academic arguments. You can explain how your experiences challenged or reinforced the concepts you are discussing.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Although it's engaging, the introduction could briefly state Percy's main thesis and how the paper will engage with it (e.g., "This paper will explore Percy's critique of commodified experience and consider how it applies to both structured environments like education and leisure activities like travel.")
*   **Grand Canyon Example:** Consider offering an alternative view to explain why people visit the Grand Canyon, even if they are tourists. Are they seeking awe, escape, or social connection, beyond just checking a box?
*   **Will Smith Movie:** The example of "I Am Legend" is interesting, but needs more grounding in Percy's argument.  *How* does the isolation in the movie relate to removing pre-packaged expectations?
*   **Museum example**: Explain what specifically disappointed you on later visits to the Museum compared to the first visit.
*   **Mexican Village Example:** Push the analysis of the couple's anxiety further. Why are they so anxious? What are they afraid of losing?  Connect this anxiety more directly to Percy's concept of the "loss of the creature."
*   **Dogfish Dissection:** Elaborate on how Percy's proposed educational technique could combat double deprivation. What specific skills or insights would students gain?
*   **Conclusion:** End with a stronger, more definitive statement about the implications of Percy's work.  Perhaps discuss how his ideas can be applied to improve the quality of our experiences in a world increasingly dominated by pre-packaged events.
    *   **Instead of**:  "Maybe then we can attempt to unpackage the true experience."
    *   **Try**: "By recognizing the forces that shape our experiences, and by actively seeking new perspectives, we can strive to overcome the loss of sovereignty and reclaim the true richness of the world around us."

**Revised Excerpt Example (Museum Example):**

*   **Original:** "The experience I had was one similar to the situation of Cárdenas experiencing the Grand Canyon for the first time – I appreciated everything I saw (relatively) free of expectation and the experience was much better for it. In subsequent visits to the museum, I expected the same level of enjoyment as my first trip and have been disappointed when it doesn't live up to my expectations – those which were created from my first visit."
*   **Revised:** "My initial visit to the Natural History Museum resonated with Cárdenas's experience, offering a perspective untainted by prior knowledge. However, subsequent visits were markedly different. Knowing the layout, exhibits, and even anticipating certain details, the sense of wonder was diminished. The initial excitement had transformed into a comparison against my idealized first impression, leading to a sense of disappointment. This illustrates how the very act of 'knowing' an experience can diminish its capacity to surprise and delight, solidifying Percy's claim that familiarity can breed a loss of genuine appreciation."

**In summary:** This is a strong paper that demonstrates a solid understanding of Percy's ideas. By adding more critical analysis, strengthening the connection between personal experiences and academic arguments, and refining the tone and language, the paper could be elevated to an even higher level.
