Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the essay, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

The essay presents an interesting argument about the "myth of autonomy" in Western society and explores how Daniel Defoe's *Robinson Crusoe* both supports and challenges this idea.  It demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and engages with relevant concepts like capitalism, asceticism, and the tension between self-reliance and faith.  However, the essay could benefit from sharper focus, more in-depth analysis, and clearer connections between its points.

**Strengths**

*   **Interesting Thesis:** The central claim about the myth of autonomy and its connection to *Robinson Crusoe* is thought-provoking and provides a good starting point for analysis.
*   **Engagement with the Text:** The essay uses specific examples from *Robinson Crusoe* to support its claims, demonstrating a close reading of the novel.
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** The essay engages with complex concepts like capitalism, asceticism, and the conflict between pride and humility.
*   **Clear Structure:** The essay has a generally clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Thesis Refinement:** While interesting, the thesis could be more precise. What *specifically* makes autonomy a myth? What *specific* aspects of *Crusoe* contribute to or challenge this myth?
*   **Depth of Analysis:**  The analysis often feels somewhat superficial.  It identifies conflicts and connections but doesn't always explore them in sufficient depth. For example, the connection between capitalism and asceticism is mentioned but not fully unpacked.
*   **Specificity of Claims:** Some claims are too broad or lack sufficient support. For instance, the assertion that Crusoe's success contributes to the myth of autonomy needs more explanation. Why would people *believe* in autonomy more because of Crusoe's story?  What specific *details* would inspire them?
*   **Connecting Points:**  The transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the connections between ideas could be made more explicit.  The essay sometimes jumps between points without fully explaining how they relate to each other.
*   **Nuance:** The essay could benefit from more nuance and consideration of counterarguments. Are there aspects of *Crusoe* that *do* support the possibility of autonomy? Are there other factors besides trade that undermine the myth?

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Refine the Thesis:**

    *   Instead of simply stating that autonomy is a myth, specify *why* it's a myth and *what* aspects of *Crusoe* contribute to or challenge this view.
    *   Example: "While *Robinson Crusoe* initially appears to celebrate the possibility of individual autonomy, a closer examination reveals that Crusoe's success depends on factors beyond pure self-reliance, ultimately reinforcing the myth that complete independence is attainable in Western society."

2.  **Develop the Analysis:**

    *   **Dig Deeper:** For each point you make, ask yourself "Why?" and "How?"  Don't just identify connections; explain them in detail.
    *   **Capitalism and Asceticism:**  Elaborate on the relationship between capitalism and asceticism. Explain how Crusoe's hard work and self-denial relate to the accumulation of wealth.
    *   **Pride and Humility:** Analyze the significance of Crusoe's lack of humility. How does this challenge traditional religious values?
    *   **Self-Reliance vs. Gratitude:** Explore the tension between Crusoe's self-reliance and his expressions of gratitude to God. Is he truly self-reliant, or does he acknowledge a higher power?

3.  **Strengthen Claims:**

    *   **Provide Evidence:** Back up your claims with more specific examples from the text.
    *   **Explain Connections:** Clearly explain how the evidence supports your claims. Don't assume that the reader will make the connection automatically.
    *   **Avoid Generalizations:** Avoid making broad statements about Western society or people's beliefs without providing evidence or qualification.

4.  **Improve Transitions and Connections:**

    *   **Use Transition Words:** Use transition words and phrases to signal the relationship between ideas (e.g., "however," "therefore," "in addition," "similarly").
    *   **Topic Sentences:** Make sure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that introduces the main point.
    *   **Connect Back to the Thesis:** Remind the reader how each paragraph relates to the overall argument.

5.  **Consider Nuance and Counterarguments:**

    *   **Acknowledge Complexity:** Recognize that the relationship between autonomy and *Crusoe* is not simple. Acknowledge aspects of the novel that might challenge your thesis.
    *   **Address Counterarguments:** Consider potential objections to your argument and respond to them.

6.  **Specific Edits:**

    *   **Clarity:** In the introduction, clarify what you mean by "autonomy." It would be a good idea to include a definition, or specify different kinds of autonomy (social, economic, spiritual).
    *   **"Myth of Autonomy was born:"** In the introduction, you say the myth of autonomy was born when it was realized that as long as there was a ruling body there was no chance to become wealthy. This is a complex and interesting claim but it needs further support and expansion.
    *   **Grammar/typos:** There are a few grammatical errors (e.g., "builds" in the third paragraph should be "built") and typos ("Crusoe" in the second paragraph). Proofread carefully.

**Example of Revision (Introduction):**

**Original:**

> In Western society (specifically in the United States) there has existed an idea since the colonial days that any individual, despite their class in the motherland, can achieve wealth and prosperity through hard work and determination alone. This idea has been commonly referred to throughout history as the myth of autonomy, because so many have tried it and failed.

**Revised:**

> Since the colonial era, Western society, particularly the United States, has embraced the idea that individuals can achieve prosperity and wealth solely through hard work and determination, regardless of their social origins. However, this widely held belief in *economic autonomy*—the ability to control one's financial destiny independent of external constraints—is largely a myth.

**In Summary**

The essay demonstrates promise, but it needs more depth, specificity, and clarity to fully develop its argument. By refining the thesis, strengthening the analysis, and connecting ideas more explicitly, you can create a more persuasive and insightful essay.
