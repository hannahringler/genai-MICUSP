    *   **Relevant Literature Review:** The literature review demonstrates an understanding of the existing scholarship on electoral systems, political parties, and democratization.
    *   **Empirical Data:** The inclusion of data from Indonesian elections strengthens the analysis and provides evidence to support the claims.

*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper presents relevant data, it could benefit from a deeper analysis of the causal mechanisms at play.
    *   **Counterarguments:** While the paper mentions Duverger's law, it could engage with counterarguments to the main thesis in greater detail.

**Specific Feedback Points**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   The introduction provides sufficient background information on the political context of Indonesia.
    *   The thesis statement in the form of a question is effective for framing the research.

*   **Literature Review:**
    *   The discussion of Duverger's law is a good way to introduce alternative perspectives. However, you could spend more time explaining the institutional factors behind political party development.
    *   The paper successfully incorporates scholarly sources.

*   **Research Design and Method:**
    *   The approach to analyzing elections over several decades is a valid method for examining the impact of the Electoral Commission.
    *   The hypothesis regarding the expansion of political parties is clearly stated.

*   **Data Analysis:**
    *   Table 1 is useful for presenting the election results.
    *   The analysis of the data supports the hypothesis that the establishment of the Independent Election Commission led to a greater number of political parties.
    *   The explanation of the failure of the Independent Electoral Commission to help ethnic Chinese secure seats helps provide context to the paper.

    *   The conclusion could be more assertive in summarizing the main findings and their implications.
    *   It would be helpful to highlight the key takeaway message of the paper in a more concise and impactful way.

**Recommendations for Revision**

1.  **Strengthen Causal Analysis:** Go beyond simply showing correlation and explain *why* the Independent Election Commission had the effects you describe. What specific mechanisms were at play? How did the new rules and procedures change the incentives and behavior of political actors?

2.  **Engage with Counterarguments:** Consider other possible explanations for the increase in political parties or the limitations on minority representation. Could there have been other societal or economic factors at play? Discuss these alternative explanations and explain why your interpretation is the most compelling.

3.  **Refine Conclusion:** Make the conclusion more succinct and impactful. Summarize the main findings in a clear and direct way, and highlight the most important implications of your research.

4.  **Look into other institutional factors:** While the existence of the independent body helps with the legitimacy of results, the paper could be enhanced by considering other factors involved in political party development.

5.  **More specific examples:** While the general explanation of the electoral college in the paper is useful, more specific examples of manipulation within it could help the argument.
