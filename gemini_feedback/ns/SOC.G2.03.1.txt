Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

This is a strong and well-structured essay that demonstrates a solid understanding of the theoretical concepts discussed. The writing is clear and generally well-organized.  The paper successfully addresses the prompt by comparing and contrasting the perspectives of Polanyi, Marshall, and Somers with those of utilitarians/liberals on the market, state, and civil society.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis and Structure:** The essay has a clear thesis statement in the introduction and maintains a logical structure throughout. The organization by theorist is effective for comparison.
*   **Understanding of Key Concepts:** The paper accurately defines and explains key concepts like liberalism, utilitarianism, self-regulating markets, civil society, and citizenship rights.
*   **Effective Use of Evidence:** The essay effectively uses quotes and references to support its claims and demonstrates familiarity with the primary texts.
*   **Comparison and Contrast:** The essay excels at comparing and contrasting the different theoretical perspectives.
*   **Well-Written and Articulate:** The writing style is clear, concise, and professional.
*   **Addresses the Prompt directly:** The paper directly and adequately address the points the prompts requested.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Deeper Analysis/Critical Engagement:** While the paper does a good job of summarizing and comparing the theorists, it could benefit from a deeper critical engagement with their ideas. Consider exploring the limitations of each perspective or offering your own insights.
*   **Synthesis and Connecting Themes:** While the paper effectively presents each theorist individually, consider adding more explicit connections and syntheses between their ideas. Are there overarching themes or debates that emerge when you consider all three together?
*   **Elaborate transitions:** There are a couple parts when the paper transitions between theorists or ideas that could be more clear with better wording or introductory statements.
*   **Clarify Polanyi's Stance:** You mentioned that Polanyi dislikes the free market, but later say that he doesn't advocate getting rid of the market. This difference should be elaborated on and more clear.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Consider adding a sentence or two at the end of the introduction that previews the main points of comparison and contrast you will be making.
    *   Briefly define "civil society" in the introduction, as it's a key concept throughout the essay.
*   **Utilitarian and Liberal Tradition:**
    *   This section is a good starting point, but it could be more concise. Focus on the key tenets that are most relevant to the later comparison with Polanyi, Marshall, and Somers.
    *   Instead of using footnotes to explain things like "dogs and goats", it would be more professional and clear to elaborate these points in the essay itself, and include them as direct quotes rather than summaries.
*   **Karl Polanyi:**
    *   Expand on Polanyi's concept of "fictitious commodities." Why are land and labor not meant to be sold on the market? What are the consequences of treating them as such?
    *   You mention that Polanyi believes that markets are not "natural." Make it clear why Polanyi believes this.
*   **T.H. Marshall:**
    *   In what ways are civil rights "beneficial to the wealthy?" Be more specific and provide examples. This claim might be debatable and could be further explored.
    *   Elaborate Marshall's ideas more clearly. He has 3 types of rights. In what other ways are they different?
*   **Margaret Somers:**
    *   Explain more fully why Somers disagrees with Marshall's ideas, and how it makes an important difference.
    *   Further elaborate "participatory association." Why is that important?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   The paper lacks a strong conclusion. Summarize the main points of comparison and contrast you have made. What are the key takeaways from comparing these different perspectives on the market, state, and civil society?
    *   Consider adding a final thought about the implications of these different perspectives for understanding contemporary social and economic issues.
*   **Consider your personal opinion:** The essay mainly explains the ideas and opinions of the different theorists. It would benefit the paper to know what you personally think.
*   **Typos:** There are a couple small grammatical errors. Review the paper before sending it in.

**Example Revisions**

*   **Instead of:**  "Some utilitarians, such as Hobbes, believed that there was no such thing as a civil society since everyone was out for themselves. "Society" was just an aggregate of people."

*   **Try:**  Some utilitarians went as far to say that civil society was not a real thing. As Thomas Hobbes claims, civil society is not real because, "everyone was out for themselves."
    *This makes it more clear what Hobbes believed and why.
*   **Instead of:** "Polanyi notes on pp. 154 that sometimes even economic liberals sought protectionism."
*   **Try:** While Polanyi's idea of a "double movement" highlights that those on the right of society and those who want protectionism are usually at odds, he acknowledges that there were sometimes even those on the right (economic liberals), who sought protectionism.

**In Summary**

This is a well-researched and thoughtfully written essay. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can elevate the analysis and make an even stronger impression. Good luck!
