Okay, here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of this paper, along with suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a clear argument for mandatory college-level writing courses. It effectively engages with the ideas presented in Mike Rose's article and offers a personal perspective on the issue. The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and a willingness to challenge established viewpoints. However, the paper could benefit from more nuanced argumentation and stronger support for its claims.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:** The central thesis is clearly stated and consistently maintained throughout the paper: college writing courses should be mandatory.
*   **Engagement with the Text:** The paper directly engages with Mike Rose's "The Language of Exclusion," referencing specific points and challenging his arguments.
*   **Personal Perspective:** The inclusion of personal experience adds a relatable and compelling dimension to the argument. The student's reflections on their own education and their children's schooling provide concrete examples to support their claims.
*   **Strong Stance:** The writer demonstrates confidence in their position and isn't afraid to disagree with established viewpoints.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper generally follows a logical progression, presenting its main points in a coherent manner.
*   **Proper Citation:** Citations are used correctly.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Oversimplification of Rose's Argument:** While the paper engages with Rose's article, it sometimes oversimplifies his points. For example, the paper criticizes Rose's discussion of "skill," but doesn't fully explore the complexities of Rose's argument regarding the social and political implications of defining writing as a purely technical skill.
*   **Lack of Nuance:** The argument can sometimes feel a bit binary (writing is *either* technical *or* intellectual). A more nuanced approach would acknowledge the interplay between technical skill and intellectual development in writing.
*   **Limited Evidence Beyond Personal Experience:** While personal experience is valuable, the paper relies heavily on it. Strengthening the argument would involve incorporating additional evidence, such as research on the impact of writing instruction on student success, statistics on writing proficiency among college students, or examples of successful writing programs.
*   **Inconsistent Tone:** The tone can shift between academic and conversational. While a personal voice is appreciated, maintaining a consistent and professional tone is important for academic writing.
*   **Some Generalizations:** The paper makes some broad generalizations about secondary education ("very little writing instruction") and the "academy." These statements could be qualified or supported with evidence.
*   **Repetitive Language:** There are places where the same points are repeated using similar phrasing. Editing for conciseness and variety would improve the flow of the paper.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Deepen Engagement with Rose:**
    *   Provide more context for Rose's argument. What are the broader social and political concerns that motivate his analysis of writing instruction?
    *   Acknowledge the nuances in Rose's position. Does he completely dismiss the importance of technical skills? Or is he primarily concerned with the potential for these skills to be devalued in relation to intellectual development?

2.  **Strengthen the Argument with Evidence:**
    *   **Research:** Find studies that demonstrate the positive impact of writing instruction on student success in college and beyond. Look for statistics on writing proficiency among college students.
    *   **Examples of Programs:** Highlight successful writing programs or initiatives at other universities. What are their key features? How have they benefited students?
    *   **Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments. For example, some might argue that mandatory writing courses are an unnecessary burden on students or that they are not effective.

3.  **Refine the Definition of "Skill":**
    *   Acknowledge the technical aspects of writing.
    *   Emphasize the ways in which writing involves critical thinking, analysis, and creativity.

4.  **Improve Tone and Style:**
    *   Strive for a more consistent and academic tone throughout the paper.
    *   Avoid overly casual or colloquial language.
    *   Vary sentence structure and vocabulary to avoid repetition.

5.  **Qualify Generalizations:**
    *   Instead of stating that "very little writing instruction" occurs in secondary schools, provide specific examples of the types of instruction that are lacking or the areas in which students are underprepared.
    *   Avoid generalizations about the "academy." Instead, focus on specific arguments or policies that you are challenging.

6.  **Editing and Proofreading:**
    *   Carefully proofread the paper for grammatical errors, typos, and awkward phrasing.
    *   Ensure that all citations are accurate and consistent.

**Example of How to Revise a Specific Section:**

**Original:**

> I believe that writing is a skill and I do not agree that labeling it as such should be considered "the kiss of death." It is common knowledge that universities and colleges teach principles and theories, but in most classroom situations, in order for students to convey to their professors and GSIs that they have grasped the principles and theories that they have been taught, they are required to utilize their skill of writing while taking exams and/or writing papers and they are expected to utilize it well.

**Revised:**

> While some may view the designation of writing as a "skill" as a limiting label, I argue that it is essential for academic success. Universities impart complex principles and theories, but students must demonstrate their understanding through written assignments and exams. Effective writing, therefore, becomes the primary means by which students communicate their mastery of the subject matter to professors and graduate student instructors.

**In Summary:**

This is a promising paper with a clear argument and a strong voice. By incorporating additional evidence, refining the analysis, and paying close attention to tone and style, the paper can be elevated to a higher level of academic writing. Good luck with your revisions!
