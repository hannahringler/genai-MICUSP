Here's some feedback on the paper, broken down into strengths, areas for improvement, and some specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles an interesting and important topic: the gendered nature of sports literacy and rhetoric and its impact on women's access to power and capital in the realm of sports. It's clear the author has put a significant amount of thought and research into the subject. The theoretical framework is relatively sophisticated, drawing on concepts like cultural capital, technologies of the self, and the sport-media-commercial complex.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis & Purpose:** The paper clearly defines the core argument: that sports literacy and rhetoric function as a masculinized domain that limits women's access to economic and cultural capital, despite increased participation.
*   **Solid Theoretical Framework:** The use of Bourdieu, Foucault, Messner, and others provides a strong foundation for analysis.
*   **Compelling Examples:** The use of specific examples (Keith Hernandez, WNBA coverage, sports magazine lists, Title IX debates) makes the argument more concrete and relatable.
*   **Critical Analysis:** The paper moves beyond simply describing the situation to critically examining the structures and ideologies that perpetuate the gendered divide in sports.
*   **Clear Definitions (Sports Rhetoric and Literacy):** The explicit attempt to define "sports rhetoric" and "sports literacy" is a strength, as these are not commonly used terms.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Organization and Flow:** At times, the paper can feel somewhat disjointed. The argument isn't always presented in the most logical or accessible order. Connecting the various theoretical concepts and examples more explicitly would improve clarity.
*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While the paper generally argues for a strong male/female dichotomy, acknowledging more of the nuances and complexities within each group would strengthen the argument. (e.g., the author touches on homosexual men's experience, but more could be said).
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Some sentences and paragraphs are overly complex and could be rephrased for greater clarity. Avoid jargon when possible.
*   **Elaborating on Title IX:** The section on Title IX could be more fleshed out. While it's mentioned that Title IX has not completely eliminated the inequities, further examination of the complexities and impacts, while also considering limitations would be beneficial.
*   **Specificity of Solutions:** The conclusion calls for challenging the sport-media-commercial complex. While this is a worthy goal, more concrete and actionable suggestions for achieving this would be beneficial.

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Thesis Statement Refinement:** While the thesis is good, consider refining it for even greater precision. For instance, you could add a brief mention of how the sport-media-commercial complex maintains this imbalance.
2.  **Strengthen Transitions:** Use more explicit transition words and phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs and sections. *E.g., "Building on Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital..." "In contrast to the intended effects of Title IX..."*
3.  **Address Counterarguments More Directly:** Consider including a brief section that acknowledges potential counterarguments or limitations to the central claim. For example, discuss ways in which women are successful within the sport structure.
4.  **"Sports Rhetoric" and "Literacy" Sections:** Consider placing the definitions of these terms higher up in the paper, making them easier for readers to access early in the reading of the text.
5.  **Conclusion - Actionable Steps:** Expand the conclusion to include more specific steps or suggestions for disrupting the power dynamics in sports. This could include recommendations for media representation, policy changes, or grassroots activism.
6.  **Citation Consistency:** Double-check all citations to ensure consistent formatting according to your chosen style.

**Minor Edits/Suggestions:**

*   "the male center of sports visible": Consider rephrasing this for clarity (e.g., "the male dominance in sports is highly visible").
*   "sports, then, can be a hugely important economic project": Change "can be" to "is." This adds greater conviction.
*   "the qualities which are rarely associated with female athletes are conflated with those qualities that create the contemporary ideal worker/citizen": This could be more specific. What qualities are rarely associated with female athletes? What aspects of the "ideal worker/citizen" are you referring to? Give an example.

**Revised Introduction Example**

"In the United States, sports are not simply a pastime; they are a powerful cultural and economic force, deeply intertwined with notions of success and leadership. However, this arena is not equally accessible to all. This paper argues that sports literacy and rhetoric, as they are currently constructed and promoted, function as a masculinized domain that significantly limits women's access to the economic and cultural capital associated with sports, despite increased female participation. This imbalance is perpetuated by the 'sport-media-commercial complex,' which reinforces masculine ideals and marginalizes women's contributions. By drawing on the theoretical frameworks of Bourdieu, Foucault, and Messner, this paper will examine how this gendered literacy operates, the impact of Title IX legislation, and potential avenues for challenging the existing power structures in the world of sports."

By addressing these suggestions, the paper can become even more impactful and convincing. Good luck!
