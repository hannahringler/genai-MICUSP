Here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on its strengths and areas for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents a well-structured and logical proposal for a research study. The research question is interesting and relevant, and the methodology, while straightforward, appears appropriate for addressing the hypothesis.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Focused Research Question:** The paper clearly states the research question (whether infant sleep patterns predict insomnia in college students) and hypothesis.
*   **Literature Review:** The literature review is comprehensive, covering infant sleep behaviors, insomnia, and sleep quality measurement. The sources cited appear relevant and authoritative.
*   **Methodology:** The chosen methodology (correlational study using surveys) is appropriate for the research question. The sample size (75 students and at least 50 caregivers) seems reasonable.
*   **Data Analysis Plan:** The data analysis plan is clearly outlined, including the use of a correlation test.
*   **Well Organized:** The paper is well-organized, following a logical flow from introduction to methods and data analysis.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The proposal addresses ethical considerations, such as informed consent and the option for participants to withdraw.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Specificity of Caregiver Survey Questions:** Some of the examples of caregiver survey questions could be refined to be more specific and measurable. For example:
    *   Instead of "How often did you put your infant to bed at a different time each night?", consider "On average, how much did your infant's bedtime vary from day to day? (0-15 minutes, 15-30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, more than 60 minutes)."
*   **Socio-economic Status:** While it's acknowledged the population will most likely be middle to upper class, is there a plan to collect basic information on socio-economic status? This would provide additional data that could be analyzed.
*   **Justification for using a Retrospetive Design:** While the research proposal acknowledges that the research is retrospective and discusses its difference in this study, it doesn't provide a justification. Why is this the design used? What are the potential benefits?

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction and Literature Review:** Consider adding a section specifically discussing the link between early childhood experiences (including sleep patterns) and later life outcomes, to strengthen the rationale for your research question.
*   **Participants:** In the "Participants" section, mention any exclusion criteria (e.g., students with diagnosed sleep disorders or significant medical conditions that could affect sleep).
*   **Materials/Procedures:**
    *   Provide more detail about the process of matching the student and caregiver surveys.
    *   Clarify how the caregiver survey will be administered (mail, online, etc.).
*   **Data Analysis Plan:** Justify the choice of the correlation test. Mention which specific type of correlation coefficient you will use (e.g., Pearson's r, Spearman's rho).
*   **Anticipated Challenges/Limitations:** Add a section discussing potential challenges or limitations of the study (e.g., recall bias in the caregiver survey, difficulty recruiting caregivers, limited generalizability).

By addressing these points, the paper will present an even stronger and more compelling research proposal.
