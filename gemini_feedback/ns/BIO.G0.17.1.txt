Here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths and areas for improvement.  I'll break it down into categories.

**Overall Impressions:**

*   The paper tackles an interesting question in nutritional physiology and its effects on organ systems. The central hypothesis related to resource allocation in the face of protein deficiency is well-motivated.
*   The experimental design is relatively straightforward.
*   The results are clearly presented, with appropriate statistical analysis and figures.
*   The discussion ties the findings to existing literature, although this is an area with significant room for expansion and deeper analysis.

**Specific Feedback Areas:**

**1. Abstract:**

*   **Strengths:** Clearly summarizes the research question, methods, key findings, and a concluding interpretation.
*   **Suggestions:** The abstract is descriptive, but could benefit from being more impactful. Consider highlighting the broader implications or significance of the findings more explicitly.

**2. Introduction:**

*   **Strengths:** Provides good background on the general topic of dietary adaptation in organisms. The rationale for focusing on the heart, pancreas, and testes is clearly explained. The initial hypotheses are well-defined.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   **Expand the Literature Review:** While it sets the stage, it needs more specific citations related to:
        *   Organ-specific responses to nutrient deficiency in mammals (especially mice). What is *already known* about these specific organs' reaction to protein stress?
        *   Resource allocation trade-offs in reproduction vs. survival under stress. Give specific examples.
    *   **Sharpen the Hypothesis:** The hypothesis for each organ should be stated very explicitly and concisely near the end of the introduction. Make it clear what you *predict* for each organ based on your understanding of the literature.

**3. Methods and Materials:**

*   **Strengths:** Reasonably clear, with enough detail to understand the experimental procedure.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   **More Detail is Needed:**
        *   **Mice:** Strain, age, and source of the mice used.
        *   **Diet:** Precise composition of the standard and protein-deficient chow.  Including % protein, % carbohydrates, % fat.
        *   **Statistical Analysis:** Specify *which* t-test was used (e.g., independent samples t-test, paired t-test). Mention how data met assumptions for use of t-test.
        *   **Immunoblot analysis:** Provide greater detail. Antibody sources and dilutions, blocking conditions, developing reagents.
    *   **Clarity:** The sentence "Measures of the body mass of the mice were taken before the harvesting of tissue and measures of the organ weight were taken prior to tissue homogenization to give the organ wt/ body wt ratios" can be clearer; specifically how organ weight was determined.

**4. Results:**

*   **Strengths:** Well-organized, with clear presentation of statistical results (p-values). The use of figures and tables is appropriate.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   **Effect Sizes:** While p-values are important, include effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d) to indicate the magnitude of the observed differences.
    *   **Clarity on Figures:** Figure captions should be more informative. The axes and units are good, but briefly describe what each figure demonstrates.

**5. Discussion:**

*   **Strengths:** Attempts to connect the findings to the broader literature on nutritional stress and reproduction. Addresses potential limitations.
*   **Suggestions:** *This is the area needing the most work.*
    *   **Deeper Integration of Literature:** Instead of simply listing studies, *compare and contrast* your findings with those reported in the literature.  Where do your findings agree?  Where do they disagree?  Why might those differences exist?
    *   **Mechanistic Explanations:** Go beyond descriptive statements. What are the *mechanisms* that might explain the observed results?
        *   For example, if the pancreas decreases in size/protein content, are there specific signaling pathways or protein degradation pathways that are likely involved? Cite relevant literature on these pathways.
        *   Why was testes size maintained? Explore the roles of specific hormones or protective mechanisms.
    *   **Limitations:** Expand the discussion of limitations. The small sample size is a critical one. Consider other potential limitations, such as:
        *   The relatively short duration of the protein deficiency.
        *   The possibility of compensatory mechanisms that might take longer to develop.
        *   The fact that it is only 3 organs that were studied
    *   **Future Directions:** What future experiments could be done to further investigate these findings? Consider:
        *   Investigating specific protein synthesis or degradation pathways.
        *   Examining hormonal changes.
        *   Longer-term studies of protein deficiency.

**6. Figures and Tables:**

*   **Strengths:** Generally well-presented.
*   **Suggestions:** Improve figure legends (as noted above).

**Specific Line Edits and Comments:**

*   **Abstract:** "vital life functions." Vague. Which functions specifically?
*   **Introduction:** "Organisms are constantly altering their diets in response to food ability..." should be "Organisms are constantly altering their diets in response to food *availability*..."
*   **Introduction:** "...of mice will be maintained when faced with protein deficiency, since in nature mice have a rapid turnover rate and the success of the future generations may take priority over individual success."  Clarify this connection.  Why does a rapid turnover rate imply prioritizing future generations?
*   **Methods:** "to give the organ wt/ body wt ratios" sounds awkward. Consider "to calculate organ weight to body weight ratios."
*   **Results:** When presenting numbers, be consistent with the number of significant digits.
*   **Discussion:** Avoid stating "extremely large due to the small sample size and having a larger sample size may have yielded significant differences". Instead, mention "due to small sample size".
*   **Formatting:** Double check your formatting for consistent use of italics, capitalization, etc.

**Overall:**

This is a solid starting point. The experiments seem well-executed, and the results are clear. The key is to expand the discussion section, providing a more nuanced and mechanistic interpretation of the findings by deeply engaging with the relevant scientific literature. I hope this is helpful!
