Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper is well-organized, thoughtful, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges and nuances of using integrated assessments to address messy environmental problems. The writing is generally clear and professional.  It effectively uses examples to illustrate key points. The paper's focus on the practical challenges of *implementing* integrated assessments, rather than just the theory, is a real strength.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis/Argument:** The introduction clearly states the purpose of the paper and the core argument: Integrated assessments are valuable but challenging and require careful consideration of adequacy, value, legitimacy, and effectiveness.
*   **Strong Organization:** The structure is logical and easy to follow, with each section dedicated to a specific criterion (adequacy, value, legitimacy, effectiveness).
*   **Use of Examples:** The paper effectively uses the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia, global warming, and Cod Fishery cases to illustrate the points being made. The examples make the abstract concepts more concrete and relatable.
*   **Critical Analysis:** The paper doesn't simply present the criteria for integrated assessments; it critically analyzes the challenges in meeting them and points out the potential pitfalls.
*   **Nuanced Understanding:** The paper avoids simplistic pronouncements and acknowledges the complexities involved in environmental decision-making.  It recognizes that even good science can be perceived as inadequate and that uncertainty is often unavoidable.
*   **Practical Focus:** The paper emphasizes practical considerations, such as the need to address stakeholders' perceptions of science and the importance of cross-sector partnerships.
*   **Professional Tone:** The writing is clear, concise, and appropriate for an academic audience.

**Weaknesses & Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Specificity of Examples:**

    *   While the examples are good, sometimes more specific details would strengthen the arguments. For example, in the Cod Fishery case, briefly mentioning specific actions the government took that favored the fishing industry would make the point more impactful.  Similarly, with global warming, specifying which RISA outputs were relevant to both science and policy can clarify the intent of RISAs.
*   **Elaboration on Solutions:**

    *   While the paper effectively identifies problems, it could benefit from more elaboration on potential solutions. For example, in the "Adequacy" section, the paper highlights the problem of stakeholders viewing science through "myths."  Could you suggest strategies for addressing these myths, perhaps through improved communication or stakeholder engagement? This could be things like education.
    *   In the Legitimacy section, after stating the need for cross-sector partnerships, could you suggest some concrete steps the assessment process could take to encourage collaborative partnerships?
*   **Clarity of Connections:**

    *   Sometimes, the connection between the general point and the specific example could be made more explicit. For instance, after introducing Sarrewitz's Five Myths of Science, the paper could directly state *how* stakeholders' views aligned with each myth.
*   **Depth of Analysis:**

    *   While the paper covers a lot of ground, it could delve deeper into the underlying causes of the problems it identifies. For example, why are governments often reactive rather than proactive? Are there systemic factors that contribute to this?
*   **Concluding Remarks:**

    *   The conclusion is a bit repetitive of the introduction. It could be strengthened by:
        *   Briefly summarizing the main challenges identified in each section (adequacy, value, legitimacy, effectiveness).
        *   Offering a more forward-looking perspective. What are the key takeaways for decision-makers commissioning an integrated assessment? What are the most important factors to consider to increase the likelihood of success?

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Adequacy:**  When discussing Sarrewitz's myths, briefly describe one or two of those myths (perhaps directly quoting him) to make the point clearer.  Also, consider adding a sentence about how science communicators might address these myths.
*   **Value:** Elaborate on the challenges governments face in being proactive, even with salient scientific information. Are there political, economic, or social pressures that contribute to this?  The point about Scheffer's ecological complexities is important; consider adding a brief explanation of what those complexities are for readers who may not be familiar with his work.
*   **Legitimacy:** Provide a specific example of a decision made by the FRCC that favored the fishing industry, and highlight the impact of that decision on other stakeholders.
*   **Effectiveness:**  Suggest some concrete strategies for moving beyond "marginal victories." Could adaptive management approaches be helpful?  How can integrated assessments be designed to promote more significant policy changes?

**Minor Edits/Proofreading**

*   "especially as inherently authoritative" - Consider rephrasing. Perhaps "especially when viewed as inherently authoritative".
*   "is essentially makes decisions" - Should be "essentially makes decisions" or "essentially makes *the* decisions".
*   "before you being to address" - Should be "before you begin to address".

**In Summary**

This is a very good paper that demonstrates a solid understanding of integrated assessments and the challenges they pose. By adding more specific details, elaborating on potential solutions, and deepening the analysis, you can further strengthen the paper and make it even more impactful. Good job!
