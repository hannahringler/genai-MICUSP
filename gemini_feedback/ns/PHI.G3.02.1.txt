Okay, I can provide feedback on this philosophy paper. To give you the most helpful feedback, I'll break it down into several areas:

**Overall Impressions:**

*   **Originality and Argument:** The central idea of a "self-imperative" account of qualia is interesting and potentially original. It offers a way to bridge the gap between intentional content and behavior in a way that traditional representationalism struggles with. This strength is a great starting point for further development.
*   **Clarity and Structure:** Generally well-structured. The introduction clearly lays out the problem, the proposed solution, and the plan for the paper. The headings make it easy to follow the argument. There are some sections that may need further development or additional clarification.
*   **Engagement with Existing Literature:** Demonstrates a good awareness of the debates around qualia, functionalism, and intentionalism. However, there's room to strengthen this by explicitly referencing and engaging with specific arguments/authors who have addressed similar concerns (and especially those that address concerns from a behavioral perspective).

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Statement:** The paper clearly identifies the Problem of Function and the Problem of Explanation as key challenges for traditional representationalism. This sets the stage for a well-motivated alternative.
*   **Compelling Examples:** The examples of Francis (enjoying pain) and the contrasting musical preferences (Jason and Sonia) are effective in highlighting the limitations of representationalism.
*   **Well-Defined Alternative:** The concept of "self-imperatives" is introduced and explained relatively clearly. The distinction between representational content and imperatives (direction of fit) is important.
*   **Addresses Potential Objections:** The paper attempts to anticipate and address potential objections to the self-imperative account, such as the possibility of mixed experiences (pleasant and painful).

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Developing the Self-Imperative Concept:**
    *   The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of what constitutes a "self-imperative." What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be a self-imperative of the relevant kind?
    *   Expand on the analogy to plant signals: While the idea of stripped-down imperatives is helpful, it also needs more clarification. How do these "proto-imperatives" in plants differ from the self-imperatives in conscious beings? What makes the latter *intentional* in a way that plant signals might not be?
    *   Clarify what kind of self-imperatives are involved. Are they beliefs, desires, or some other type of mental state?
    *   The paper states that pain is a self-imperative to avoid features while pleasure is to seek those features. Is there a way to avoid any features and seek every feature? If not, it may not be accurate.

*   **Addressing Counterarguments More Directly:**
    *   While the paper gestures at responses the traditional representationalist might offer, it could benefit from a more rigorous examination of these alternative viewpoints.
    *   Are there any known issues with this theory?

*   **Elaborating on the Relationship to Functionalism:**
    *   The paper claims that the self-imperative account is "functionally kosher," but it could elaborate on how this account integrates with the broader functionalist framework.
    *   Address how to solve the "Knowledge Argument" as an intentionalist.

*   **Expanding the Scope and Implications:**
    *   The concluding section suggests that self-imperative accounts could be extended to other qualia, such as emotions. This is an interesting suggestion that could be explored further.
    *   What are the broader implications of this account for our understanding of consciousness and the mind-body problem?

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Page 2:** More concisely define qualia.
*   **Page 3:** Define Representationalism, intentionalism and functionalism in the first paragraph.
*   **Page 5:** Describe a possible alternative view that someone has who enjoys pain.
*   **Page 6:** Clarify what is "explanatory."
*   **Page 7:** Further explain satisfaction of an imperative.
*   **Page 9:** Explain in more detail the example of when the eating is pleasant but the stomach ache is painful.
*   **Page 9:** Add a more specific definition of representation and qualia.
*   **Page 10:** Add more detail to the example about winning a chess game or listening to a song.
*   **Page 11:** Add in more detail what it means to be functionally kosher.

**Conclusion:**

This is a thoughtful and promising paper that offers a novel perspective on the problem of qualia. By further developing the concept of "self-imperatives," rigorously addressing potential objections, and elaborating on the broader implications of this account, the paper could be significantly strengthened. Remember to carefully cite and engage with the existing literature to situate your argument within the broader philosophical conversation. Good luck!
