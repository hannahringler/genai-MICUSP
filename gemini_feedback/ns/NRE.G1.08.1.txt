Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the paper, covering its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.  I'll focus on clarity, organization, argumentation, and style, drawing from common issues in student writing.  Since I don't have context on the specific assignment guidelines, I'll assume a general academic essay format.

**Overall Impression**

The paper provides a good overview of the different stakeholders and their positions on renewable fuels legislation. It identifies key players and presents their arguments. However, it could benefit from a stronger central argument, more in-depth analysis, and clearer organization.

**Strengths**

*   **Identifies key players:** The paper effectively identifies the major players involved in the debate (Ethanol/Renewable Fuels Society, Petroleum Industry, Environmental Groups, President, Livestock and Poultry Industry) and their stances.
*   **Presents diverse perspectives:** The paper makes an effort to present different sides of the issue, acknowledging the arguments made by each stakeholder.
*   **Relevant factual details:** The paper includes relevant data, such as the proposed increases in renewable fuel standards and campaign contributions.
*   **Clear writing style**: The writing is generally easy to understand.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Lack of a Clear Central Argument (Thesis):** The paper reads more like a descriptive overview than an argumentative essay. It lacks a clear thesis statement that articulates the *purpose* of the analysis. What specific point are you trying to make about the interaction of these stakeholders? What overall conclusion are you driving toward?
*   **Superficial Analysis:** The paper presents the positions of different groups but doesn't deeply analyze the *reasons* behind those positions or the *implications* of their stances. It needs more critical thinking and analysis.
*   **Organization and Flow:** While the paper covers the different players, the transitions between sections could be smoother. It sometimes feels like a collection of summaries rather than a cohesive argument. The "Action Channels" section feels a bit disconnected.
*   **Insufficient Evidence/Support:** While it mentions some data, more specific evidence and stronger source integration would enhance the arguments.
*   **Limited Critical Engagement:** The paper mainly presents information without much critical engagement. Where are the opportunities to evaluate the claims, evidence, and biases of the different stakeholders?
*   **Conclusion is Missing or Weak:** The essay does not have a formal conclusion.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Develop a Strong Thesis Statement:**

    *   **Identify the core question:** What is the central question you want to answer about this issue?  For example, "How do the conflicting economic and environmental interests of key stakeholders complicate the passage of effective renewable fuel legislation?"
    *   **Formulate your argument:** Based on your understanding of the issue, what is your answer to that question?  This becomes your thesis.  A strong thesis will make a claim that can be debated and supported with evidence.
    *   **Example Thesis:** "The debate over renewable fuel standards in the 110th Congress reveals how deeply entrenched economic interests, particularly those of the petroleum and agricultural industries, hinder the implementation of environmentally sound and effective energy policy."

2.  **Strengthen Analysis:**

    *   **Go beyond description:** Don't just summarize the positions of the stakeholders. Analyze *why* they hold those positions. What are their underlying motivations? What are the potential consequences of their actions?
    *   **Examine the power dynamics:** Analyze the power relationships between the different stakeholders. Who has the most influence? How do they exert that influence?
    *   **Identify biases and conflicts of interest:** Critically evaluate the claims made by each stakeholder. Are there any biases or conflicts of interest that might be influencing their arguments?  For example, you mention campaign contributions - explicitly link this to potential bias.

3.  **Improve Organization and Flow:**

    *   **Logical Structure:** The paper's current organization by stakeholder is okay, but consider whether a different structure might be more effective for making your argument. For example, you could organize by key issue (e.g., economic impacts, environmental concerns, energy security).
    *   **Clear Transitions:** Use transition words and phrases to connect ideas and paragraphs. Explain how each section relates to the overall argument.
    *   **Integrate "Action Channels":**  The "Action Channels" section could be better integrated by showing how each stakeholder *used* those channels (committees, lobbying, etc.) to advance their interests.

4.  **Enhance Evidence and Support:**

    *   **More Specific Examples:** Provide more specific examples to support your claims. For example, instead of just saying that the Petroleum Industry has "monetary resources," give specific examples of their lobbying efforts or campaign contributions.
    *   **Stronger Source Integration:** Directly quote or paraphrase from sources to support your points. Be sure to properly cite all sources.

5.  **Develop a Strong Conclusion:**

    *   **Restate your thesis:** Briefly restate your thesis in a new and insightful way.
    *   **Summarize key findings:** Briefly summarize the key findings of your analysis.
    *   **Offer a concluding thought:** End with a thought-provoking statement about the implications of your analysis. What are the broader implications of this debate? What are the potential consequences for the future of energy policy?

**Specific Line-by-Line Comments (Examples)**

*   "Energy has historically been a challenging issue in Congress." (Good opening line, but could be made more specific. For example, "Energy policy has long been a battleground in Congress, reflecting the diverse and often conflicting interests of various stakeholders.")
*   "The energy bills differ in numerous areas but a alteration in the current renewable transportation fuels mandate sits at the top."  (Grammar: "...but an alteration...")
*   "Although, pleased to pass energy legislation, there was disappointment with Democrats..." (Remove the comma after "Although")
*   "The bill will benefit our nations economy because ethanol can help stabilize commodity prices, provide competition, increase net farm income, boosts employment and improve the equilibrium of trade." (This is a claim that needs to be supported with evidence. Cite a source that makes this argument.)
*   "The Environmentalists, known to be strong lobbyists..." (Show, don't tell. Give specific examples of their lobbying efforts.)

**In Summary**

This paper has a good foundation, but needs strengthening of its central argument, deeper analysis, and improved organization to become a more compelling and persuasive essay. By focusing on these areas, you can elevate the paper from a descriptive overview to a critical analysis of the complex dynamics surrounding renewable fuel legislation.
