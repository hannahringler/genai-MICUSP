Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of Lukas's *Common Ground* and its narrative style. The student effectively summarizes key points and contrasts the experiences of the three families. However, as the student also notes, the paper leans heavily on summary and could benefit from deeper analysis.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Summary:** The paper provides a clear and concise summary of the key events and perspectives presented in the book.
*   **Strong Use of Quotes:** The inclusion of direct quotes from the book effectively illustrates the different viewpoints and the complexities of the issues.
*   **Understanding of Narrative Style:** The student recognizes and highlights Lukas's distinctive approach of using individual stories to explore broader historical themes.
*   **Identified Weakness:** The student is self-aware and accurately identifies the lack of deeper analysis as a weakness.
*   **Structure:** The paper is relatively well-organized, presenting the information in a logical sequence.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Analysis:** This is the primary weakness. The paper mostly describes *what* happened and *who* said it, but doesn't sufficiently delve into the *why*.
*   **Lack of Argument:** The paper is descriptive rather than argumentative. It lacks a central thesis statement or a clear argument about the book's strengths, weaknesses, or its relevance to education.
*   **Superficial Connections to Education:** The opening statement mentions the book is different from educational books but the connection to education is not explored very profoundly.
*   **Uneven Depth:** Some sections are more detailed than others. For example, the summary of the busing conflict could be expanded upon.
*   **Reliance on Book Summary:** The paper is too focused on retelling the book's story instead of discussing the bigger picture.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Develop a Thesis/Argument:** Introduce a clear thesis statement in the introduction. This statement should express your overall evaluation of the book, its significance, or its connection to educational themes. For example:

    *   "While Lukas's *Common Ground* effectively captures the human experience of desegregation in Boston through its intimate portrayal of three families, its lack of in-depth analysis limits its effectiveness as a comprehensive historical study of the educational challenges of the era."

2.  **Deepen the Analysis:** This is the most important area for improvement. Consider the following questions:

    *   *Why* did Lukas choose this particular narrative style? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
    *   *What* does *Common Ground* reveal about the complexities of desegregation and its impact on individuals and communities?
    *   *How* does the book challenge or reinforce existing understandings of race, class, and education?
    *   *What* are the limitations of focusing on only three families?
    *   *How* is the context of Boston important, and how does it compare to other places in the US?
    *   *How* is it relevant to education?

3.  **Strengthen Connections to Education:** Explicitly connect the events and themes of *Common Ground* to broader issues in education, such as:

    *   School integration and its challenges.
    *   The role of race and class in shaping educational opportunities.
    *   The impact of social and political events on students and teachers.
    *   The importance of understanding diverse perspectives in education.
    *   How a study like this can improve schools and the people in them.

4.  **Expand on Specific Examples:** Choose a few key events or characters and analyze them in greater depth. For instance, the conflict over busing offers a rich opportunity to explore the different perspectives and the emotional toll on students and families.

5.  **Consider Counterarguments:** Acknowledge alternative viewpoints or potential criticisms of Lukas's book. For example, you could discuss whether the focus on personal narratives overshadows broader systemic issues.

6.  **Refine the Conclusion:** The conclusion should reiterate your thesis and summarize your main points. It should also offer a final reflection on the book's significance or its implications for education.

**Example of incorporating analysis:**

Instead of just saying:

>   "Finally, Colin Diver underwent a fairly radical change in his outlook on race. From someone who seemed fairly oblivious to the issue, he and his wife purposefully looked for housing that would provide “the racial, ethnic, and class mix to be found only in the inner city."

Try something like:

>   "Colin Diver's eventual move towards seeking out a diverse community, while seemingly a positive development, also reveals a certain naiveté and perhaps a limited understanding of the systemic challenges faced by people of color. While he seeks "racial, ethnic, and class mix," the book suggests this is more of a lifestyle choice for him than a deep engagement with issues of inequality. This illustrates a potential pitfall of well-intentioned integration efforts: a focus on surface-level diversity without addressing the underlying power dynamics and historical injustices."

**In summary:**

Focus on adding your own voice and critical thinking to the paper. Move beyond summarizing the book and delve into analyzing its strengths, weaknesses, and broader implications. By doing so, you'll transform the paper from a descriptive summary into a thoughtful and insightful analysis.
