Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on your paper, covering strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a clear argument: that Sir William Thornhill in *The Vicar of Wakefield* is not as charitable or as good a friend as he appears or is portrayed to be.  You support this claim with textual evidence and reasoning.  The argument is consistent throughout the paper.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis is clearly stated in the introductory paragraph and provides a roadmap for the argument.
*   **Strong Topic Sentences:** Most paragraphs have clear topic sentences that connect directly to the thesis.
*   **Textual Evidence:** You use direct quotes from the novel to support your claims. You also clearly state what page number the quote is on.
*   **Logical Argumentation:** The arguments generally follow a logical flow, building upon each other. You raise reasonable objections to counter-arguments.
*   **Focused Analysis:** You stay focused on your central argument and don't stray into irrelevant tangents.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While you identify inconsistencies and questionable actions, some of your analysis could delve deeper. Instead of just stating that an action is unkind, try to explain *why* it's unkind and what the implications are. Explore the *motivations* behind Sir William's actions. Is it pride? Is it a misguided attempt to teach a lesson? Understanding the why helps to build a more compelling argument.
*   **Counterarguments:** While you do mention some counterarguments, they could be expanded upon more. Consider alternative interpretations of Sir William's behavior. For example, one might argue that he is simply trying to avoid interfering too much in the lives of others. Addressing and refuting these counterarguments will strengthen your own argument.
*   **Development of Ideas:** Some paragraphs feel a bit underdeveloped. Adding more explanation, context, or examples would enhance their impact.
*   **Clarity and Precision:** In a few places, the wording could be more precise and clear. This is particularly true where you're trying to convey complex ideas.
*   **Significance:** In the conclusion (or perhaps woven throughout the paper), address the *so what* question. Why is it important to challenge the perception of Sir William as a charitable figure? What does this reveal about the novel's themes, social commentary, or the nature of appearances?

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:** Briefly introduce Oliver Goldsmith and the novel. This will establish context for readers unfamiliar with the work.
*   **Quote Integration:** Smooth out the integration of some quotes. For example, rather than just stating "(136)," try to weave the quote into the sentence more naturally. Also, you can mention who is speaking the quote in the sentence.
*   **Paragraph 2:** Instead of saying that Sir William doesn't show "as many instances of charity one would expect", perhaps suggest what sort of charity might be expected of someone in his position. This creates a more specific expectation against which his actions can be measured.
*   **Paragraph 3:** When you say Sir William helps them in the field "to a degree makes up for his taking from them", explain how or why it "makes up" for his taking money from them.
*   **Paragraph 4:** When you say that Sir William should have notified the entire family of Mr Thornhill's character, consider what the effects of that would have been? What does he have to gain or lose from telling them?
*   **Paragraph 5:** Explain what those "chances at making good marriages" would have meant to the Primroses.
*   **Conclusion:** Expand on the conclusion to really drive home your points.

**Example of Improved Depth of Analysis:**

Instead of:

> This is not true. It was certainly not “out of his power to restrain” (149). He could have done any number of things to prevent this from happening.

Try:

> This justification rings hollow. It stretches credulity to suggest that Sir William, a man of wealth and influence, was truly powerless to intervene. He could have revealed his true identity, exposed Mr. Thornhill's past, or even threatened to disinherit his nephew. His inaction, therefore, speaks not of powerlessness, but of a deliberate choice to prioritize his own amusement or perhaps to teach the Primroses a harsh lesson.

**Revised Overall Structure Suggestion:**

1.  **Introduction:** Brief context about Goldsmith and *The Vicar of Wakefield*, thesis statement.
2.  **Sir William's Limited Charity:**  Focus on his lack of tangible charitable acts towards the Primroses, despite his reputation.
3.  **Sir William's Actions That Harm the Primroses:** Focus on the instances where Sir William takes from the Primroses.
4.  **Sir William's Inaction Regarding Olivia's Seduction:**  Argue that his failure to fully intervene is a betrayal of friendship and a failure of moral responsibility.
5.  **Sir William's Knowledge of His Nephew:** Argue that he knew about his nephew and did nothing to warn the family, and expand on some of the specific instances where you prove that Sir William knew the type of person his nephew was.
6.  **The Disconnect Between Words and Actions:** Emphasize the contrast between Sir William's pronouncements of virtue and his actual behavior.
7.  **Counterarguments and Rebuttals:** Address and refute potential objections to your interpretation.
8.  **Conclusion:**  Reiterate your thesis and discuss the broader implications of your analysis.

By addressing these areas for improvement and implementing the specific suggestions, you can elevate your paper to a higher level of analysis and argumentation. Good luck!
