Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-structured and ambitious proposal. It tackles a relevant and interesting research question related to intergroup conflict and how priming can influence perceptions. The literature review is solid and integrates key theoretical concepts effectively. The experimental design is detailed and demonstrates a good understanding of research methodology.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Research Question:** The paper clearly articulates the research question: Can priming a common outgroup alter intergroup attitudes? This focus helps guide the entire proposal.
*   **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** The proposal grounds its arguments in relevant theories such as Realistic Group Conflict Theory, Social Identity Theory, Symbolic Racism, and the "common enemy" effect. The connections between the theories and the research question are well-explained.
*   **Comprehensive Literature Review:** The literature review demonstrates a good grasp of existing research on intergroup relations, priming, and racial attitudes. The discussion of past research is used to justify the need for the proposed study.
*   **Detailed Experimental Design:** The description of the experimental design is thorough. You clearly outline the different conditions, primes, and measures. The multiple studies with varying primes adds robustness to the design.
*   **Testable Hypotheses:** The hypotheses are clearly stated, testable, and logically follow from the theoretical framework and literature review.
*   **Relevance and Significance:** The research question has clear relevance to understanding intergroup dynamics in contemporary society, particularly in the context of race and politics. The discussion of the potential for manipulating groups is interesting and insightful.
*   **Good Structure and Organization:** The paper is logically organized with clear headings and subheadings, making it easy to follow.
*   **Well-Written:** The writing is generally clear, concise, and academic in tone.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarify the Specific Primes:**
    *   While you mention "subtle" and "explicit" primes, providing more concrete examples of what these primes *specifically* involve would strengthen the proposal. For instance, what specific images will be included in the subtle and explicit white prime for Latinos and blacks? The current level of detail leaves some ambiguity. Be as concrete as possible.
    *   Ensure the primes are standardized. Will the subtle and explicit primes be uniform in length and visual quality? This aspect is very important in maintaining experimental control.

*   **Strengthen the Argument about the Common Enemy Manipulation:**
    *   While you discuss Sherif's "Robbers Cave" experiment, consider addressing his critiques of using a common enemy as a method for reducing conflict. Is it only a temporary solution? Does it simply shift the conflict to a new target?
    *   Explain why you believe that the benefits of using a common enemy manipulation will be long-lasting. This discussion will add a more nuanced perspective to the proposal.

*   **Address Potential Limitations:**
    *   Acknowledge potential limitations of the study. For example:
        *   **Ecological Validity:** Can the findings of an experiment generalize to real-world political behavior?
        *   **Sample Bias:** How will you ensure that your sample is representative of the populations you are studying?
        *   **Social Desirability Bias:** Are there potential issues of social desirability bias in participants' responses, especially when it comes to racial attitudes?
        *   **Oversimplification:** Are you potentially oversimplifying complex intergroup dynamics by focusing on only one outgroup at a time?
*   **Statistical Power:** Briefly address whether the sample size is large enough to detect meaningful effects.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **In the "Priming Group Identity and Conflict" section:**
    *   Expand on the normative implications of the research. How can the findings be used to promote more positive intergroup relations? Be specific.

*   **In the "Research Methods" Section:**
    *   Mention the number of subjects per condition.
    *   Describe the specific measures you will use to assess feelings of favorability, candidate support, group identification, and perceptions of threat.
    *   Include a brief mention of the statistical analyses you will use to test your hypotheses. (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests, regression analysis).

*   **Refine Hypothesis H8:**
    *   Consider reframing H8 to be more specific. What is the threshold where the explicit prime becomes necessary?

**Proofreading:**

*   Double-check the document for minor grammatical errors and typos.

**Overall:**

This is a strong and well-developed research proposal. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, you can further enhance its clarity, rigor, and potential impact. Good luck with your research!
