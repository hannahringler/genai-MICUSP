Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

This is a thought-provoking and well-argued essay. You've clearly done your research, and you present a compelling case that sexuality in ancient Greece was less about personal preference and more about social dynamics and power. The use of primary sources (Anacreon, Plato, Pindar, Aeschines) is strong, and you weave them into your argument effectively. The paper shows a sophisticated understanding of the nuances of historical interpretation.

**Strengths**

*   **Strong Thesis:** The thesis is clearly stated ("Sexuality of Ancient Greece as an instrument of social mobility") and consistently argued throughout the paper.
*   **Solid Evidence:** You provide concrete examples from ancient texts to support your claims. The references to Anacreon, Pelops, and Timarchos are well-chosen and analyzed.
*   **Nuanced Understanding:** You demonstrate an awareness of the complexities of interpreting ancient attitudes toward sexuality. You avoid simplistic or anachronistic interpretations.
*   **Clear Structure:** The essay is logically organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.
*   **Academic Tone:** The language and style are appropriate for an academic essay.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Deeper Contextualization**: While you do a good job presenting your argument, providing a bit more historical and cultural context could strengthen your claims.
    *   For example, even a brief mention of the social structure of ancient Greece and how power was distributed could help the reader understand the stakes involved in these "sexual choices."
*   **Counterarguments/Limitations:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments. While your argument is persuasive, some might argue that individual preferences *did* play a role, even if heavily influenced by social factors.
    *   Consider exploring how ancient Greek philosophical ideas of love and desire (e.g., Platonic love) might complicate the picture you're painting.
*   **Clarity of Some Phrases:** There are a few places where the phrasing could be slightly clearer to improve readability.
*   **Conclusion Could Be Stronger**: The conclusion restates the thesis but doesn't offer a strong final thought or implication of your findings.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Anacreon Example:** In the first paragraph, after presenting the Anacreon example, it might be helpful to explicitly state that you are showing how surface-level assumptions about the author's sexuality might be misleading when there are social motives in play.
*   **Halperin Quote:** The Halperin quote is good, but you could elaborate a little more on *why* this focus on penetration is significant.  What does it *mean* if sex is defined primarily by the act of penetration, rather than the gender of the participants?
*   **Pelops and Poseidon:**
    *   Emphasize the *scandal* of Pelops having a relationship with Poseidon. Why was it considered "unnatural"? Was it simply because it was with a god, or were there other factors?
    *   Clarify the connection between Poseidon's help and the marriage. How does one lead to the other?
*   **Timarchos:** Briefly explain *who* Timarchos was and *why* Aeschines was criticizing him. This context would help the reader understand the significance of the example.
*   **Winkler Quote on Identity**: Expand on what it means that "sexual identity does not organize the person." How does this contrast with modern understandings of identity?

**Example Revisions**

*   **Original:** "Because it is the â€˜masculine, penetrative' form that was seen to be the most fit to govern, sexual choices ultimately pointed to desires for personal, social, and/or political gain rather than any innate inclinations."
*   **Revised:** "Because the 'masculine, penetrative' role was associated with power and citizenship, sexual activity was often driven by a desire for personal, social, and political advancement, rather than simply personal preference."

*   **Original Conclusion**: "It is, unsurprisingly enough, the same brand of self-interested sexuality which would appall and disgust even many impious minds of today."
*   **Revised Conclusion**: "Ultimately, ancient Greek 'sexuality' was a complex and fluid system, less about individual desire and more about maintaining and reinforcing social hierarchies. This instrumental use of sexuality, so different from modern notions of individual identity and expression, reveals a society where social standing was inextricably linked to one's place in the power structure, even within the most intimate realms. This perspective on sexuality may feel foreign or even unethical to modern readers, because it challenges our assumptions about love, desire, and the individual, highlighting the profound differences in how societies construct and regulate these fundamental aspects of human experience."

**Grading Considerations (If Applicable)**

Based on the strengths I identified, this paper likely deserves a high grade (A- or above). Addressing the areas for improvement would further strengthen the essay and potentially raise it to an A.

**In summary, this is a very strong paper with a compelling argument. By adding a bit more context, addressing potential counterarguments, and refining the clarity of some phrases, you can make it even stronger.**
