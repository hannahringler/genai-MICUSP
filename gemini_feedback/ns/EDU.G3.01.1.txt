Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper proposal. To give you the most useful feedback, I need to consider the following:

*   **What is the purpose of this paper/proposal?** (e.g., get approval for a dissertation, secure funding, present at a conference)
*   **Who is the intended audience?** (e.g., dissertation committee, funding agency, conference attendees)
*   **What are the specific criteria or guidelines you're being evaluated against?** (If you have a rubric, please provide it).

**However, even without knowing the specifics, I can offer general feedback:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Important Topic:** The topic of national identity formation in young children within multicultural societies is timely and significant. The focus on the role of schools is particularly relevant.
*   **Strong Theoretical Framework:** You demonstrate a good grasp of relevant theories from sociology of childhood, political science (discourse analysis of national identity), and education (nationalizing function of schools).
*   **Well-Defined Concepts:** You take the time to define key terms like national identity, nationalism, patriotism, civic education, and citizenship education, which is crucial for a clear and rigorous argument.
*   **Comparative Approach:** Choosing to compare Singapore and the United States is a valuable strategy. You clearly articulate why these two countries are good comparison cases.
*   **Contextualized Analysis:** You recognize the importance of understanding the historical and socio-political contexts of both Singapore and the U.S. The discussion of 1965 as a pivotal year for both countries is compelling.
*   **Critical Perspective:** You avoid simplistic or celebratory narratives about citizenship education. You acknowledge the potential for indoctrination and the need for critical thinking.
*   **Comprehensive Literature Review:** The paper demonstrates a good command of relevant literature and research. The reference list is extensive and well-organized.
*   **Clearly Stated Research Questions:** You outline the key questions your dissertation will address.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Specificity in Research Methods:** This is the most significant area that needs attention. While you outline the theoretical framework and the overall topic, the proposal lacks details about *how* you will actually conduct your research.
    *   What specific *methods* will you use to collect data (e.g., interviews, classroom observations, document analysis)?
    *   Who will be your *participants* (e.g., how many schools, how many children, age range, demographic information)?
    *   How will you *analyze* the data you collect (e.g., thematic analysis of interviews, discourse analysis of textbooks)?
*   **Dissertation Structure:** While this paper acts as a justification for your comparison, it doesn't clarify how this will translate into your actual dissertation structure. Consider including a chapter outline or a brief overview of your dissertation. This would help your audience understand how all the different components are going to come together.
*   **Clarify Comparative Framework:** Explicitly state *what aspects* of citizenship education you will be comparing across the two countries. What specific policies, practices, curricula, or materials will you analyze?
*   **Address Potential Limitations:** Acknowledge any potential limitations of your study (e.g., limitations of comparative research, access to schools, generalizability of findings).
*   **Consider Alternative Explanations:** What other factors, besides schooling, might influence national identity formation in young children? Acknowledge these alternative explanations to strengthen your argument.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Methodology Section:** Add a detailed methodology section (if not already required). Describe your data collection and analysis plans. This is crucial.
*   **Refine the Introduction:** While the introduction is good, consider ending it with a more explicit statement of your research questions and how the paper will address them.
*   **Strengthen the Conclusion:** Summarize your key arguments and highlight the potential contributions of your dissertation to the field.
*   **"So What?" Factor:** Make sure the paper clearly answers the "So what?" question. Why is this research important and who will benefit from it?
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper carefully for any grammatical errors or typos.

**Revised Example of Research Question and dissertation structure section:**

>   "Through a unique multi-disciplinary study across education, childhood studies, and political science, my research will: i) demonstrate how young students make sense of nationalizing projects of which they are often primary objects; ii) provide a description of how two distinct societies engage schools in the process of national identity development, and iii) contribute to a broader understanding of how multicultural nations respond similarly or differently to the critical challenges of a rapidly evolving global demography. **My dissertation will analyze these points through the following chapters. The first two will cover the educational and political landscape in Singapore and the USA respectively, before my third and fourth chapters present the findings of my student interviews and classroom observations. These two chapters will explore the effectiveness of education in relation to patriotism and civic duty, and analyze the overall student's response to each. "**

**Next Steps:**
