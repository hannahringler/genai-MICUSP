Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and overall impact.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper is well-organized and clearly articulates the writer's goal: to demonstrate their ability to use purposeful questioning in a math lesson on tessellations. The writer effectively uses specific examples (Discussion A and B) from the lesson transcript to illustrate their points. The paper adheres to the given prompt/focus, which is asking purposeful questions.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis/Focus:** The introduction clearly states the paper's purpose and connects it to the principles learned from Chapin's *Classroom Discussions*.
*   **Specific Examples:** The use of direct quotes from the lesson transcript with timestamps strengthens the analysis. The writer doesn't just claim they asked effective questions; they provide evidence.
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper follows a logical flow, moving from general principles to specific examples. Discussion A covers initial thoughts. Discussion B is then used for Laura's probing and then Evan's probing.
*   **Reflection:** The writer reflects on the impact of their questioning, explaining why it was effective in eliciting student understanding, addressing misconceptions, and connecting concepts.
*   **Demonstrates Understanding:** The paper clearly shows an understanding of effective teaching strategies, such as eliciting initial ideas, probing for understanding, and connecting concepts.
*   **Good use of evidence to support claims:** The writer does well at providing specific examples to support the claims they make.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Analysis:** While the paper provides good examples, it could benefit from deeper analysis. Consider expanding on the "why" behind the effectiveness of the questions.
    *   For example, when discussing probing Laura's answer, the writer could elaborate on *why* confirming Laura's understanding is important. What are the potential consequences of not doing so?
    *   In the segment on connecting angles and tessellations, explain more thoroughly *how* the questions facilitated this connection. What specific cognitive processes were students engaging in?
*   **More Context:** While the paper is generally clear, a bit more context about the students themselves could be helpful. Knowing more about their prior knowledge or typical learning styles might strengthen the analysis.
*   **Refine Transitions:** The transitions between paragraphs and examples could be smoother. Use transition words or phrases to help the reader follow the argument. For example, "Building upon this approach..." or "In addition to eliciting initial ideas..."

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Expand on the Importance of Addressing Misconceptions:** In the Discussion A analysis (the rhombus misconception), you could add a sentence or two about why it's crucial to address misconceptions early in a lesson. What happens if the students misunderstand the shapes?
*   **Elaborate on the Rationale for Questioning Strategies:** When discussing the "thumbs up/down" technique, explain the benefits of this method beyond just getting a quick sense of the class's understanding. Does it encourage participation from shy students? Does it help students self-assess their own comprehension?
*   **Strengthen the Conclusion:** The conclusion is a bit brief. You could strengthen it by summarizing the key takeaways from the lesson and reinforcing the importance of purposeful questioning in math education.
*   **Consider adding the question that prompted Evan to share his idea:** You mentioned that you refraised his contribution to see if you understood, but the question that prompted him to give the idea is missing.

**Revised Snippets (Examples):**

*   **Original:** "I was able to verify that Laura could use the definition of tessellation to support her answer."
*   **Revised:** "I was able to verify that Laura could use the definition of tessellation to support her answer, ensuring she truly understood the concept and could apply it, rather than simply guessing correctly."

*   **Original:** "The discussions that transpired in my math lesson reflect my ability to skillfully ask purposeful questions when leading a whole-class discussion."
*   **Revised:** "The discussions in my math lesson exemplify how purposeful questioning techniques can be used to unlock deeper student understanding, guide mathematical reasoning, and foster a more inclusive learning environment."

**Overall:**

This is a solid paper that demonstrates a good understanding of effective questioning techniques. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can elevate the analysis and make the paper even more compelling. Good job!
