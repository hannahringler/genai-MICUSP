Okay, I can provide feedback on this essay! To give you the most helpful feedback, I'll focus on several key aspects:

**Overall Impression**

This is a well-structured and researched essay with a clear argument. The writer demonstrates a good understanding of the historical evolution of American education and its complex relationship with democracy and integration. The essay is generally well-written and uses historical evidence effectively.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis statement in the introduction clearly outlines the central argument. The essay will argue that American education has succeeded only partially in integration and has failed to instill values of a democratic and pluralistic society.

*   **Historical Context:** The essay provides a strong historical overview of American education from the early republic to the present.

*   **Use of Evidence:** The essay supports its claims with specific historical examples, quotations from key figures, and references to relevant research. The reference to the McGuffey Readers and its impact on education in the United States helped to bolster the overall strength of the paper.

*   **Structure and Organization:** The essay is logically organized, with each section focusing on a specific time period or aspect of the argument.

*   **Counterarguments:** Acknowledging the complexities of the issue, the essay hints at counterarguments or nuanced perspectives.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Integration vs. Assimilation:** The paper makes a great argument that United States schools are prone to assimilation instead of the true meaning of integration. While the paper references it, further emphasizing the difference between the two would improve the strength of that argument.

*   **Deeper Analysis of the Progressive Era:** The essay touches on the Progressive Era and the rise of social efficiency, but it could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the tensions between progressive ideals and the social realities of the time. How did these tensions manifest in the classroom? What were the consequences for different groups of students?

*   **Further Development of the "Mask of Democracy" Concept:** The introduction mentions that American education has used "the mask of democracy" to hide a system that disadvantages certain groups. This is a compelling idea, but it could be developed more fully throughout the essay. Provide more specific examples of how this "mask" operates. How is the idea of meritocracy used to justify inequality?

*   **More Discussion of Contemporary Issues:** While the essay touches on the No Child Left Behind Act, it could benefit from a more extended discussion of contemporary challenges facing American education.

*   **Stronger Conclusion:** The conclusion is a bit weak. It reiterates the thesis but doesn't offer a particularly insightful or memorable ending. Try to end with a more powerful statement about the future of American education and its potential to promote democracy and integration.

*   **Consider Citation Style:** Make sure the citation style is consistent throughout (MLA, Chicago, etc.).

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Progressive Era Analysis:** Deepen the discussion of how "social efficiency" in the Progressive Era reinforced existing social inequalities. Connect the ideas of Taylorism and factory models to the tracking systems that emerged in schools.

*   **Tracking and its Impact:** Expand the discussion of tracking to include more concrete examples of how it limits opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

*   **NCLB:** What effects are being observed? Is it truly leading to more democratic outcomes or is it perpetuating and potentially exacerbating existing inequalities?

**Final Thoughts**

Overall, this is a strong essay that demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. By addressing the areas for improvement, the writer can further strengthen their argument and create a more compelling and insightful piece of scholarship.

I hope this feedback is helpful!
