Okay, here's some feedback on the paper "Locke on Primary and Secondary Qualities," focusing on clarity, argumentation, and academic conventions.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of Locke's arguments regarding primary and secondary qualities. It presents Locke's position clearly and attempts to defend it. However, the paper could be strengthened by:
*   Addressing potential counterarguments or weaknesses in Locke's reasoning more explicitly.
*   Providing more detailed explanations of complex philosophical concepts.
*   Adding more diverse critical engagement, not just summarizing.
*   Including an introduction and conclusion with a clear thesis statement.

**Specific Feedback:**

**1. Introduction and Thesis:**
*   **Missing Introduction:** The paper launches directly into the topic. An introduction is needed to provide context, briefly state the central claim about Locke's argument, and outline the paper's structure. For example: "John Locke sought to establish the existence of an external world through empirical perception, differentiating between primary and secondary qualities. This paper will examine Locke's argument, highlighting its strengths in observations and how primary qualities lead to a reliable belief about an external world."
*   **Thesis Clarity:** The central argument of *your* paper should be stated clearly. Are you simply explaining Locke, or are you defending his argument, critiquing it, or comparing it to another philosopher? The reader needs to know what to expect.

**2. Clarity and Explanation:**

*   **Explain "Inference to the Best Explanation":** The paper repeatedly mentions this principle, but doesn't thoroughly explain it. While philosophy students might know the term, it's best to clearly define it for the reader. How does it work? What are its strengths and weaknesses as a method of justification?
*   **Deeper Dive into Primary vs. Secondary Qualities:** While the definitions are provided, consider exploring *why* Locke makes this distinction and what's at stake. Why does he think our perception of secondary qualities is unreliable? How does this unreliability affect our overall understanding of the world?
*   **Examples:** While the pineapple and fire examples are good, consider adding more examples to illustrate Locke's points.
*   **"Inductively Strong":** Explain what you mean by "inductively strong." How does it differ from deductive validity, and why is this important to Locke's argument?

**3. Argumentation and Analysis:**

*   **Address Counterarguments:** A strong paper anticipates and responds to potential objections. For example:
    *   **Objection to Locke's observations:** Someone might argue that Locke's observations are not as self-evident as he assumes. Are there alternative explanations for these experiences?
    *   **Objection to inference to the best explanation:** Some philosophers argue that inference to the best explanation is not a reliable method of gaining knowledge.
    *   **The problem of the external world:** Skeptics may question whether the knowledge of an external world is possible. Are we really able to know the world exists beyond our perception?
*   **Go Beyond Summary:** The paper often summarizes Locke's arguments. To improve, analyze the arguments more deeply. Are there hidden assumptions? Are there logical gaps?
*   **Critical Engagement:** The paper states that Locke's argument is inductively strong. On what basis do you claim this? What are the weaknesses? What makes the conclusion "very unlikely to be false"?
*   **Acknowledge Locke's Limitations:** You could consider mentioning the limitations of Locke's empiricism. What are some common criticisms of his approach?

**4. Academic Conventions:**

*   **Consistent Citations:** Ensure that all citations are consistent and follow a specific style guide (e.g., MLA, Chicago). Pay attention to punctuation, capitalization, and the order of information.
*   **Works Cited/Bibliography:** Add a works cited or bibliography section to provide full details for all cited sources.
*   **"I" Statement:** Avoid using "I" unless it is used to acknowledge your perspective. Instead, rephrase in terms of argument, e.g. "This paper argues..."
*   **Concluding Statement:** A conclusion is needed to summarize main points and close with a statement about the overall significance. Consider ending with a statement about the broader implications of Locke's views on perception and knowledge.
*   **Topic Sentences:** Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that indicates the main point of the paragraph.

**5. Specific Line Edits:**

*   "something than the sense organs" should be "something *other* than the sense organs"
*   "vivid feelings such as pain or pleasure (Locke 1690, 203). If these experiences were caused in the mind, Locke argues, then thinking of them should cause pain (Locke 1690, 203)" - This is redundant.

**Revised Example Snippet (with Introduction):**

"The 17th-century philosopher John Locke grappled with the fundamental question of how we can know that an external world exists independent of our perceptions. His answer, rooted in empiricism, hinges on a distinction between primary qualities (inherent properties of objects) and secondary qualities (subjective experiences caused by those objects). **This paper argues that while Locke's distinction between primary and secondary qualities offers a valuable framework for understanding perception, his reliance on "inference to the best explanation" is not fully convincing and leaves his argument vulnerable to skeptical challenges.**

Locke initiates his defense with a series of observations that challenge the notion that sensory experiences are solely products of our minds.  If sensory experiences were caused by the senses alone, then, as Locke argues, individuals would possess the ability to conjure any sensory experience at will (Locke 1690, 202). However, such control is demonstrably absent..."

**In summary,** this paper shows a good understanding of Locke's arguments. By adding an introduction and conclusion, explaining complex concepts more thoroughly, addressing potential objections, and deepening the analysis, you can significantly strengthen the paper and elevate it to a higher level. Remember to ensure consistent citation and to avoid overusing the pronoun "I."
