Okay, I can provide some feedback on this paper. I'll focus on aspects like clarity, argumentation, structure, and overall effectiveness.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles an interesting and complex topic: the future of corporate responsibility and sustainability. It shows a good grasp of the issues and presents a thoughtful, if somewhat pessimistic, view. However, the paper could benefit from a stronger, more focused argument, clearer organization, and more robust evidence.

**Specific Feedback:**

*   **Introduction:**

    *   The introduction is a bit broad. It introduces the topic of NGOs and corporate environmentalism but could be more concise and directly state the paper's thesis. What specific argument are you making about the future of corporate responsibility? A clear thesis statement is crucial.
    *   The "greenness" of corporations is a good start.

*   **Argumentation and Analysis:**

    *   The paper presents several interesting points: the potential exploitation of emerging markets, the limitations of CSR, and the need for corporate commitment to climate change mitigation. However, these points feel somewhat disconnected. The paper needs a stronger overarching argument that ties these points together.
    *   **Emerging Markets**: Good discussion of issues.
    *   **Should Business Develop a Conscious**: CSR can be a self-serving tool for profit.
    *   **Corporate Commitments to Climate Change Mitigation**: Good that you see climate change as a risk that corporations must recognize.
    *   There are some strong statements ("CSR is not an altruistic behavior," "the public will eventually discover to be fraudulent") that need more supporting evidence and analysis. Why do you believe this so strongly? What examples can you provide?
    *   The paper leans toward a pessimistic view of corporate motives. While this may be a valid perspective, it's important to acknowledge potential counterarguments and provide a balanced analysis. Are there any examples of companies genuinely committed to sustainability?
    *   Consider using economic theories as tools for your analysis. Game Theory, for example, might be used to analyze competition of resource-exploitation.

*   **Structure and Organization:**

    *   The paper's structure could be improved. Consider organizing the paper around a central argument, with each section providing evidence and analysis to support that argument. A clear outline would be helpful.
    *   Transitions between paragraphs and sections could be smoother. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and guide the reader through your argument.

*   **Evidence and Support:**

    *   The paper cites some sources, but could benefit from more robust evidence to support its claims. Use a variety of sources, including academic articles, industry reports, and case studies.
    *   When citing sources, be sure to follow a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).
    *   The numerical annotations are not very helpful if the sources are not available directly below.

*   **Clarity and Style:**

    *   The writing is generally clear, but there are some areas where it could be more concise and precise.
    *   Avoid overly broad or vague statements. Be specific in your claims and provide concrete examples.
    *   Proofread carefully for grammar and spelling errors.

*   **Conclusion:**

    *   The conclusion summarizes the main points of the paper and offers a final thought. However, it could be more impactful by restating the thesis and highlighting the key implications of your analysis.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Develop a Clear Thesis:** Formulate a specific argument about the future of corporate responsibility. What is your central claim?
2.  **Strengthen the Argument:** Provide more evidence and analysis to support your claims. Address potential counterarguments and offer a balanced perspective.
3.  **Improve Structure:** Organize the paper around a central argument, with each section contributing to the overall thesis.
4.  **Enhance Evidence:** Use a wider range of sources to support your claims.
5.  **Refine Writing:** Ensure clarity, conciseness, and precision in your writing. Proofread carefully.

**In Summary:**

This paper has the potential to be a strong and insightful analysis of the future of corporate responsibility. By focusing on clarifying the argument, strengthening the evidence, and improving the structure, you can significantly enhance the paper's effectiveness.
