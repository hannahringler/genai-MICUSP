Here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a well-reasoned argument for diversifying communities of practice in higher education. It effectively uses the concept of communities of practice as a framework to analyze issues of inclusion, innovation, and student learning. The writing is generally clear and demonstrates a good understanding of the literature.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The paper clearly states the purpose of identifying and describing areas in higher education that could benefit from diversity.
*   **Well-Defined Framework:** The application of "communities of practice" provides a strong and consistent framework for analysis.
*   **Solid Literature Review:** The paper demonstrates a good grasp of relevant literature and appropriately integrates it into the argument. The use of quotes and citations is effective.
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, building from a general overview to specific areas (innovation, student learning) and potential solutions.
*   **Balanced Argument:** The paper acknowledges potential challenges or downsides to interdisciplinary approaches (e.g., the "lack of currency" in reward systems, potential for conflict).
*   **Practical Suggestions:** The paper includes suggestions for creating more inclusive communities of practice (e.g., early undergraduate involvement, exposing students to diverse epistemologies).

**Weaknesses**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper covers a lot of ground, some sections could benefit from deeper analysis and elaboration. For example, the discussion of specific strategies for increasing diversity in mathematics could be more detailed.
*   **Lack of Original Research:** The paper relies almost entirely on secondary sources. Incorporating primary research (e.g., interviews, surveys, case studies) could strengthen the argument and add originality.
*   **Abstract/Introduction Needs Punch:** The intro could be more engaging to immediately pull the reader in. It could include the issues and the main point sooner.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Develop the Introduction:** Start with a more captivating opening, perhaps a compelling anecdote or statistic that highlights the problem of homogeneity in higher education. More broadly, ensure that the introduction clearly defines the communities of practice framework and its significance to your argument.
2.  **Elaborate on Key Examples:** When discussing specific examples of interdisciplinary programs or initiatives (e.g., Miami University course), provide more details about the program structure, student outcomes, and challenges encountered.
3.  **Strengthen the Analysis of "Power":** The paper mentions power dynamics in academic communities but could benefit from a more explicit discussion of how power structures contribute to exclusion and homogeneity. Consider exploring the work of scholars who focus on critical race theory, feminist theory, or other perspectives that address power relations.
4.  **Address Practical Obstacles:** When discussing potential solutions, be sure to acknowledge and address the practical obstacles to implementation. For example, how can universities overcome the "lack of currency" for interdisciplinary work? What strategies can be used to manage conflict that arises from uncovering methodological disagreements?
5.  **Conclusion is Somewhat Weak:** It could be more of a "call to action". Suggest concrete steps universities, departments, and faculty can take to diversify communities of practice. End with a thought-provoking statement about the importance of diversity for the future of higher education.

**Specific Points**

*   **Page 1, Cheney Quote:** This is a strong opening quote, but perhaps balance it with a counterpoint or a transition that highlights the internal diversity within academic institutions, setting up the central argument.
*   **Page 13, Mathematics Example:** This is a good example to illustrate the problem of exclusion. Consider adding specific recommendations for how mathematics departments can create more inclusive communities of practice.
*   **Page 16, "Borders and Centers":** This is a key point. Ensure that the distinction between borders and centers is clear and that you explain the benefits of access to both.

**Overall Grade**
Assuming this is a university level essay, it will likely get a B+ or an A- right now. With my recommendations it will get an A.

This feedback should help you refine your paper and strengthen your argument. Good luck!
