Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on its strengths and areas for improvement, considering it as an academic essay:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper has a strong premise, drawing a parallel between historical and contemporary immigration issues in the US. It's a relevant and important topic.  The research appears solid, and the author demonstrates an awareness of key historical events and legislation. The conclusion offers a reflective and optimistic viewpoint.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The introduction clearly states the essay's purpose: to compare issues of immigration and education in the early 20th century with present-day concerns, focusing on English language instruction, immigrant children's progress, and Americanization curricula/restrictionism.
*   **Historical Context:** The paper provides a decent overview of the historical context of immigration in the early 20th century, mentioning key events, such as the National Origins Act of 1924, and societal attitudes.
*   **Specific Examples:** The paper includes specific examples to support its claims, such as the mention of ethnic newspapers advocating for English language learning and the story of the teacher who called a student a "dirty little Russian Jew."
*   **Comparison:** The essay makes a direct comparison with Proposition 227 and present day debates.
*   **Use of Sources:** The paper appropriately cites sources.
*   **Relevant Topics:** The topics of language instruction, school progress, and restrictive immigration policies are all very relevant to the stated theme.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper identifies similarities, it could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the *differences* between the historical and contemporary contexts.  For example:
    *   How has the perception of immigrants changed?
    *   How do current immigration laws differ from the past?
    *   How has the composition of immigrant groups changed?
    *   What is the role of technology and globalization in shaping current immigration patterns and debates?

*   **Expand on the "Americanization" Curricula:**  The paper mentions curricula of Americanization. A deeper dive into what these curricula entailed both historically and today would strengthen the argument. What values were being promoted, and how were they being conveyed? Was it just English language acquisition, or did it go further?

*   **Contemporary Context:** The paper should provide more detail about present day debates. Expand on Proposition 227, modern restrictionist policies, and the current cultural context.

*   **Strengthen Argument with Data:** Consider incorporating more contemporary data on immigrant student performance, English language acquisition rates, or the impact of immigration policies on educational outcomes. Citing relevant reports, studies, or statistical data could enhance the essay's credibility.

*   **Address Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments. For example, one could argue that current programs are not as restrictive as policies of the past. It's important to consider alternate views to strengthen your argument.

*   **Clarity and Specificity:** Some sentences could be more precise. For example, "Although teachers are not likely to overtly denigrate a child..." is vague. Give specific examples of how teachers ARE likely to handle such a situation.

*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is somewhat generic. It could be made stronger by summarizing the key comparisons and providing a more insightful or thought-provoking final statement. The final lines could more explicitly link the historical understanding to a call for specific action or policy changes in the present.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Expand on Differences:** Dedicate a section to outlining the key differences between the early 20th century and today. Consider economic, social, and political differences.
*   **Develop the "Americanization" Point:** What specifically did these curricula look like in the past and today? How have the aims and methods of Americanization changed?
*   **Elaborate on NCLB:** Instead of just mentioning "No Child Left Behind," explain in greater detail how it impacts immigrant students' education and how its effect compares to policies of the past.
*   **Improve Introduction and Conclusion:** Revise the introduction to have a strong hook, a more detailed thesis statement, and provide a stronger preview of the essay's main points. The conclusion should be more than just a summary; it should offer a synthesis of the arguments and leave the reader with a lasting impression.

**Overall:**

The paper has a solid foundation and potential. By addressing the areas outlined above, the author can elevate it to a more sophisticated and persuasive academic essay. Remember to focus on depth of analysis, specific examples, and a well-supported argument.
