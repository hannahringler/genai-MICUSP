Okay, I can give you some feedback on this paper based on the OCR text you provided.  Please keep in mind that without knowing the specific assignment guidelines or the professor's expectations, my feedback will be somewhat general.

**Overall Impressions:**

The paper demonstrates a solid understanding of the philosophical concepts presented by Moore, Ayer, and Hare regarding the meaning of "wrong." It attempts to synthesize these perspectives and offer an original viewpoint. The structure is logical, and the writing is generally clear. However, some areas could be strengthened for greater clarity, depth, and persuasiveness.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis, stating that there isn't one thing we mean when we call an act wrong and that the paper will explore this using Moore, Ayer, and Hare, is presented upfront.
*   **Understanding of Source Material:** The paper accurately summarizes the key arguments of Moore, Ayer, and Hare. The use of direct quotes is effective in demonstrating this understanding.
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper follows a logical progression, first outlining the views of the three philosophers, then presenting the student's own perspective.
*   **Attempt at Original Thought:** The paper goes beyond simply summarizing the philosophers and attempts to offer an original argument about the multiple meanings of "wrong."

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper summarizes the philosophers well, the analysis could go deeper. For instance, the paper could explore the potential criticisms of each philosopher's view or delve into the nuances of their arguments.
*   **Clarity of Original Argument:** The student's own argument, particularly in the later sections, needs to be clarified and made more persuasive. The section about subject-specificity and inconsistency could benefit from more concrete examples and a clearer explanation of why this doesn't necessarily invalidate the concept of "wrong."
*   **Addressing Counterarguments:** The paper briefly acknowledges a potential counterargument regarding consistency but could do more to anticipate and respond to other objections to the student's view.
*   **Specificity and Examples:** Using more concrete examples to illustrate the abstract philosophical concepts would make the paper more accessible and engaging. For instance, when discussing the "property of badness," providing a specific example of an act and how that property might manifest would be helpful.
*   **Engage with the "So What?" Question:** The paper could benefit from explicitly addressing the significance of its argument. Why does it matter that there isn't a single meaning of "wrong"? What are the implications of this for ethical decision-making or moral philosophy?

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Moore:** In the section on Moore, clarify the connection between intuition and moral knowledge. How does Moore think we access this non-natural property of "badness"?
*   **Ayer:** When discussing Ayer's emotivism, explore the criticisms of this view. For example, some argue that emotivism leads to moral relativism or makes moral discourse meaningless.
*   **Hare:** In the section on Hare, elaborate on the concept of universalizability. What are the potential problems with this requirement?
*   **Student's Argument:**
    *   The idea of subject-specificity needs further development. What factors might lead someone to believe that an action is wrong for them but not for others?
    *   Provide more examples of situations where someone might believe an act is "technically" wrong but still acceptable. The Jean Valjean example is a good start, but more examples would strengthen the argument.
    *   Explain the relationship between expressing feelings and asserting feelings more clearly. What is the difference, and why is this distinction important?
    *   More explicitly connect the original argument back to the theories of Moore, Ayer, and Hare. How does the student's view incorporate or reject aspects of each theory?
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion could be stronger by summarizing the main points of the argument and reiterating the thesis in a more nuanced way. It should also address the "so what?" question, as mentioned above.

**In summary:**

The paper shows promise, demonstrating a good grasp of the core concepts. By deepening the analysis, clarifying the original argument, addressing counterarguments, and providing more concrete examples, the student can elevate the paper to a higher level.
