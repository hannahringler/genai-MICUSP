Okay, I've reviewed the paper and here's some feedback, focusing on aspects like clarity, argumentation, structure, and potential areas for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents an interesting and well-structured analysis of stress patterns in Hawaiian, utilizing Optimality Theory (OT). The paper attempts to address the variations in the stress patterns from the previously documented ones. The author shows a solid understanding of OT and its application to phonological phenomena. However, the paper might benefit from further clarification of certain arguments, and a more in-depth discussion of alternative analyses or potential counterarguments.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Introduction:** The introduction clearly outlines the problem being addressed, the existing literature, and the proposed solution.
*   **Solid Theoretical Framework:** The paper effectively employs OT as a framework for analyzing the data.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The analysis of Hawaiian stress patterns, including compounds, affixes, and reduplication, is detailed and well-supported by examples.
*   **Good Use of Examples:** The examples are clearly presented and used effectively to illustrate the arguments.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper is generally well-organized, with a logical flow of ideas.
*   **Formal Account:** The Optimality Theoretic Account presents a formal view of the stress patterns.

**Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Clarity and Elaboration:**

    *   **Terminology:** While the author demonstrates a good grasp of OT, some readers unfamiliar with specific terminology might find the paper challenging. Consider adding more explicit definitions or explanations of key OT concepts (e.g., "gradient constraint," "demarcative properties") when they are first introduced.
    *   **Motivation:** The section "Morphological Structure" contains the statement "The proposal above, that Hawaiian has a bidirectional stress system, applies to all prosodic words, with the assumption that prosodic word structure may be recursive, such that the maximal prosodic word may dominate multiple, word-internal prosodic words." The motivation for proposing a recursive prosodic structure could be expanded upon to make it clear to the reader the benefits and consequences that will result from this approach.
    *   **Constraint Ranking:** The reasoning behind some of the constraint rankings could be further elaborated. For example, why is ALL-FT-L dominated by ALL-WD-R? Providing more explicit explanations would strengthen the argument.
    *   **Tableau Explanation:** Some of the tableaux could benefit from more detailed explanations. Briefly walking the reader through the evaluation process for each candidate would make the analysis more accessible.

2.  **Addressing Potential Counterarguments/Alternative Analyses:**

    *   **Lexical Stress:** It is mentioned in the paper that the Hayes (1995) suggestion of secondary stress is abandoned because of lexical specification. Further addressing this by discussing the limitations of the approach in comparison to your approach of OT analysis may increase the strength of the paper.
    *   **Alternatives:** Are there other OT analyses of Hawaiian stress? If so, briefly discussing and contrasting them with your own would strengthen the argument. What are the potential weaknesses of your analysis, and how might they be addressed?

3.  **Refining the Argument:**

    *   **Bidirectional Stress:** The idea of bidirectional stress is interesting. Exploring the theoretical implications of this approach more fully could add depth to the paper. Are there languages where bidirectional stress is more prominent or better understood? Can insights from those languages be applied to Hawaiian?
    *   **Exception Handling:** You acknowledge the exception of "‘ule‘uleu." While it's good to recognize the limitation, consider briefly discussing potential avenues for future research to address this exception. Could it be due to some morphological or historical factor?

4.  **Minor Edits and Style:**

    *   **Proofread Carefully:**  A careful proofread can catch minor errors in grammar and punctuation. For example, in the phrase "system that treats each member of a compound as it's own prosodic word," it should be "its own."
    *   **Conciseness:**  In a few places, sentences could be made more concise and direct.

**Specific Questions to Consider:**

*   Is the assumption that prefixes (including reduplicated structure) and compounds create their own prosodic words within a maximal prosodic word is the correct approach? Does this align with typological trends?
*   Are there other languages with similar stress patterns to Hawaiian, and how are those patterns analyzed?
*   What are the testable predictions of your analysis? How could your analysis be falsified?

**In summary:**

This is a strong paper with a well-defined analysis of Hawaiian stress. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, the paper can become even more compelling and persuasive. Focusing on clarity, addressing potential counterarguments, and further refining the argumentation will elevate the paper to a higher level.
