Okay, I can give you some feedback on this paper based on the OCR text provided. Please keep in mind that without being able to assess the original formatting or the specific requirements of the assignment, this feedback will be somewhat general.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper seems to present a coherent argument about the motivations for war among Assyrian and Persian kings, focusing on the similarities despite some differences in approach. The paper identifies religious motivations, pursuit of glory, and retribution as key common factors, ultimately arguing that these were often facades for the more fundamental goals of territorial expansion and wealth acquisition.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis Statement:** The introduction clearly states the paper's thesis: that religious motivations, retribution, and the pursuit of glory were common motivations, but ultimately functioned to increase territory and wealth.

*   **Evidence-Based Argument:** The paper draws on Sargon's Letter to Assur and Herodotus' *Histories* as primary sources to support its claims, citing specific examples.

*   **Comparative Approach:** The paper effectively compares and contrasts the Assyrian and Persian approaches to war and conquest.

*   **Critical Analysis:** The paper doesn't simply present information but analyzes the motivations behind the kings' actions, suggesting that religious and other justifications were often used to mask more pragmatic goals.

*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure, presenting its arguments in a clear and organized manner.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Development of Argument:** While the paper identifies key motivations, it could benefit from further development of each point. For example:
    *   Religious Motivations: Explore the specific religious beliefs of the Assyrians and Persians and how these beliefs influenced their decisions to go to war.
    *   Glory and Honor: Delve deeper into the cultural significance of glory and honor in these societies. How did these concepts shape the kings' identities and their relationships with their subjects?
    *   Retribution: Provide more specific examples of how the kings used retribution as a justification for war. What types of offenses did they consider worthy of retaliation?
    *    Wealth and Resources: Why does the author assume this is a key motivation? Wealth may have also been a key indicator of success. This may be a good opportunity for additional analysis.

*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While the paper argues that religious and other motivations were often facades, it's important to acknowledge the possibility that these factors were genuinely held beliefs. The kings may have used these justifications to rally support for their wars. The religious beliefs of the common people may have also been a driving factor of warfare.

*   **Evidence and Examples:**
    *   Provide direct quotes from Sargon's Letter to Assur and Herodotus' *Histories* to support your claims.
    *   Use footnotes or endnotes to provide additional context for your evidence.
    *   Explain the historical context of your evidence.

*   **Clarity and Precision:** There are a few instances where the language could be more precise:
    *   Use more formal and academic language.
    *   Make sure to define key terms.
    *   Check for grammar errors.

*   **Conclusion:** Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing the main points of the paper and reiterating the thesis statement. Consider adding a final thought-provoking statement that leaves the reader with a lasting impression.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Expand on the "Conquest-State" concept:** The paper mentions the concept of a conquest-state but doesn't fully develop it. Explain what a conquest-state is, how it functions, and why it's relevant to the Assyrian and Persian empires.

*   **Address Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments to your thesis. For example, some historians might argue that religious motivations were genuinely the primary drivers of war.

*   **Strengthen the Introduction:** Provide a broader historical context for the Assyrian and Persian empires and their motivations for war. This will help the reader understand the significance of your thesis.

*   **Review Citations:** Verify that all citations are accurate and consistent.

**Remember to:**

*   Proofread carefully for grammar and spelling errors.
*   Check the paper against the specific requirements of the assignment.

Overall, this is a good start to a well-researched and thoughtful paper. By addressing the areas for improvement, you can strengthen your argument and make your paper more persuasive.
