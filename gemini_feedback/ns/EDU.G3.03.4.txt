Here's some feedback on your paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions for enhancement:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis:** The paper clearly establishes the central argument: educational reforms often have unintended and negative consequences despite good intentions.
*   **Clear Organization:** The essay follows a logical structure, introducing the argument, presenting supporting examples (intelligence testing, tracking, platoon system), and concluding with recommendations.
*   **Use of Evidence:** You effectively incorporate historical evidence and scholarly sources to support your claims about the unintended consequences of each reform.
*   **Critical Analysis:** The paper demonstrates a critical perspective by questioning the purported benefits of these reforms and highlighting their negative impacts on students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
*   **Thoughtful Conclusion:** The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points, acknowledges the need for innovation, and offers practical recommendations for future reform efforts.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While you identify the unintended consequences, you could delve deeper into the mechanisms by which these consequences arose. For each reform, consider:
    *   *Initial Goals:* What were the explicit goals of the reform?
    *   *Underlying Assumptions:* What assumptions about students, schools, and society underpinned the reform?
    *   *Unintended Consequences:* What specific negative outcomes resulted from the reform?
    *   *Causes of Discrepancy:* Why did the reform fail to achieve its goals? What factors contributed to the unintended consequences?
*   **Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments. For example, proponents of intelligence testing might argue that it provides valuable information for student placement. You could then refute these arguments by highlighting the limitations and biases of such tests.
*   **Contemporary Relevance:** Make more explicit connections between the historical reforms and contemporary educational issues. How do the lessons learned from these past experiences inform current debates about education reform?
*   **Specificity:** Provide more specific examples to illustrate the negative consequences of each reform. For instance, instead of simply stating that tracking reinforces stereotypes, describe a specific scenario where a student is negatively affected by being placed in a lower track.
*   **Refine Introductions/Transitions:** While overall the essay is well organized, you can strengthen the introduction and transitions.
    *The introduction, specifically the sentence "As I have argued in previous journals, we cannot know reformers' intentions from their actions, or the result of those actions.", is vague.
    *Add a transition sentence between the explanation of each program (intelligence testing, tracking, and the platoon system).

**Suggestions for Enhancement:**

*   **Theoretical Framework:** Consider incorporating a theoretical framework to provide a deeper understanding of the unintended consequences of reform. For example, you could draw on sociological theories of social stratification, critical pedagogy, or organizational theory.
*   **Policy Recommendations:** Expand on your policy recommendations in the conclusion. Suggest specific strategies for promoting more equitable and effective educational reforms, such as community-based participatory research, culturally responsive pedagogy, and systemic approaches to addressing educational inequality.
*   **Voice and Style:** While the paper is well-written, consider experimenting with different rhetorical techniques to make your argument more persuasive. For example, you could use vivid language, anecdotes, or rhetorical questions to engage the reader and emphasize your points.
*   **Source Diversity:** While the sources are reliable, consider adding some more recent scholarship.

**Specific Comments:**

*   **Intelligence Testing:**
    *   Expand on the connection between intelligence testing and eugenics.
    *   Discuss the role of cultural bias in intelligence tests.
*   **Tracking:**
    *   Provide more evidence of the negative impact of tracking on student achievement and social mobility.
    *   Discuss the challenges of detracking and strategies for creating more equitable learning environments.
*   **Platoon System:**
    *   Elaborate on the trade-offs between maximizing the use of school facilities and providing quality instruction.
    *   Discuss the potential benefits of alternative scheduling models, such as block scheduling or year-round schooling.

By addressing these areas for improvement and incorporating the suggestions for enhancement, you can elevate your paper to a higher level of analysis and argumentation. Good luck!
