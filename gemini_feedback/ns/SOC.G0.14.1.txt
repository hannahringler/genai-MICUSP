Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, with feedback focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impressions**

The paper demonstrates a clear understanding of Urrea's *The Devil's Highway*. You provide a structured analysis, summarizing the book's parts and offering both praise and criticism. Your arguments are generally well-organized, and you support them with specific examples from the text.  However, some areas could benefit from further development and refinement.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Structure:** The paper presents a clear viewpoint, which is that *The Devil's Highway* is a valuable book despite some shortcomings. The structure, following the book's organization, allows for a systematic analysis.
*   **Detailed Summary and Analysis:** You provide a good summary of each section of the book and offer insightful analysis of Urrea's techniques, choices, and their effects on the reader.
*   **Specific Examples:** You support your claims with specific examples from the text, including quotes and descriptions of events. This makes your arguments more persuasive.
*   **Critical Engagement:** You don't just summarize; you critically engage with the text, questioning Urrea's choices and their effectiveness. You are not afraid to express your opinion and back it up with reasoning.
*   **Consideration of Audience Impact:** You consider how the book might affect readers' perceptions of Mexican immigrants and the complexities of the situation.
*   **Strong Voice:** You have a strong and clear voice throughout the paper, which makes it engaging to read.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Overgeneralization:** There are instances of overgeneralization, such as "many Americans believe...", which needs more support or a more specific framing.
    *   **Suggestion:**  Provide specific examples or cite sources to support claims about widespread beliefs. Alternatively, qualify the statement (e.g., "Some Americans believe...").

*   **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity:** While expressing your opinion is good, sometimes the paper veers too far into subjective statements without sufficient backing. For example, criticizing Urrea for including the hyperthermia stages because he has not experienced it is a somewhat personal criticism.
    *   **Suggestion:** Frame subjective criticisms more objectively. Instead of "Why would a reader believe Urrea...", try "This description might seem unnecessary to some readers, as the suffering has already been effectively portrayed." Focus on the *effect* on the reader, rather than your personal disbelief.

*   **Repetitive Criticism:** The criticism regarding Urrea's "condescending attitude" could be more nuanced. It's mentioned multiple times, and further elaboration on *how* this attitude is conveyed through language would strengthen the point.
    *   **Suggestion:**  Focus on a couple of the strongest examples of this condescending language and analyze them in detail. What specific words or phrases give you this impression? How might they be interpreted by different readers?

*   **Lack of Counterarguments:** While you critique Urrea's approach, consider acknowledging potential counterarguments to strengthen your analysis. For instance, you criticize the inclusion of the Aftermath section, but could there be a reason Urrea chose to include it, even if you disagree with the choice?
    *   **Suggestion:**  Briefly acknowledge possible counterarguments. For example, "While the Aftermath section may feel disjointed, it could be argued that Urrea included it to provide a broader context for the events." Then, explain why you still find it ineffective.

*   **Flow and Transitions:** Some transitions between ideas could be smoother.
    *   **Suggestion:** Pay attention to transitions between paragraphs and ideas. Use transition words and phrases to guide the reader (e.g., "However," "In addition," "Furthermore," "On the other hand," "As a result").

*   **Word Choice:** Consider refining some word choices for clarity and formality.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   "in-scene" could be replaced with "media res".
        *   "rants about other subjects with little relation" could be reworded for a more academic tone.

**Specific Examples and Suggestions:**

*   **Page 1:**  The opening paragraph is strong.
*   **Page 2:**  The criticism of the hyperthermia section is valid, but the reasoning could be strengthened (see above).
*   **Page 3:**  The critique of the *Aftermath* section is well-argued.
*   **Page 4:**  The statement "This book is very valuable because it develops compassion in the reader for people that might not otherwise receive it" is strong, but needs to be supported by the analysis. How does the book achieve this?
*   **Page 5:**  The criticism about Urrea's inability to specify the amount of money gathered could be interpreted as nitpicking. Consider reframing this criticism to focus on a broader point about Urrea's handling of factual details. The sentence "To downplay the loss of lives as the significant event is disrespectful" is strong, but needs to be grounded in specific examples of how Urrea allegedly downplays the loss of lives.
*   **Page 6:**  The phrase "Urrea suffered his greatest loss of credibility" is very strong. Be sure the following explanation is solid and specific. The concluding paragraph is good.
*   **Page 7:**  The concluding sentence is effective.

**In summary:**

Your paper demonstrates a solid understanding of *The Devil's Highway*. By refining your arguments, providing more concrete evidence, and addressing potential counterarguments, you can elevate this paper to an even higher level. Good job!
