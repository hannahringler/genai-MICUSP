Okay, I can provide feedback on your paper "The Representation of Jesus and Women in the Gospel of Mark."  I'll focus on the structure, argumentation, use of evidence, and clarity.

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a thoughtful analysis of the role of women in the Gospel of Mark, arguing that Mark highlights both their importance in Jesus' ministry and some potential reservations about their role as disciples. The analysis is well-structured and engages with the text effectively. However, the argument can be sharpened, and some claims need further development and support.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** You have a clear thesis that is explicitly stated, outlining the central argument: Mark gives weight to women's issues and emphasizes the role of women in the story, while still maintaining some reservations about their role.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure, progressing from a general introduction of the theme to specific textual examples and a concluding reflection.
*   **Good Use of Evidence:** You cite specific passages from Mark to support your claims, discussing the divorce passage in Mark 10, the hemorrhaging woman in Mark 5, and the women at the tomb in Mark 16.
*   **Awareness of Nuance:** You acknowledge that the positive portrayal of women is not unique to Mark and also note some complexities in how they are depicted.
*   **Engagement with Scholarship:** You reference Coogan's introduction to the Gospel of Mark, demonstrating your engagement with secondary sources.

**Areas for Improvement**

1.  **Sharpen the Argument:**

    *   While your thesis is clear, the balance between the "positive influence" and the "slight reservations" could be developed more explicitly. How *significant* are these reservations? Does the ending undermine the earlier portrayals, or is it more a reflection of human fallibility shared by men and women? Consider weighing the evidence more decisively.
    *   Connect the "social justice theme" more strongly. How does the inclusion and portrayal of women specifically contribute to the broader social justice message you identify?

2.  **Develop the Evidence and Analysis:**

    *   **Specificity:** When you introduce the social justice theme you mention interconnectedness between religion and sociopolitical/economic laws. You could offer an example of this interconnectedness in relation to women’s position in society and religious laws.
    *   **Expand the Analysis of Key Passages:**
        *   For Mark 10, while you mention the adultery statement, you could unpack the implications more fully. How radical was Jesus' stance on divorce in the context of Jewish law and social norms?
        *   For the hemorrhaging woman, you mention the story is important because it shows a seemingly "unclean" woman taking control. You could offer more about how she was considered “unclean” in society and how that made her an outcast, and how Jesus’ actions were revolutionary for the time period.
        *   The Mark 16 analysis is strong, but you could explore further *why* the women's fear and silence might be interpreted as a reservation about their devotion. Consider the cultural context and potential interpretations of their actions.
    *   **Addressing Counterarguments:** Consider potential counterarguments. For example, one might argue that the women's silence in Mark 16 is simply a realistic portrayal of fear and trauma after witnessing a supernatural event. Address these alternative perspectives.

3.  **Strengthen Connections and Transitions:**

    *   Ensure that the connections between paragraphs are clear and logical. Use transition words and phrases to guide the reader through your argument.
    *   Explicitly connect the discussion of individual stories back to your overall thesis.

4.  **Clarify and Refine Language:**

    *   Watch for vague language. For example, "a few specific subject matters emerge" could be more precise by naming those subject matters.
    *   "Looking closely at the words Jesus speaks concerning women's issues and briefly at the story of the hemorrhaging woman..." Consider revising for clarity. You do more than a brief analysis of this story.

5.  **Conclusion:** The ending is a little abrupt. Make sure to offer a strong concluding statement that summarizes the core argument and perhaps suggests some further avenues for exploration.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:** Instead of stating, "The Gospel of Mark offers valuable insight..." try beginning with a more captivating hook that immediately draws the reader in.
*   **Page 1:** Elaborate on the significance of women not holding the position of "disciple".
*   **Page 4:** When stating, “This positive aura of women in Mark, however, is obfuscated by the end of the Gospel," consider replacing “obfuscated” with a word that is less vague.

**Revised Thesis Options (Examples)**

Here are a few options for a revised thesis statement, depending on how you want to emphasize your argument:

*   "While the Gospel of Mark champions a progressive view of women by highlighting Jesus's interactions with them and addressing their concerns in his teachings, the ambiguous ending, in which the women flee in terror from the empty tomb, ultimately tempers the portrayal of their steadfast devotion, suggesting a complex and nuanced perspective on their role in the early Jesus movement."
*   "The Gospel of Mark leverages the stories of women, from Jesus's teachings on divorce to the healing of the hemorrhaging woman, to advance its broader theme of social justice, yet the ending of the Gospel, where the women flee the tomb in fear, reveals an underlying ambivalence towards the full inclusion of women as reliable witnesses and leaders within the nascent Christian community."

**In Summary**

Your paper shows a good understanding of the text and a thoughtful approach to the topic. By sharpening your argument, developing your evidence and analysis, and refining your language, you can create an even stronger and more persuasive essay. Good job!
