Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper based on the provided text. Here's a breakdown of strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles an important and relevant issue: the lack of adequate family responsibility policies in the United States compared to other developed nations. It's clear the writer has done some research and understands the complexities involved. However, the paper needs some refinement to strengthen its argument, improve its organization, and enhance its analytical depth.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Introduction:** The introduction effectively sets the stage by outlining the historical context of the feminist movement and its impact on women in the workforce. It clearly states the paper's thesis: that the omission of maternity and family responsibilities from early feminist discussions has led to inadequate policies in the US.
*   **Relevant Examples:** The paper provides specific examples of legal cases (e.g., Lopez v. Bimbo Bakeries, Back v. Hastings) that illustrate the challenges faced by employees dealing with family responsibilities.
*   **Good Use of Sources:** The paper cites relevant sources, including legal documents, news articles, and the WorkLife Law website, to support its claims.
*   **Addresses Counterarguments:** The paper acknowledges the concerns of employers regarding the cost of paid leave and attempts to address these concerns by mentioning the California model.
*   **Focus on Solution:** Examples are provided to discuss current policy examples and what should be changed to improve the problem.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Organization and Flow:** The paper sometimes lacks a clear and logical flow. The transitions between sections could be smoother, and the overall structure could be more coherent.
*   **Lack of deeper analysis:** There is a summary of court cases and current policies, but it would be enhanced with a deeper analysis of why these have been successful or unsuccessful.
*   **Argumentative Strength:** While the paper identifies the problem and provides some evidence, it could be more argumentative. It should actively persuade the reader, rather than simply presenting information.
*   **Depth of Analysis:** The analysis of the legal cases and the effectiveness of the current laws could be deeper. The paper could explore the underlying reasons for the lack of progress in the US and the cultural factors that contribute to the problem.
*   **Voice and Tone:** The tone is somewhat descriptive rather than analytical. A stronger voice would make the paper more engaging.

**Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Strengthen the Thesis Statement:**
    *   Make the thesis more specific and arguable. Instead of just stating the problem, argue a particular viewpoint about the causes, consequences, or potential solutions.

2.  **Improve Organization:**
    *   Consider using a more structured outline.
    *   Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence that introduces the main point.
    *   Use transition words and phrases to connect ideas and paragraphs smoothly.

3.  **Develop the Analysis:**
    *   For each legal case mentioned, analyze its significance in detail. How did the court rule? What were the legal precedents involved? What impact did the case have on family responsibility policies?
    *   Compare and contrast the different approaches to family leave in the US and other developed countries. What are the key differences? Why are these differences important?
    *   Explore the underlying cultural and political factors that contribute to the lack of progress in the US. What are the dominant attitudes towards work, family, and gender roles?
    *   Assess the effectiveness of the various anti-discrimination statutes mentioned in the paper. What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can they be improved?

4.  **Strengthen the Argument:**
    *   Present your argument more forcefully. Use persuasive language and rhetorical devices to convince the reader of your viewpoint.
    *   Anticipate and address potential counterarguments. For example, some argue that paid leave is bad for business. You could address this claim by citing research showing the benefits of paid leave for employee morale, productivity, and retention.
    *   Offer specific recommendations for policy changes. What types of laws or programs should the US adopt to improve family responsibility policies?

5.  **Enhance the Voice and Tone:**
    *   Use active voice more frequently to make your writing more direct and assertive.
    *   Express your own opinions and insights more clearly.
    *   Make the tone more analytical and less descriptive.

6.  **Refine the Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the main points of the paper.
    *   Reiterate the thesis statement in a new and compelling way.
    *   Offer a call to action. What should readers do to help address the problem?

7.  **Address the WorkLife Law Criticism:**
    *   I see the mention of questioning claims that are trying to be furthered. While it is a good point and critical, it should be a strong conclusion with how to further your side, rather than a criticism.
    *   Be sure to discuss the positive outcomes that come from this advocacy group, rather than focusing on the negative.

8.  **Proofread Carefully:**
    *   Proofread the paper carefully for any errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

By addressing these weaknesses and implementing these suggestions, you can significantly strengthen your paper and make it a more persuasive and insightful analysis of the challenges of family responsibility policies in the United States.
