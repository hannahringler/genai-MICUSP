Okay, I can provide some feedback on this paper. Here's a breakdown of its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement, focusing on argumentation, clarity, and sociological depth:

**Overall Impression**

The paper is a well-structured and thoughtful analysis of Mead, Goffman, and Garfinkel's theories on the self.  It demonstrates a good understanding of the core concepts and attempts to connect them.  The critique offered is valid and addresses a crucial limitation of these classical theories. However, the critique could be more strongly argued and substantiated with contemporary examples.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper follows a logical flow, introducing the key theorists, summarizing their ideas, and then offering a critique.
*   **Good Summaries:** The summaries of Mead, Goffman, and Garfinkel are accurate and concise. You've captured the essential aspects of their theories.
*   **Identifies a Key Weakness:** The paper correctly identifies the limitations of these theories in accounting for diversity, power dynamics, and individual agency in contemporary society.
*   **Uses Quotes Effectively:**  The use of direct quotes from the theorists strengthens the analysis and demonstrates a familiarity with the original texts.
*   **Well-written**: The paper is well-written and uses good vocabulary.

**Weaknesses & Suggestions**

1.  **Strengthen the Argument/Critique:**

    *   **Specificity:** While you identify a valid weakness (lack of accounting for diversity and power), the critique is somewhat general. Make it *more specific*. How *exactly* do these theories fall short? What *specific* aspects of 21st-century society are they unable to explain adequately?
    *   **Evidence & Examples:** The critique would be *much* stronger with concrete examples. For instance:
        *   **Mead:**  Illustrate how Mead's concept of the "generalized other" might not adequately account for individuals navigating multiple, conflicting social groups with vastly different values. For example, a person from a marginalized group constantly having to perform to "fit in" with more dominant groups while maintaining the authenticity of their own culture.
        *   **Goffman:**  Show how Goffman's dramaturgical approach might not fully capture the experiences of individuals who face systematic discrimination and microaggressions that constantly challenge their self-presentation, requiring them to expend more emotional labor than others. How does the "backstage" and "front stage" differ for an immigrant or a person with disabilities?
        *   **Garfinkel:** Explain how focusing on "accountability" can be problematic in societies with widespread structural inequalities, where certain groups are held to different standards or face constant scrutiny.
    *   **Develop the Argument about Agency:**  Expand on the limited agency point. How do structures of power limit agency and influence self-perception? It is good to make the point but it needs to be tied to examples.

2.  **Deepen Sociological Analysis:**

    *   **Connect to Broader Sociological Concepts:**  Explicitly connect the critique to broader sociological concepts like:
        *   **Intersectionality:**  The concept is briefly mentioned, but could be used more thoroughly. Apply it to your examples.  How do race, class, gender, and other social categories *intersect* to shape the self in ways that these classical theories don't fully address?
        *   **Social Stratification:** Explicitly discuss how social stratification and inequalities of power influence self-development, self-presentation, and the construction of social reality.
        *   **Cultural Capital:**  How does cultural capital influence the ability to perform on the "front stage"?
    *   **Acknowledge Nuance**: While criticizing, acknowledge where the original theory provides a useful foundation. Don't portray as entirely useless.

3.  **Refine Thesis Statement/Concluding Remarks:**

    *   The ending sentence is good. It captures the bi-directional aspect of self and society but needs to be refined. The thesis statement should do a better job of pointing towards the paper's analytical focus.
    *  Incorporate agency more into the discussion to offer a better understanding of the complexities of self-identity.

**Specific Line-by-Line Comments/Suggestions:**

*   **Page 1:** "...is that it seeks to remedy the indexical properties of members' talk and conduct" (244). These indexical properties can be defined as any thing that helps sociologists examine the human social experience between and within individuals. **[Suggestion: Rephrase the second sentence. It doesn't quite capture the complexity of "indexicality."  Instead, say something like: "These indexical properties refer to the way meaning is always context-dependent and situated within specific social interactions." ]**

*   **Page 2:** "By subjective, I mean the part of the self that is more internalized..." **[Suggestion: This is a good clarification. However, consider rephrasing the next sentence to better explain the subjectivity of the self. ]**

*   **Page 3:** Dramaturgy Quote. **[Consider paraphrasing this quote to better capture the meaning of the expression rather than cutting and pasting. ]**

*   **Page 4:** "...when an individual appears in the presence of others, there will usually be some reason for him to mobilize his activity so that it will convey an impression to others which it is in his interests to convey” (4). **[Suggestion: This is a good quote, but follow it with a sentence that explicitly states why it is important or what it means. The connection to power or diversity can be established here.]**

*   **Page 6:** Example. **[Good connection with identity. However, consider expanding on the ways social institutions such as schools or employment affect the self-identity of individuals.]**

*   **Page 8:** “The individual possesses a self only in relation to the selves of the other members of his social group...”. **[Suggestion: After the quote, you say "While group membership provides the social capacity..."  This is a good start, but you need to go further in showing how this dynamic can be *limiting* and how power operates here.]**

*   **Page 9:** Another component of symbolic interactionism... **[Suggestion: Good connection to power. Consider expanding on the ways certain people have to alter themselves to perform.]**

**In Summary**

This is a solid paper with a good foundation. By strengthening the argument with more specific examples, deepening the sociological analysis, and refining the thesis/conclusion, you can elevate it to a truly excellent piece. Remember to explicitly demonstrate *how* the theories are insufficient for understanding the complexities of self and society in the 21st century.
