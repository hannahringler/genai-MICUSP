Here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impressions**

The paper presents an interesting thesis: that Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* and H.G. Wells' *The Time Machine* use vegetarianism as a symbol of humanitarianism and a call for moral responsibility.  The paper shows promise in developing this idea, but needs further refinement and support to be fully convincing.

**Strengths**

*   **Interesting Thesis:** The core argument is thought-provoking and offers a fresh perspective on two well-known novels.
*   **Good Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, introducing the topic, examining each novel, and concluding.
*   **Engagement with Texts:** The paper refers to specific passages from the novels to support its claims.
*   **Awareness of Authorial Context:** The paper mentions Shelley and Wells' personal involvement with vegetarianism.
*   **Clear Writing Style:** The paper is generally written in a clear and understandable style.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Deeper Analysis of 'Vegetarianism' as a Symbol:**
    *   **Definition:** The paper assumes a shared understanding of "vegetarianism" as a symbol. You need to unpack *what* this symbol means to Shelley and Wells. What specific qualities of vegetarianism are they trying to associate with humanitarianism? Is it about compassion, respect for nature, simplicity, or something else?
    *   **Elaboration:** Connect the dots more explicitly.  Show, don't just tell, how specific instances of vegetarianism in the novels relate to the larger theme of humanitarianism.
*   **Strengthening Evidence and Argumentation:**
    *   **Eloi and Vegetarianism:** The assertion that the Eloi's vegetarianism connects to humanitarianism is weak. You mention their lack of empathy. How does that contrast with their vegetarianism? The paper needs to either make a stronger connection, or acknowledge the contradiction and explain why it exists within the context of Wells's message.
    *   **The Creature's Motivation:** Explore the Creature's motivation for vegetarianism in more detail. Is it purely ethical, or are there practical reasons given his isolation and physical condition?
    *   **Counterarguments:** Acknowledge potential counterarguments. For example, one could argue that the Creature's violence undermines any potential humanitarian message. Address these points to strengthen your overall argument.
*   **Specificity:** The paper often makes broad statements that need to be supported with more specific examples and analysis.
*   **Development:** Make sure all of the points are thoroughly expanded. For example, you mentioned that "From a production standpoint, it is much more efficient to produce vegetation than meat as the quantity of resources spent feeding and raising animals devastate the environment." This is an interesting point, but needs further development.
*   **Clarity and Flow:**
    *   **Transitions:** Improve the transitions between paragraphs and ideas to create a smoother flow of argument.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Vary sentence structure for better readability.
*   **Proofreading:** Carefully proofread for any typos or grammatical errors.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Strengthen the hook. The opening questions are a bit generic. Start with a more specific observation about the novels.
    *   Clearly state your thesis.
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that directly relates to your thesis.
    *   Provide specific examples and textual evidence to support your claims.
    *   Analyze the examples in detail, explaining *how* they support your argument.
    *   Explain the *significance* of your analysis. Why does it matter? What does it reveal about the novel?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize your main points.
    *   Reiterate your thesis.
    *   Offer a final thought or insight.

**Revised Snippets**

Here are a few examples of how you could revise certain sections:

*   **Original:** "Shelley's Creature and Wells's Eloi share their differences, however are connected by their vegetarian diet."
    *   **Revised:** "While the Creature and the Eloi differ significantly in their circumstances and motivations, their shared vegetarianism functions as a crucial link, highlighting the authors' advocacy for a more compassionate and ecologically aware society."
*   **Original:** "Wells furthers this argument in contrasting Eloi's vegetarianism with the carnivorous Morlocks, whom, the TT eventually discovers, tend to Eloi for the same reasons as a farmer tends to cattle."
    *   **Revised:** "Wells sharply contrasts the Eloi's seemingly peaceful vegetarianism with the Morlocks' predatory carnivorism. The Time Traveler's realization that the Morlocks 'tend' to the Eloi, treating them as livestock, serves as a disturbing metaphor for the human exploitation of animals for food, thereby questioning the true nature of the Eloi's 'humanitarian' diet."

**Next Steps**

1.  **Revise your thesis.**
2.  **Re-examine the novels.**
3.  **Strengthen your evidence and analysis.**
4.  **Refine the organization and flow of the paper.**

By addressing these areas, you can significantly strengthen your argument and create a more compelling and persuasive paper. Good luck!
