Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The paper is a thoughtful exploration of the nature of truth, reality, and the role of science and personal belief systems in shaping our perceptions.  It demonstrates a good grasp of complex philosophical ideas and an ability to connect them to personal experiences and academic studies. The writing is generally clear and well-organized, and the paper shows a genuine effort to grapple with these difficult concepts.

**Strengths**

*   **Thoughtful Exploration:** The paper tackles complex philosophical questions about the nature of reality, truth, and objectivity. You demonstrate a willingness to engage with these ideas in a meaningful way.
*   **Personal Connection:** You effectively integrate your personal experiences (being Christian, a biopsychology major) into the discussion, making the paper more engaging and demonstrating the impact of these factors on your worldview.
*   **Use of Examples:** The example of the football game study is well-chosen and illustrates the concept of subjective perception effectively. The reference to *The Matrix* is also a good way to introduce and relate to the concept of reality as interpreted by the brain.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper has a logical flow, moving from general questions about truth to your personal beliefs, the role of science, and a final conclusion.
*   **Acknowledging Complexity:** You acknowledge the nuances and complexities of these issues, avoiding simplistic or dogmatic statements. You show an understanding that there are varying positions and degrees within those positions.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Clarity and Precision:** While generally clear, some sentences and paragraphs could benefit from greater precision. At times, the arguments could be more sharply defined.

*   **Development of Arguments:** While the paper raises interesting points, some arguments could be developed more thoroughly.

*   **Counterarguments/Nuance:** You mention some criticisms of scientism and the scientific method. You could strengthen the paper by exploring these criticisms in more detail or by explicitly addressing counterarguments to your own positions.

*   **Deeper Analysis of Sources:** The paper cites a few sources. You could delve deeper into the content and relevance of these sources, analyzing their arguments and connecting them more explicitly to your own.

**Specific Suggestions**

1.  **Define Key Terms:** In the introduction, consider providing brief definitions of key terms like "truth," "reality," and "objectivity" as you intend to use them in the paper. This will help to ground the discussion and avoid potential ambiguities.

2.  **Elaborate on the Influence of Christianity:** You state that being Christian greatly affects your ideas about truth and reality. Elaborate on *how* this is the case. What specific Christian beliefs influence your perspective on objectivity, subjectivity, or the nature of truth?

3.  **Expand on the "Deification of Science":** You mention that your schooling "somewhat deifies the powers of science." Provide specific examples of how this manifests in your education. Are there particular approaches to teaching science or messages conveyed that contribute to this view?

4.  **Strengthen the Football Game Argument:** The football game example is good, but you could strengthen it by:

    *   Explicitly stating the key findings of the Hastorf and Cantril study.
    *   Analyzing *why* people perceived the game differently (e.g., group identification, prior beliefs, emotional investment).
    *   Connecting the example more directly to your central argument about constructivism.

5.  **Develop the Critique of Scientism:** When you state you believe in scientism, explain what you mean by that.  Then, when you say there are "problems with the scientific method," be more specific. What are those problems? How do they relate to your overall argument about the subjective nature of perception? What are the limitations of trying to reproduce the "real world" in a lab? What does that inability say about the truth of the lab results?

6.  **Clarify the Intuitionism Argument:** Explain more fully what Intuitionism is. What specific claims do proponents of Verstehen hypothesis make about knowledge that can be gained through introspection and intuition? You clearly disagree with this, so make sure you fairly represent it before you critique it.

7.  **Address Counterarguments:** Consider addressing potential counterarguments to your claims. For example, if you argue that objectivity is impossible, acknowledge that some people might argue that certain scientific methods or logical frameworks can minimize bias and provide relatively objective knowledge.

8.  **Conclusion - Stronger Takeaway:** The conclusion is good, but you could strengthen it by summarizing your main points and offering a more definitive takeaway message. What is the overall significance of your exploration of these issues? What have you learned about the nature of truth and reality?

**Example Revisions**

Here are a few examples of how you could revise specific sentences:

*   **Original:** "This first question of what is reality is one that can never be answered, and yet at the same time is it one that one can not help asking."
    *   **Revised:** "The fundamental question of the nature of reality may ultimately be unanswerable, yet it remains a persistent and compelling inquiry."

*   **Original:** "My science background inclines me to believe in this scientism as well."
    *   **Revised:** "My scientific training has instilled in me a belief in scientism, the view that the scientific method is the most reliable path to knowledge."

**In summary:** Your paper is a promising start. By focusing on clarifying your arguments, developing your points with more detail, and engaging with potential counterarguments, you can elevate it to an even higher level. Good luck!
