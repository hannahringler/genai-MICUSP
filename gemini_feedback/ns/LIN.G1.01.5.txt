Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper.  Here's a breakdown, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a well-structured and detailed account of a research project, its challenges, and its (lack of) success.  It demonstrates a good understanding of linguistic concepts related to stress, vowel quality, and experimental design. The author is clearly reflective and critical of their own work, which is a strong quality in research. However, the paper can be improved to be more concise, clear and convincing.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem Statement:** The paper clearly identifies the research question: can pitch alone shift perceived stress in Vlach?
*   **Detailed Methodology:** The experimental design is described in detail, including how the author attempted to control for other variables (vowel quality, intensity, duration). The figures showing the pitch contour scheme and vowel formants are helpful.
*   **Critical Self-Analysis:** The author doesn't shy away from admitting the experiment's failure and critically examines the possible reasons for the failure. This is a sign of intellectual honesty and a willingness to learn from mistakes.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions), making it relatively easy to follow.
*   **Understanding of Linguistic Concepts:** The author demonstrates a good grasp of the relevant linguistic concepts, like stress, vowel quality, formants, and pitch.
*   **Appendix:** Providing the raw response data in the appendix is very useful for readers who want to examine the results more closely.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Length and Redundancy:** The paper can be more concise. There are instances of repetition and over-explanation. For example, the motivation and assumption sections could be streamlined.
*   **Justification of Choices:** Some design choices are not fully justified or are justified weakly.
    *   Why was *only* one participant used? This is a major limitation that needs stronger acknowledgement in the introduction and discussion.
    *   The statistical insignificance of duration difference is also not really convincing.
*   **Negative Framing:** The tone of the paper is somewhat negative, focusing on the *failure* of the experiment. It would be better to frame it as a learning experience and emphasize what was learned from the experiment, even though the hypothesis was not supported.
*   **Limited Scope of Future Directions:** The conclusion is a little weak. While the author mentions the need for more speakers, they could be more specific about potential improvements to the design based on the insights gained.
*   **Clarity in Results Discussion:** While the author reflects on the listener's comments, the connection to the data isn't always explicit. It is a bit confusing if there is an "error" in the results section.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Condense and Focus:**
    *   **Introduction:** Get to the point more quickly. Summarize the previous project more briefly and state the hypothesis and aims of this experiment directly.
    *   **Methods:** Be more economical with wording. Cut out redundant phrases and sentences.
    *   **Motivations and Assumptions:** Streamline this section. Focus on the core assumptions and why they might be problematic.
2.  **Strengthen Justifications:**
    *   **One Participant:** Acknowledge the major limitation of having only one participant more prominently and discuss its potential impact on the results. Mention why it was unavoidable and what steps might mitigate this in future research (e.g., running the experiment multiple times with the same participant, even though it's less ideal than multiple participants). Discuss how that might affect results.
    *   **Choice of Tokens:** Provide a more compelling reason for selecting token 16 as the base.
    *   **Justify duration decisions:** Consider re-analyzing the duration data from Project 4. If you could calculate a more accurate midpoint value, justify this decision in the paper.
3.  **Reframe the Narrative:**
    *   Instead of emphasizing failure, highlight what was learned. The experiment may not have confirmed the hypothesis, but it provided valuable insights into the complexity of stress perception in Vlach and the challenges of isolating variables.
    *   Focus on the aspects that "worked" â€“ even if it was only partially. Mention that some of the tokens were judged as hypothesized and mention this in the abstract.
4.  **Expand on Future Directions:**
    *   Be more specific about how the experiment could be improved. For example:
        *   "Future research should focus on..."
        *   "A promising avenue for further investigation would be..."
        *   "This experiment highlights the need for..."
        *   More detailed analysis of pitch contours
5.  **Clarify Results Analysis:**
    *   Connect the participant's comments more directly to specific data points or patterns in the results.
    *   If a response in the data is an "error" then either correct the error or explain more clearly why you are not doing so.
6.  **Proofread Carefully:** Look for any remaining typos or grammatical errors.

**Specific Examples of Edits:**

*   **Original:** "This paper is an attempt to find the weakness in this experiment so that future experiments might be carried out with better success."
*   **Revised:** "This paper analyzes the shortcomings of this experiment to inform the design of future research on stress perception in Vlach."

*   **Original:** "The assumption is that there exists (in principle) a token that is neutral in terms of stress for all variables."
*   **Revised:** "This experiment relies on the assumption that a 'neutral' token exists, exhibiting no inherent stress due to vowel quality, intensity, or duration."

*   **In Conclusions, instead of:** "To be entirely honest, this experiment may have had design flaws that arose from its hasty preparation."
*   **Try:** "Although this experiment did not confirm the initial hypothesis, it revealed critical insights into the factors influencing stress perception in Vlach, and limitations of this methodology. Future research should focus on addressing these issues through..." (and then elaborate).

**In Summary**

This is a good start to a research paper. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above and focusing on a more positive and forward-looking narrative, you can significantly strengthen the paper and make it more impactful. Good luck!
