Here's some feedback on the paper, covering its strengths and areas for potential improvement:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Organization:** The paper establishes its focus on three books examining African American women in popular performance and maintains a consistent structure, comparing and contrasting the approaches, arguments, and methodologies of each.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The review covers a good range of key points from each book, providing summaries of their main arguments, methodologies, and contributions to the field.
*   **Critical Engagement:** The review doesn't just summarize but engages critically with the arguments of the books, identifying strengths and weaknesses. The author demonstrates an ability to assess the significance and limitations of each work.
*   **Strong Use of Evidence:** The paper effectively uses direct quotes and page numbers to support its interpretations of the books.
*   **Scholarly Tone:** The writing is formal and appropriate for a graduate-level paper, using sophisticated vocabulary and avoiding overly casual language.
*   **Insightful Connections:** The author effectively draws connections between the three books and wider historical and theoretical contexts. For instance, the discussion of respectability, the Harlem Renaissance, and the influence of transnational movements are well-integrated.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Original Argument:** While the paper effectively summarizes and compares the books, it could benefit from a stronger original argument. The review could offer a more assertive thesis statement that goes beyond simply summarizing the books. This overarching argument can discuss the contribution to historiography. How does the field benefit from the reviewed works?
*   **Deeper Analysis:** While the paper does offer some critical analysis, there are opportunities for greater depth. For example, the discussion of "ordinary vs. extraordinary" women could be further explored. What does this distinction mean in the context of these performances, and what are the implications of focusing on either type of woman?
*   **Nuance:** The paper could be more nuanced in its assessments. For instance, the critique that Brown's book tries to do too much could be tempered by acknowledging the benefits of her ambitious scope.
*   **Engagement with Secondary Literature:** While the paper references some secondary sources, it could benefit from a more explicit engagement with the broader scholarly conversation on African American women's history, performance studies, or cultural history. This would help to contextualize the significance of the reviewed books and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the field.
*   **Clarity in Connections:** At times, the connections between the books could be made more explicit. A clearer articulation of the overarching themes or debates that tie the books together would strengthen the overall argument.
*   **Specificity in Critique:** When critiquing a book, try to provide more specific examples. For example, in the critique that "Brown's study occasionally feels as though it's trying to accomplish too much at once," provide a concrete example of where this breadth weakens the argument.
*   **Consider the Audience:** While scholarly, the review could be written in a way that is engaging to the reader.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Refine the Introduction:** Strengthen the introduction by making the thesis statement more explicit. What is the key takeaway or central argument you want the reader to understand about these books and their contribution to the field?
*   **Address the "So What?" Question:** Be sure to clearly articulate why these books matter. What are the broader implications of their findings? How do they challenge or expand existing understandings of African American history, gender, or performance studies?
*   **Synthesize Arguments:** Look for opportunities to synthesize the arguments of the three books. Are there areas of agreement or disagreement that can be highlighted to create a more coherent narrative?
*   **Elaborate on the Authors' Choices:** When discussing the authors' methodological choices, consider exploring the reasons behind those choices. Why did they choose certain theoretical frameworks or focus on specific aspects of their subjects' lives?
*   **Conclusion:** Ensure the conclusion goes beyond summarizing the content. In which way is it hoped the reader acts after reading this review?

**In summary:**

The paper is a solid graduate-level review that demonstrates a strong grasp of the material. The author effectively summarizes and compares the three books, offering insightful observations and critical assessments. With some revisions to strengthen the original argument, deepen the analysis, and more explicitly engage with secondary literature, the paper could be even more compelling and impactful.
