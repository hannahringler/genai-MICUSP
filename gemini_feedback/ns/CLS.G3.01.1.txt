Okay, I can definitely help you with feedback on this paper! To give you the *most* helpful feedback, it would be ideal if you could tell me:

*   **What kind of feedback are you looking for?** (e.g., "Is the argument clear?", "Is the writing style appropriate?", "Are there any major flaws in the research?", "Is the paper well-organized?", "Are my sources reliable?", etc.)  The more specific you are, the more targeted my feedback can be.
*   **What is the context of this paper?** (e.g., "It's for a graduate-level seminar on ancient magic," "It's a draft of a chapter for my dissertation," "It's just for practice," etc.)
*   **What are your main concerns about the paper?**

However, even without that, I can provide some general feedback:

**Overall Impressions (Based on a Quick Scan)**

*   **Interesting Topic:** The intersection of violence, sexuality, magic, and the role of spirits in Greco-Roman Egypt is fascinating and potentially very rich.
*   **Impressive Scope:**  You're tackling a complex issue and drawing on a good range of primary (PGM, *Supplementum Magicum*) and secondary sources.
*   **Dense and Academic:**  The writing style is definitely academic, and at times quite dense. This might be appropriate for the intended audience, but it could also benefit from some simplification in certain areas.
*   **Well-Structured:**  The overall argument appears to be well structured, the logical flow of the paper is good, from initial discussion about the individuals involved, to violence at the target, coercion of the daimon and finally the conclusion.
*   **Good Use of Visuals:** A visual presentation of the logical flow of the paper through a diagram helps understanding the main points.

**Areas for Potential Improvement (General Suggestions)**

1.  **Clarity of Argument:**
    *   Make sure the core thesis is exceptionally clear and reiterated throughout. While the topic is engaging, sometimes the specific argumentative thread can get a bit lost in the details.
    *   The conclusion could more forcefully summarize *how* your analysis of the *nekudaimones* specifically illuminates the violent/sexual language of the spells in relation to the relative status of the participants.
2.  **Accessibility of Writing:**
    *   Consider breaking up very long paragraphs.
    *   Simplify sentence structure where possible, especially in the more densely worded sections.
    *   While using specialized terminology is necessary, be sure to define terms clearly, especially when you first introduce them. Assume your audience has a good background, but might not be *intimately* familiar with every term.
3.  **Strengthening the Analysis:**
    *   **More Concrete Examples:** While you cite PGM spells frequently, consider providing even *more* detailed examples, perhaps even translating key phrases, to really ground your analysis. Spend some more time unpacking the implications of particular phrases or actions within the spells.
    *   **Addressing Counterarguments:**  Consider briefly addressing alternative interpretations or potential criticisms of your argument.  For example, could someone argue that the violence *is* simply a reflection of societal views on women, and your *nekudaimon* argument is less relevant?
4.  **Refining the Conclusion:**
    *   Make the connection between your analysis and the larger implications of your argument even clearer. Why does this matter? What does it tell us about Greco-Roman magic, society, or religion? How could your work contribute to broader scholarly conversations?

**Specific Questions That Arise:**

*   **Who is your intended audience?** Is this for other experts in ancient magic, or a broader audience interested in the history of religion or social structures?
*   **What does the diagram represent?** The diagram is helpful, but I'd suggest labelling its constituent parts for clarity and linking it more explicitly to the text.
*   The frequent use of untranslated Ancient Greek quotes can be disruptive to readers who cannot understand them.

**Next Steps**

1.  **Clarify Your Goals:**  Decide what you want to achieve with this paper and what kind of feedback is most important to you.
2.  **Review for Clarity:**  Reread the paper with a critical eye, focusing on whether the argument is easy to follow and whether the writing is as clear and concise as possible.
3.  **Seek Specific Feedback:**  Ask specific questions of your peers or advisor about the areas you're most concerned about.

I hope this general feedback is helpful!  Please let me know if you have any more specific questions or requests. Good luck with your paper!
