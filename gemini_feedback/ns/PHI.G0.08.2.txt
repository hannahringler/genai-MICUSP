Okay, I've read the paper and can provide feedback. Here's a breakdown of strengths and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of reliabilism and attempts to address a specific counterexample.  The writing is generally clear and organized. However, the paper could benefit from more direct engagement with Goldman's actual arguments and a more rigorous exploration of the proposed modification.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Explanation of Reliabilism:** The paper provides a reasonable summary of Goldman's reliabilism, including the distinction between reliable and unreliable processes, and the difference between belief-independent and belief-dependent processes.
*   **Well-Defined Counterexample:** The "Confused" example is clearly presented and highlights a potential problem for standard reliabilism.
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure: introduction to reliabilism, presentation of a counterexample, and a proposed solution.
*   **Clear Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Engagement with Goldman:**
    *   **Specificity:** The paper relies on very general statements about what Goldman argues and only cites page numbers. You need to refer to his specific arguments and terminology. For example, does Goldman address cases where a belief-forming process is accidentally reliable? Does he have a concept of "defeaters" that might be relevant?
    *   **Nuance:** Reliabilism has been refined over time. Is the paper addressing a specific version of Goldman's theory? Consider mentioning process reliabilism vs. virtue reliabilism (if relevant) or addressing the issue of generality of the process.
*   **Analysis of the Counterexample:**
    *   **Justification:** More needs to be said about why the counterexample truly demonstrates knowledge without justification. Is "Confused's" belief really knowledge? Could one argue that under those specific circumstances, the belief *is* justified, even if accidentally?
    *   **Alternative Interpretations:** Does Goldman address cases where a process produces true beliefs *because* of an unusual circumstance? Does he insist on the idea of reliable *general* processes, not just those that are reliable in one specific case?
*   **Proposed Modification:**
    *   **Justification for the Exception:** The paper proposes an exception for 100% reliable belief-independent processes. Why *this* exception? What's the underlying principle? It seems ad-hoc.
    *   **Consequences of the Modification:** What are the implications of this modification? Does it create new problems? Does it conflict with the core tenets of reliabilism? Does it open the door to other counterexamples?
    *   **Clarity of the Modification:** The wording of the amended clause ("Otherwise, if we are using a 100% reliable process, we can have knowledge without previous justification”) is unclear.  How do we *know* we are using a 100% reliable process *before* we have justification? This seems to defeat the purpose.
*   **Lack of Citations:** The lack of citations other than Feldman (for basic explanation) hurts the paper. You need to be referencing primary sources that give rise to the debate in epistemology.
*   **Clarification of terminology.** Throughout the paper, it is unclear that the terminology in the quotes is from Goldman or Feldman.

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Strengthen the Introduction:** Briefly introduce reliabilism and *explicitly state the paper's thesis* (e.g., "This paper will argue that a specific counterexample reveals a limitation in Goldman's reliabilism and propose a modification to address it.").

2.  **Provide More Context for the Counterexample:** Explain why the "Confused" example is considered a standard objection. Refer to the philosophical literature where similar examples are discussed.

3.  **Address Potential Objections to Your Proposed Solution:** Anticipate and address potential criticisms of your modified clause. For example, someone might argue that it undermines the fundamental spirit of reliabilism.

4.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the main points, reiterate the revised account, and briefly suggest further research or implications.

**Revised Excerpt Example (Focusing on engagement with Goldman):**

Instead of:

> Alvin Goldman, the original proponent of reliabilism, starts its explanation by discussing what does not give us knowledge. After describing several processes that cause us to obtain faulty beliefs, Alvin Goldman says, “What do these faulty processes have in common? They share the feature of unreliability; they tend to produce error a large portion of the time” (1).

Try something like:

> Alvin Goldman, in his seminal work "What is Justified Belief?" (Goldman, 1979), argues that justified belief, and consequently knowledge, is primarily a function of the reliability of the cognitive processes that produce it. He contrasts reliable processes, like perception under normal conditions, with unreliable processes, such as wishful thinking or guessing. Goldman explicitly states that "*processes that frequently lead to false beliefs are unreliable*" (Goldman, 1979, p. XX), establishing a direct link between process reliability and justification. However, [state your claim or paper direction based on this more thorough introduction].

**In Summary:**

This is a good start, but needs more in-depth analysis of the theory and of your proposed solution. By engaging more directly with the relevant literature and strengthening the arguments for your modification, you can elevate this paper to a higher level. Good luck!
