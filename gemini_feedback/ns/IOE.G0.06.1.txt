Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper based on the OCR text you've provided.  I'll focus on areas where the writing, structure, and analysis could be improved, assuming this is a business/organizational analysis.  I'll also point out strengths.

**Overall Impressions (Based on OCR Text)**

*   **Good Start, but Needs More Depth:** The paper seems to lay a decent foundation for an external analysis of NSBE. It identifies key environmental factors and discusses some strategic responses. However, it often lacks depth and critical evaluation. It leans toward description rather than analysis.
*   **Structure is Generally Sound:** The organization is logical, following a typical framework for external analysis (environment, mission, strategy, etc.).
*   **Clarity Varies:** Some sections are clear and concise, while others are a bit vague or repetitive.
*   **Needs More Evidence/Support:** Claims are often made without sufficient evidence or specific examples.

**Specific Feedback by Section**

**Executive Summary:**

*   **Good Overview:** The summary provides a decent snapshot of the analysis.
*   **Consider Quantifiable Results:** If possible, quantify some of the key findings or achievements.

**Boundary:**

*   **Clear Definition:** This section clearly defines the scope of the organization.

**Key Inputs:**

*   **Good Identification of Inputs:** Identifying inputs like "black engineers," corporate funding, and E-board efforts is valuable.
*   **Elaborate on Interdependencies:** Discuss how these inputs relate to and influence each other. For example, how does corporate funding impact the recruitment or development of black engineers?

**History:**

*   **Provides Context:** The historical background is helpful.

**External Environment:**

*   **Good Identification, but Needs Analysis:** Identifying the market, financial resources, human services, and government sectors is a good start. BUT, analyze each sector more deeply:
    *   **Market:** How is the market for engineering students changing? What are the trends in student demographics?
    *   **Financial Resources:** How reliant is NSBE on specific sponsors? What are the potential risks if funding sources dry up?
    *   **Human Services:** Why are the E-board positions going uncontested? Is there a lack of interest? Burnout? Poor recruitment for leadership roles? What can be done to address this?
    *   **Government:** The discussion of affirmative action is relevant. Elaborate on the potential impact and what NSBE can do to mitigate negative effects.
*   **Simple/Unstable Environment Classification:** Justifying this classification is essential. More evidence is needed. How *specifically* do the changing student needs make the environment unstable?
*   **Organic Structure:** Connect the organic structure more directly to the unstable environment. How does the teamwork-oriented structure enable NSBE to adapt?

**Future Environmental Trends:**

*   **Good Identification of Trends:** The discussion of technology and public perception is good.
*   **Elaborate on Strategic Implications:** How can NSBE *proactively* leverage technology trends? What specific strategies can be implemented to combat negative perceptions or low black engineer admissions?

**Mission and Strategy:**

*   **Clear Mission Statement:** Stating the mission is fundamental.
*   **Connect Mission to Action:** Link the mission statement *directly* to the goals and programs. How does each program support academic success, professional development, or community impact?
*   **Statistical Context:** The retention rate statistic is powerful. Use it to build a stronger argument for NSBE's importance.
*   **Analyzer Strategy Justification:** Expand on why "analyzer" is the right fit. How does NSBE balance maintaining current members with attracting new ones and fostering innovation?

**Goals and Objectives:**

*   **Specific Goals Are Good:** Having specific goals (e.g., 200 active members, increased GPA) is positive.
*   **Make Goals SMARTer:** While the goals are relatively specific, consider making them even more:
    *   **Measurable:** How will "active members" be *precisely* measured?
    *   **Achievable:** Are these goals realistic given the current environment?
    *   **Relevant:** How directly do these goals contribute to the mission?
    *   **Time-bound:** Over what timeframe will these goals be achieved?
*   **Prioritize Goals:** Are some goals more critical than others?
*   **Action Plans Should Be Specific:** For example, the steps that are being taken to accomplish a certain goal must be explained in detail.

**Outputs:**

*   **Relate outputs back to Key Inputs:** In this section, it's important to relate the success of output back to the level of input that's being put in (Corporate sponsors, volunteers, etc.)

**Differences Between Desired and Actual Outputs:**

*   **Lack of Attendance and Involvement:** This is a key issue to address. Explore the *reasons* for low attendance. Is it a lack of awareness? Conflicting schedules? Irrelevant programs?
*   **Internship Availability:** Acknowledge the external factors, but focus on what NSBE *can* control (e.g., resume workshops, networking events, interview preparation).
*   **Graduate Student Involvement:** This is another critical challenge. Conduct targeted surveys to understand why graduate students are disengaged. Offer programs that cater to their specific needs (e.g., research opportunities, mentoring, networking with advanced professionals).

**Environmental Sensitivity:**

*   **Good Use of Surveys:** Using surveys to gather feedback is excellent.
*   **Close the Loop:** How is the survey data *actually* used to improve programs? Provide specific examples of changes that were implemented based on survey results.

**Conclusion:**

*   **Summarize Key Findings:** Restate the main points of the analysis.
*   **Offer Recommendations:** Based on your analysis, what *specific actions* should NSBE take to improve its effectiveness, address challenges, and capitalize on opportunities? This is where you provide value beyond just describing the situation.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Use More Specific Examples:** Instead of general statements, provide concrete examples to illustrate your points.
*   **Cite Sources (If Applicable):** If you're drawing on external research, cite your sources properly.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Correct any grammar or spelling errors.
*   **Consider a SWOT Analysis:** Summarizing the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats facing NSBE can provide a concise overview and guide strategic recommendations.

**Strengths of the Paper:**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper follows a logical flow.
*   **Identification of Key Factors:** You've identified many of the important environmental factors and strategic considerations.
*   **Awareness of Challenges:** You're aware of the key challenges facing NSBE (e.g., low attendance, graduate student disengagement).

**In summary, focus on adding more depth, critical analysis, specific examples, and actionable recommendations to elevate the quality of your paper.**
