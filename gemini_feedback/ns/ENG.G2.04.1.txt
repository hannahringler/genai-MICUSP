Okay, here's some feedback on your paper. Overall, it's a well-written and insightful analysis of Augusta Webster's "A Painter." You demonstrate a strong understanding of the poem and engage effectively with Angela Leighton's critical perspective.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis:** You present a clear and arguable thesis: that the painter's idealization of Ruth functions to deflect blame for his artistic failures and that the poem itself ironizes the painter's perspective.
*   **Close Reading:** You engage in close reading of the poem, paying attention to specific language, imagery, and rhetorical devices. You effectively use quotations to support your claims.
*   **Engagement with Criticism:** You directly address and critique Leighton's argument, offering a nuanced counter-reading of the poem. You don't simply dismiss her analysis but acknowledge its validity while offering a more complex interpretation.
*   **Sophisticated Argument:** Your argument is well-developed and logical. You build your case carefully, analyzing the painter's romanticization of Ruth, his veiled accusations, and the poem's overall structure.
*   **Clarity and Style:** Your writing is generally clear and well-organized. You use sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures, but your prose remains accessible.
*   **Use of Evidence:** You use evidence well to back your claims.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Nuance and Complexity of Leighton's argument:** While you effectively critique Leighton, consider digging deeper into *why* she might have focused on the social constraints and the painter's sympathy. Acknowledge potential validity for her perspective. Is it possible she is considering other of Webster's poems and how this interpretation fits with her larger body of work?
*   **Explore Ruth's Silence More Deeply:** Consider a deeper exploration of Ruth's silence. You argue that it allows the painter to project his own desires and anxieties onto her. Could her silence also be a form of resistance or a reflection of the limited options available to women in that era? Does the text suggest the possibility for a female author to be critical of this position?
*   **Consider Alternative Interpretations:** You could strengthen your argument by acknowledging and addressing alternative interpretations of the poem. Are there readings that might emphasize the painter's genuine love for Ruth or that focus on the societal pressures that affect both of them? Acknowledging these possibilities and then explaining why your reading is more persuasive would add depth to your analysis.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Page 1:** Consider simplifying the wording here: "Where exactly those hopes level off, however, is an issue that the poem takes up relentlessly." Maybe: "The extent of those hopes, however, is an issue that the poem examines."
*   **Page 2:** In the sentence beginning "Despite these apparently 'humble' professions..." it would be useful to explicitly state *how* Ruth enables the painter to evoke the compassion of the auditor and reader.
*   **Page 3:** Instead of describing Webster's poem as ultimately offering a comment on the validity of its speaker's societal critique by ironizing the painter's transparent idealism of Ruth, the poem could be said to "critique the validity" of his argument.
*   **Page 4:** Explore the potential for misinterpreting Ruth's motivations. How can misreading serve the speaker's purposes and enable him to construct and sustain an argument that may be more persuasive to himself?
*   **Page 7:** Consider delving further into the potential ambiguity of the phrase "then love, then".

**Overall:**

This is a very strong paper that demonstrates a clear understanding of the poem and a sophisticated critical approach. By addressing the suggestions above, you can further refine your analysis and make it even more compelling. Good job!
