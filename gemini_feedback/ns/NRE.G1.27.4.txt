Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on clarity, argumentation, structure, and potential improvements, based on the OCR content:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper attempts to assess the viability of carbon sequestration as a means of combating global warming. It presents a model-based analysis using MathCAD and explores the sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 levels to various carbon cycle processes. While the effort is commendable, the paper suffers from clarity issues, lack of precise definitions, some awkward phrasing, and could benefit from a more robust and critical discussion of the results. The conclusion is appropriate but could be strengthened.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevant Topic:** The paper addresses a significant and timely environmental issue.
*   **Model-Based Analysis:** Using MathCAD to simulate the carbon cycle is a good approach.
*   **Exploration of Variables:** The sensitivity analysis of different carbon cycle components is a valuable aspect.
*   **Acknowledging Limitations:** The paper acknowledges the complexity and uncertainty surrounding carbon sequestration.
*   The citation of the Kyoto protocol and Agrawal is valuable.
*   A focus on the deep ocean and it's role in storing carbon is appropriate.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

**1.  Clarity and Precision:**

*   **Definitions:** Provide clearer and more precise definitions for key terms:
    *   "Blackbody radiation": Explain in more detail what this is and why reducing atmosphere permeability matters.
    *   "Carbon sequestration": Define it formally at the beginning.
    *   "Fixation," "Respiration," "Downwelling," "Upwelling": Explain what these processes are physically and biologically. The paper mentions them but assumes the reader knows what they entail.
    *   "Giga tons (Gt) of carbon": Clarify if the units are Gt of C (carbon) or Gt of CO2 (carbon dioxide), it is important to be specific.

*   **Units:** Be consistent with units. The paper mentions "ppm" without clarifying what it's ppm of (CO2). It should be consistent with ppm or Gt units.

*   **Specificity in Method:** The methods section lacks detail.
    *   What were the specific values used for emissions, fixation, etc.?
    *   How were the variables "decreased by 50%" or "doubled" – relative to what baseline?
    *   Explain the MathCAD model and the source of the equation being used. Is it a generally accepted model or something created for this specific assignment?  If it's a simplified model, justify the simplifications.
    *   Explain the assumptions of the model, and why the model is acceptable.

*   **Results Clarity:** The results are hard to interpret.
    *   Clarify what "PPM???" means in Fig. 2 and 3.
    *   The discussion of the tables should be more clear and specific.
    *   Explain exactly what is changing in the model runs.

**2. Argumentation and Analysis:**

*   **Critical Evaluation:** The paper should provide a more critical and nuanced analysis.
    *   What are the potential negative consequences of carbon sequestration? (e.g., ocean acidification if too much CO2 is pumped into the deep ocean).
    *   What are the practical challenges and costs associated with scaling up carbon sequestration?

*   **Support Claims:** Back up claims with evidence from the model or other sources. For instance, "Reducing emissions appears to be a much more direct and effective way…" needs support. Show how the MathCAD simulation demonstrates this.

*   **Quantify Results:** Try to quantify the effectiveness of different sequestration approaches. If possible, calculate how much CO2 could realistically be sequestered using various methods and compare that to the amount that needs to be removed to stabilize the climate.

*   **Expand on Discussion:** The discussion is adequate but could be more insightful.
    *   Explore alternative sequestration methods (e.g., afforestation, biochar).
    *   Discuss the social, political, and economic dimensions of carbon sequestration and emissions reduction.

**3.  Structure and Organization:**

*   **Logical Flow:** Ensure a smooth and logical flow of ideas from introduction to conclusion.

*   **Improve introduction:** State your research question, hypothesis, and planned methods for testing this.

*   **Methods/Results:** Consider combining these sections to provide better integration of data and analysis.

**4. Writing Quality:**

*   **Grammar and Style:** Proofread carefully for grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.
*   **Conciseness:** Be more concise and avoid unnecessary repetition.
*   **Scientific Writing:** Use precise and objective language. Avoid overly casual or subjective statements (e.g., "seems like just sweeping dirt under the rug").
*   Some specific examples of awkward phrasing:
    *   "As means of fighting global warming" should be "As a Means of Fighting Global Warming"
    *   "Carbon sequestration appears to be a reasonable way" is vague and uncertain.
    *    "With CO2 emissions we didn't worry about the affects of putting excess carbon in to the" should be "We did not consider the effects of excess carbon in"

**5. Model and Code:**

*   This is difficult to evaluate without seeing the MathCAD code itself, but consider the following:
    *   **Model Validation:** How was the MathCAD model validated?  Were the results compared to other existing carbon cycle models or real-world data?
    *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** The sensitivity analysis is good, but make sure to clearly state how the variables were changed and justify the range of changes.

**Specific Examples and Suggestions:**

*   **Abstract:**  "Carbon sequestration was determined to be a valid method for removing carbon…" This is vague. Quantify it if possible (e.g., "…can remove approximately X Gt of carbon per year…").
*   **Introduction:** "Reducing emissions appears to be a much more direct and effective way..." This is a key conclusion, but it needs to be supported by the analysis in the paper.
*   **Methods:** Explain the time scale of the simulation more clearly. Why was it varied from 340 years to 1000 years?
*   **Results:**  The description of Figure 2 and 3 could be clearer and more concise.

**Revised Conclusion Ideas:**

A stronger conclusion might:

*   Summarize the key findings from the MathCAD simulation.
*   State clearly whether the model supports or refutes the hypothesis about carbon sequestration.
*   Acknowledge the limitations of the model and the uncertainties in the analysis.
*   Offer specific recommendations for future research or policy.

**In summary:**  This paper shows promise, but it requires significant revisions to improve clarity, strengthen the analysis, and provide a more compelling and well-supported argument. By addressing the points above, the paper can become a more valuable contribution to the discussion of climate change solutions. Good luck!
