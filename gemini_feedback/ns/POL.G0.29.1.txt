Okay, I can provide feedback on your paper "Seeking Hope at Home" about the history of housing discrimination and the impact of *Shelley v. Kraemer*.

**Overall Impressions:**

The paper tackles a complex and important topic. It demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context of housing discrimination and the legal battles surrounding it, particularly the significance of *Shelley v. Kraemer*. The writing is generally clear and well-organized. The argument that *Shelley v. Kraemer* was more of a galvanizing force than a complete solution is interesting and potentially insightful.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Focus:** The paper maintains a clear focus on the impact of *Shelley v. Kraemer* and effectively argues that its significance lies more in its galvanizing effect than its immediate practical consequences.
*   **Historical Context:** You provide a good overview of the history of housing discrimination, including the Great Migration, restrictive covenants, and the NAACP's efforts. This background is crucial for understanding the significance of *Shelley v. Kraemer*.
*   **Understanding of the Legal Issues:** You demonstrate a solid grasp of the legal arguments in *Shelley v. Kraemer* and related cases, including the complexities of "state action" and the Fourteenth Amendment.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical progression, starting with the historical context, moving to the *Shelley v. Kraemer* decision, and then discussing its impact and limitations.
*   **Good Use of Sources:** The paper relies on a range of reputable sources, indicating thorough research.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Develop Argument More Fully:** While the thesis is clear, you can strengthen the argument by delving deeper into the specific ways in which *Shelley v. Kraemer* galvanized the movement. For example:

    *   Provide more specific examples of how the decision boosted morale, attracted new supporters, or influenced subsequent legal strategies.
    *   Compare the pre-*Shelley v. Kraemer* and post-*Shelley v. Kraemer* periods to illustrate the difference in the movement's momentum.
*   **Address Counterarguments/Nuance:**
    *   **The other factors at play:** What other factors at the time were impacting the civil rights movement as a whole?
    *   **Why was Kennedy able to follow up on housing policies**? What was different from previous presidents who weren't able to make these kind of changes?
    *   **Other court cases impacted Civil Rights at the time:** Were other cases influencing attitudes?

*   **"Galvanized" vs. "Sparked":** In one section, you say that *"The Shelley decision did not end a movement but rather sparked one by infusing energy and confidence into fair housing advocates."*. Think about the difference between sparking and galvanizing, and lean more into which one you are trying to convey.
*   **Analyze Primary Sources More Deeply:** While you cite *Shelley v. Kraemer*, consider including a more detailed analysis of the opinion itself. What specific language in the decision had the greatest impact? How did the justices frame the issue?
*   **Address the Issue of "State Action" More Clearly:** The concept of "state action" in *Shelley v. Kraemer* is complex and has been the subject of much debate. Consider elaborating on the different interpretations of "state action" and how the decision shaped subsequent legal challenges to discrimination.
*   **Consider More Recent Developments:** While the paper focuses on the historical impact of *Shelley v. Kraemer*, you could briefly address more recent developments in housing discrimination and how the legacy of the decision continues to be relevant today.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Consider adding a more attention-grabbing opening sentence to draw the reader in.
*   **Clarity on "State Action":** In discussing the legal reasoning behind *Shelley v. Kraemer*, explicitly define "state action" and explain why the Court found that judicial enforcement of restrictive covenants constituted state action.
*   **Transition from 1950s to 1960s:** Smooth the transition between the discussion of redlining in the 1950s and the rise of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s. Explain how the continued existence of housing discrimination fueled the movement.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is generally good, but you could strengthen it by summarizing the main points of the paper and offering a final thought on the enduring legacy of *Shelley v. Kraemer*.

**Minor Edits:**

*   **Grammar and Style:** The writing is generally clear, but proofread carefully for any minor grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
*   **Citations:** Double-check all citations to ensure they are accurate and consistent with your chosen style.
*   **Word Choice:** In a few places, the word choice could be more precise. For example, consider replacing "conflated" with a more accurate term when discussing the relationship between housing and the Civil Rights movement.

**Overall, your paper shows a strong understanding of a significant topic. By further developing your argument, addressing counterarguments, and analyzing your sources more deeply, you can strengthen your paper and make an even more compelling case.**
