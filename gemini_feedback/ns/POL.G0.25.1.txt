Okay, I can provide feedback on the paper you sent. Here's a breakdown of strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and academic rigor:

**Overall Impression**

The paper provides a detailed summary and critique of Jon Entine's "Abraham's Children." It covers the main arguments of the book and identifies points of contention and potential biases. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the book's content and engages with some of the complex issues it raises. However, there are areas where the analysis could be strengthened, and the argumentation could be more focused and persuasive.

**Strengths:**

*   **Comprehensive Summary:** The paper does a good job of summarizing the key arguments and sections of Entine's book. It accurately represents the content, from the discussion of Jewish identity and genetics to the controversial claims about intelligence and disease.
*   **Identification of Key Issues:** The paper identifies the main areas of debate surrounding Entine's work, such as the nature vs. nurture argument, the validity of IQ scores, and the role of positive selection in Jewish history.
*   **Engagement with Counterarguments:** The paper acknowledges and incorporates counterarguments and alternative perspectives. It mentions other scientists who disagree with Entine's conclusions and presents different interpretations of the data.
*   **Use of Evidence:** The paper supports its claims with specific examples and citations from Entine's book and other sources.
*   **Critical Evaluation:** The paper offers a critical evaluation of Entine's arguments, pointing out potential biases, omissions, and weaknesses in his reasoning.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Argumentative Focus:** The paper feels more like a summary with critical comments than a focused argumentative essay. It lacks a clear thesis statement that articulates the student's overall perspective on Entine's work. What is the main point you want to make about this book?
*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper identifies important issues, the analysis could be more in-depth. For example, the discussion of the sociobiology debate and the Cochran-Harpending theory could be expanded and analyzed more critically.
*   **Organization:** The paper could benefit from a more structured organization. While it follows the general outline of Entine's book, the transitions between different topics can be abrupt. Clearer topic sentences and connecting phrases would improve the flow of the argument.
*   **Voice and Originality:** The paper relies heavily on summarizing Entine's arguments and the opinions of other commentators. It would be stronger if the student developed a more distinctive voice and offered more original insights.
*   **Balance:** There is a bit of an issue where the paper will state that Entine "fails to address the fact" that is important, but then states the fact directly after. Consider rephrasing to show that you are using Entine's own citations and notes to provide counterpoints and critiques.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Develop a Clear Thesis Statement:** Craft a strong thesis statement that clearly articulates your main argument about Entine's book. For example:

    *   "While Entine's 'Abraham's Children' provides a valuable overview of the genetic and cultural history of Jewish identity, its controversial claims about intelligence and disease are undermined by selective use of evidence and a failure to fully address alternative explanations."
    *   "Entine's book, though presenting itself as a scientific exploration, is ultimately an apologetic for genetic determinism, failing to adequately account for the complex interplay of culture, history, and environment in shaping Jewish identity and achievement."

2.  **Strengthen the Argument:**

    *   **Focus on a Central Claim:** Choose a specific aspect of Entine's book to focus on (e.g., the claims about intelligence, the use of genetics to define Jewish identity, the social and political implications of his research).
    *   **Provide More Evidence and Analysis:** Support your claims with more detailed evidence from the book and other sources. Analyze the evidence critically, pointing out flaws in Entine's reasoning, inconsistencies in his data, or alternative interpretations.
    *   **Address Counterarguments Thoroughly:** When presenting counterarguments, engage with them more fully. Explain why they are important and why Entine's response is inadequate.
    *   **Develop Your Own Voice:** Offer your own insights and perspectives on the issues raised by Entine's book. Don't simply summarize the opinions of others.

3.  **Improve Organization and Flow:**

    *   **Use Clear Topic Sentences:** Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main point.
    *   **Use Transitions:** Use transition words and phrases to connect paragraphs and ideas.
    *   **Structure the Paper Logically:** Consider organizing the paper around specific themes or arguments, rather than simply following the outline of Entine's book.

4.  **Enhance Academic Rigor:**

    *   **Check Citations:** Ensure that all citations are accurate and complete.
    *   **Broaden the Scope of Research:** Consult a wider range of sources to provide a more comprehensive overview of the scientific and social debates surrounding Entine's work.
    *   **Engage with Scholarly Literature:** Incorporate relevant scholarly articles and books to provide a deeper theoretical framework for your analysis.
    *   **Provide context to citations and mentions:** Remember the audience may not have any information on the topic, so make sure that your citations are clear and have an explanation, if necessary.

5.  **Address Specific Points:**

    *   **Sociobiology Debate:** Expand on the discussion of the sociobiology debate. Explain the main criticisms of this approach and why it remains controversial.
    *   **Cochran-Harpending Theory:** Analyze the Cochran-Harpending theory more critically. What are the strengths and weaknesses of their argument? What evidence do they use to support their claims? What are the potential ethical implications of their research?
    *   **IQ Scores:** Discuss the limitations and biases of IQ scores. Acknowledge the fact that IQ scores are influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and culture.
    *   **Ethical Considerations:** Explicitly address the ethical implications of Entine's research. What are the potential risks of using genetics to define group identity and to explain differences in intelligence and achievement?

**Specific Examples of Improvements:**

*   **Page 1, Paragraph 2:** Instead of just stating that Entine tackles these questions, briefly mention *how* he approaches them. Does he use a specific methodology?
*   **Page 4:** "Not all of history has been so positive..." is a vague transition. Be more specific about what aspect of history you're referring to.
*   **Page 7:** Explicitly state Risch's views on genetic drift and why Entine's omission is significant.
*   **Page 9:** Instead of just saying Entine "tries to claim," explain why his claim is misleading. What are the limitations of using SAT scores as a measure of intelligence?
*   **Page 11:** Briefly define "mutated lysosomes" for readers unfamiliar with the term.
*   **Page 12:** More context for Cochran's arguments would be helpful.
*   **Page 13:** The link between specific diseases and intelligence is somewhat glossed over.

**In summary:** This is a well-written and informative paper that demonstrates a good understanding of Entine's book. However, by developing a clearer thesis statement, strengthening the argument, improving the organization, and enhancing the academic rigor, you can elevate this paper to the next level. Remember to focus on a specific claim, provide more evidence and analysis, address counterarguments thoroughly, and develop your own voice. This critique should provide a solid foundation for revisions!
