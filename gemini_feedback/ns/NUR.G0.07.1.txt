Here's some feedback on the paper, covering various aspects:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Purpose:**  The paper clearly defines its goal: to assess registered nurses' satisfaction with nurse technician delegation in a specific unit. The rationale for this study is well-established, particularly in light of nursing shortages and increasing patient complexity.
*   **Well-Organized Structure:** The paper generally follows a logical structure. It introduces the problem, describes the methods used (survey development, distribution, and analysis), presents the findings, and discusses implications.
*   **Relates to Nursing Practice:** The research directly addresses a practical issue in nursing: how nurses feel about delegating tasks to technicians, which is very relevant to current nursing workflow issues.
*   **Good Context:**  The paper effectively integrates supporting literature to contextualize the issue of delegation. You cite relevant statistics on the nursing shortage and reference key professional organizations (ANA, National Council of State Boards of Nursing).
*   **Actionable Insights:** The findings identify specific areas for improvement, such as increasing tech support on every shift, improving nurse knowledge of delegation practices, and reinforcing the roles of technicians.

**Areas for Improvement (Content & Analysis):**

*   **Deeper Analysis of Survey Results:**
    *   While the paper presents the survey results, it could benefit from a deeper analysis and interpretation.
    *   Look for correlations and relationships within the data. For example, are nurses who are more knowledgeable about delegation also more comfortable with it? Do nurses who feel there's insufficient tech support delegate less?
    *   Consider performing some basic statistical analysis (e.g., calculating means, medians, standard deviations) to provide a more quantitative perspective.
*   **Address Limitations Thoroughly:**
    *   You acknowledge the limitations (small sample size, vacationing staff, limited tech presence), but elaborate on how they could have influenced the results. For example, if most night shift nurses didn't complete the survey, how could that skew the data?
    *   Suggest concrete ways to mitigate these limitations in future studies.
*   **Elaborate on Recommendations:**
    *   The recommendations for improvement (employee assistance programs, better tech orientation) are good, but could be expanded. How would the employee assistance program specifically address the issues identified in the survey? What should be included in the tech orientation program?
*   **Address Generalizability:**
    *   The study is specific to one unit. Discuss the limitations of generalizing the findings to other units or hospitals. What factors might make the findings unique to this particular environment?
*   **Address the lack of delegation:**
    *   You state that "Nearly 60% responded that they almost never or only sometimes delegate work to the tech to complete.". Why might this be happening? Do nurses not trust techs?
    *   Would it make more sense to train the nurses on how to delegate tasks to tech? Or should there be more incentive to delegate tasks?

**Areas for Improvement (Writing and Presentation):**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   While the writing is generally clear, look for opportunities to make it more concise. For example, some sentences could be shortened or rephrased for better readability.
*   **Formatting:**
    *   The running head is correct. The citation styles should be consistent.
*   **Graphs/Visuals:**
    *   The graphs are helpful, but ensure they are all clearly labeled and easy to interpret. The legends are a bit small and may need to be enlarged.
    *   It is unclear what the Likert scale is for each number.
    *   It might be useful to include the sample size/number of responses for each graph.
*   **Editing/Proofreading:**
    *   Carefully proofread the paper to catch any typos, grammatical errors, or inconsistencies.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Briefly mention the theoretical framework (if any) guiding your research. For example, did you use any specific models of delegation or leadership to inform your study?
*   **Methods:** Provide more detail about the survey instrument. How was it developed? What specific types of questions were asked? (You do this a bit, but expand.)  Consider including the survey questions in an appendix.
*   **Results:** Don't just state the findings. Explain *why* they are significant and what they suggest.
*   **Discussion/Conclusion:** Reiterate the main findings and their implications for practice. Conclude with a strong statement about the importance of further research in this area.

**Actionable steps**
1.  Review each graph and label with the likert scale.
2.  Go through the points from "areas for improvement", and implement the changes.
3.  Once you implement the points from "areas for improvement", read through the paper and revise as necessary.

By addressing these points, you can further strengthen the paper and enhance its impact on the field of nursing. Let me know if you want clarification or have any questions.
