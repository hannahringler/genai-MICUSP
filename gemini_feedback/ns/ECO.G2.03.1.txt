Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can provide feedback, focusing on areas like clarity, argumentation, methodology, and overall structure.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles an interesting and relevant question: how does household debt, particularly credit card debt, affect labor supply?  The topic is timely given the prevalence of consumer debt and its potential impact on economic behavior. The paper presents some initial empirical findings and proposes a research design to address the endogeneity issues inherent in the relationship.

**Strengths:**

*   **Relevant and Timely Topic:**  The paper addresses a significant issue in contemporary economics.
*   **Clear Research Question:** The paper clearly states the research question and its motivation.
*   **Literature Review:** The paper cites relevant literature on consumer debt, labor supply, and behavioral economics.
*   **Empirical Analysis:** The paper presents some initial empirical results using the SCF data.
*   **Identification Strategy:** The proposed use of the *Marquette* decision as an exogenous shock is a promising approach to address endogeneity.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper is generally well-organized with clear sections.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarity and Precision:**

*   **Define Key Terms Early:**  Clearly define "labor supply" (e.g., is it hours worked, labor force participation, or both?) and the different types of debt being considered (e.g., revolving vs. non-revolving).  Be precise in how you're measuring these.
*   **Explain the SCF Data in More Detail:**  Expand on the specifics of the SCF. What are the limitations of this data set. Why choose it?
*   **Elaborate on the Propensity Score:** In the causal story section, clarify which variables would you choose for estimating your propensity scores?

2.  **Methodology and Empirical Analysis:**

*   **Address the Sample Restriction:** Explain why you're restricting the sample to white, married, prime-age households. What are the potential biases introduced by this restriction? Acknowledge this early and explain.
*   **More Rigorous Justification of Controls:** Explain the rationale for including specific control variables in your regressions. What are you trying to control for?
*   **Discuss Potential Weaknesses of the *Marquette* Instrument:** Acknowledge and discuss potential limitations of using the *Marquette* decision as an instrument. For instance, were there other factors occurring at the same time that could affect labor supply?
*   **Address the Limited Time Frame:** The SCF data only covers a limited time period. Discuss how this might affect your results and the generalizability of your findings.
*   **Selection Bias:** Elaborate on selection issues, and why it should or shouldn't be a concern.

3.  **Argumentation and Interpretation:**

*   **Strengthen the Connection Between Theory and Empirics:** Explicitly link the theoretical framework (e.g., life-cycle model, behavioral economics) to the empirical results. Explain how your findings support or contradict the theoretical predictions.
*   **Discuss the Magnitude of the Effects:**  In addition to statistical significance, discuss the economic significance of your findings. Are the effects large enough to be practically meaningful?
*   **Address Alternative Explanations:** Consider alternative explanations for the observed relationships. For example, could reverse causality or omitted variable bias be driving the results?

4.  **Writing and Presentation:**

*   **Proofread Carefully:** There are minor grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper. Proofread carefully before submitting.
*   **Ensure Consistency in Formatting:** Make sure the citations and bibliography adhere to a consistent style.

**Specific Comments by Section:**

*   **Introduction:** Good overview. Strengthen the hook by emphasizing the magnitude of credit card debt problem.
*   **Literature Review:** Expand beyond credit card debt to consider the broader literature on household finance, labor supply elasticity, and the impact of financial shocks.
*   **Data:** As mentioned, provide more details on the SCF and justify its use.
*   **Debt and Labor Supply (Section IV):** Be very clear in the main argument of this section. Provide a simple example to demonstrate your hypothesis and better define your dependent and independent variables.
*   **A Causal Story (Section V):** Excellent idea to use the *Marquette* decision! Strengthen the causal chain by showing how the decision directly affected interest rates and credit access in different states.

**In summary:** This is a promising paper with a strong foundation. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, you can significantly strengthen the analysis and make a more compelling contribution to the literature. Remember to focus on clarity, rigor, and a thorough discussion of the potential limitations of your approach. Good luck!
