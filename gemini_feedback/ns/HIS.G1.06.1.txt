Okay, I can provide feedback on the paper.  I'll focus on strengths, weaknesses, and areas for potential improvement in terms of argumentation, analysis, use of evidence, and overall clarity.

**Overall Impression**

This is a well-written and thoughtful response paper. It demonstrates a good understanding of Coleman's and White's arguments and engages with them in a critical and nuanced way. The paper goes beyond simply summarizing the books; it develops an independent argument about the complexity of the relationship between colonists, Native Americans, and the environment.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:** The paper has a clear central argument: that Coleman's account of the colonists' relationship with wolves is too static and doesn't fully account for the adaptation and change that occurred as colonists encountered a new environment. This argument is effectively sustained throughout the paper.
*   **Strong Analysis:** You do a great job of analyzing Coleman's arguments and identifying potential weaknesses or limitations. You effectively use White's work on the Pawnee to challenge Coleman's view of cultural stasis.
*   **Evidence and Support:** The paper uses specific examples and quotes from Coleman and White to support its claims. The footnotes are also properly formatted.
*   **Nuanced Understanding:** The paper acknowledges the value and importance of Coleman's work while also pointing out its limitations. You show a balanced perspective and avoid simply dismissing Coleman's argument.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper has a logical structure. The introduction clearly sets out the argument, and the body paragraphs develop the argument in a coherent and organized way. The conclusion effectively summarizes the argument and restates its significance.
*   **Clarity and Style:** The writing is clear, concise, and engaging. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Exploration of Colonial Adaptation:** While the paper argues that the colonists adapted more than Coleman acknowledges, it could benefit from providing more concrete examples of this adaptation. What specific practices or beliefs changed? Providing further evidence of this adaption strengthens your argument. Examples could relate to farming, food, interacting with the Native Americans etc.
*   **Counterarguments:** The paper acknowledges Coleman's arguments, but it could be strengthened by addressing potential counterarguments to your own claims more directly. For instance, Coleman might argue that the examples of adaptation you provide are still outweighed by the overall persistence of certain core beliefs and practices. Discussing these counterarguments would demonstrate a deeper engagement with the existing scholarship.
*   **Elaborate on Wolf Reintroduction in Contemporary Society:** You mentioned that seeing the coyotes hung on fence posts reminded you of the vitriol that Coleman describes in early America. Connecting this back to Coleman's analysis more explicitly would add depth to your argument. For example, you could argue that even though the context has changed, the underlying attitudes and motivations of some ranchers remain similar to those of the colonists.
*   **Connection Between Lepore and Coleman:** You brought up Lepore's work to bring in an additional perspective but could connect her work to Coleman more clearly. What about his argument does Lepore support? Is there any aspect of the relationship with Native Americans that intersects with the dynamic that Coleman discusses regarding wolves?

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Incorporate Specific Examples of Colonial Adaptation:**
    *   **Farming practices:** Did colonists need to adapt their farming methods to the soil and climate of North America?
    *   **Food sources:** Did they incorporate new food sources from Native Americans into their diets?
    *   **Housing:** Did their housing styles change?
    *   **Governance:** Did they change systems of governance?
*   **Address Potential Counterarguments:**
    *   Coleman might argue that these adaptations were superficial and didn't fundamentally change the colonists' worldview or their relationship with nature.
    *   He might also argue that the violence towards wolves was driven by more than just practical concerns and that it was deeply rooted in cultural and religious beliefs.
*   **Refine the Conclusion:** Strengthen the conclusion by explicitly restating the paper's thesis and summarizing the key evidence and arguments that support it. You could also briefly discuss the broader implications of your argument for understanding colonial history and the relationship between humans and the environment.

**Revised ideas for conclusion**

"Ultimately, Coleman's work is beneficial due to his ability to highlight the role of non-human actors in the past. However, Coleman's lens might be too static. By drawing connections between White's cultural transformations to the Pawnee and our contemporary reactions to predators in rural communities, we can see that that colonists' culture and interactions with wolves might be more dynamic than initially proposed."

**In summary:**

This is a very good paper that demonstrates strong analytical and writing skills. By incorporating more specific evidence, addressing potential counterarguments, and refining the conclusion, you can further strengthen your argument and make your paper even more persuasive.

Good luck with your revisions!
