Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the paper, covering its strengths and areas for improvement, focusing on the philosophical argumentation, clarity, and writing style.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper tackles a complex philosophical problem (Pascal's Wager) with a clear thesis and well-structured arguments. It demonstrates a good understanding of the primary sources (Pascal, Schlesinger) and engages with relevant secondary literature (Lewis, Weinberg). The student demonstrates the ability to formulate and defend philosophical arguments, even if some points could be strengthened.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Structure:** The paper clearly states its thesis in the introduction (that Schlesinger's defense of Pascal's Wager regarding the mercenary nature is insufficient and fails to account for genuine belief). The arguments follow a logical progression.
*   **Understanding of the Material:** The paper demonstrates a grasp of Pascal's Wager, Schlesinger's arguments, and related philosophical concepts. The quotations are relevant and used effectively.
*   **Engagement with Objections:** The paper directly addresses the "gravest objection" and articulates counterarguments to Schlesinger's position.
*   **Critical Thinking:** The paper doesn't simply summarize arguments; it critically analyzes them, pointing out weaknesses and offering alternative perspectives. The "slippery slope" argument is a good example of this.
*   **Good Use of Examples and Analogies:** The analogy to the Devil offering rewards is thought-provoking and helps to illustrate the point about the potential problems with "noble greed."

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Exploration of "Genuine Belief":** The central argument hinges on the concept of "genuine belief."  The paper touches on this, but it needs more explicit and rigorous definition and exploration. What *exactly* constitutes genuine belief in this context? Is it solely about intellectual assent, or does it require something more (e.g., a particular kind of experience, a transformation of character)? How does it relate to faith? Exploring different conceptions of belief (e.g., evidentialism vs. non-evidentialism) could strengthen the argument.
*   **Clarify the Connection Between "Greed" and Belief:**  The paper argues that appealing to greed is problematic because it can lead to a lack of genuine belief.  However, the link between the *motivation* (greed) and the *resulting belief* needs to be made more explicit. Why is a belief motivated by greed necessarily less genuine or less valuable than a belief motivated by, say, a desire for truth? Is the *source* of a belief always relevant to its *status*?
*   **Address Potential Counterarguments to Your Own Position:** The paper presents a strong critique of Schlesinger, but it would be strengthened by anticipating and addressing potential objections to its own claims. For example:
    *   Could someone argue that *any* initial motivation for religious belief is acceptable, as long as it leads to a genuine connection with God?
    *   Is it *always* wrong to "deaden" one's faculties in pursuit of faith? Are there circumstances where this might be justified?
*   **Strengthen the Argument Against "Nobel Greed":** It should be made clear why one can't have "noble greed". What is greedy about having a relationship with God.
*   **More Precise Language:**
    *   Avoid phrases like "seems to be" when you can make a more definitive statement. Instead of "This seems to be the unstated objection...", try "The unstated objection is..." (if you're confident that's the case).
    *   "Debases the individual": This is a strong claim. Explain *how* and *why* seeking God for reward debases someone.
*   **Develop the connection between the ideas better:**
    *   Elaborate on the connection between Pascal's view that belief is obtained through religious behavior and your claim that this deadens the human faculties. Provide a more detailed explanation of how the prescribed behavior might lead to the suppression of critical thinking or rational inquiry.
*   **Clarify who it's meant to appeal to:**
    *   Is Pascal really appealing to the apparently intended audience solely in terms of their greed. Is there any evidence of that?

**Specific Suggestions/Line-by-Line Comments:**

*   **Introduction:** "His argument that an appeal to greed is acceptable could be strengthened, and he fails to adequately account for how the bettor acquires genuine belief in God, which, I will argue, is necessary to the essence of religion."  This is a good thesis statement.
*   **Page 1:** "Simply betting on God because one has nothing to lose by it hardly seems the sort of behavior a perfectly good being would endorse." This point could be expanded to discuss the issue of sincerity and the potential for hypocrisy.
*   **Page 2:** The "slippery slope" argument is a good start, but it needs more development.  Explain *why* suspicion of greed in betting on God is different from suspicion of self-interest in other actions.
*   **Page 2:** "If the devil also had his say..." This is a compelling analogy. Consider developing it further to explore the idea of competing "wagers" and the difficulty of choosing between them.
*   **Page 3:** The reflection on the nature of the wager and Pascal's audience is a good point. It adds nuance to the analysis.
*   **Page 3:** "Faithful, honest, humble..." Consider briefly explaining why these traits are relevant to the argument.
*   **Page 4:** "Love for the divine, however, is not the same as belief in the divine."  This is a key claim, and it needs to be supported with further explanation.
*   **Page 4:** "Pascal's mechanism for obtaining belief demands deadening of the faculties that make us human." This is a strong statement, and it needs to be backed up with specific examples and evidence from Pascal's writings or from interpretations of his work.
*   **Page 5:** "one might reply that it can be called wrong because it demands belief based on something other than epistemic reasons." Excellent point.
*   **Page 5:** "To believe something without seeking to know whether it is true is not really belief." This statement could be debated, and there are different philosophical positions on this. If this is the core of the argument this needs to be fleshed out more.
*   **Page 6:** The quote from Samuel Johnson is a nice addition and supports your point about the difficulty of self-deception.

**In summary:**

This is a solid philosophical paper that demonstrates critical thinking and a good understanding of the material. By further developing the central arguments, addressing potential counterarguments, and refining the language, the paper can be made even stronger. Focus on clarifying the concept of "genuine belief" and its relationship to motivation, and on anticipating and responding to possible objections to your own position.
