Here's some feedback on the essay "Bloom the Critic," focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The essay presents a clear and interesting argument, comparing and contrasting the approaches of Odysseus and Leopold Bloom to handling infidelity (and more broadly, life's challenges). The analysis of Bloom's character and his use of interpretation, particularly in light of Wittgenstein's philosophy, is insightful. The writing is generally strong and demonstrates a good grasp of both *Ulysses* and Wittgenstein.

**Strengths**

*   **Strong Thesis:** The central argument – that Bloom acts as an "epic critic" rather than an "epic strategist" and that his strength lies in reinterpretation – is clearly articulated and consistently pursued throughout the essay.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The essay delves into the complexities of Bloom's character and actions. The connection to Wittgenstein provides a sophisticated framework for understanding Bloom's approach to Molly's infidelity.
*   **Textual Evidence:** You use specific examples from the text of *Ulysses* to support your claims. The analysis of the list of crimes in "Ithaca" is particularly well done.
*   **Clear Structure:** The essay follows a logical progression, building its argument step-by-step. The comparison to Odysseus is a useful and recurring point of reference.
*   **Sophisticated Vocabulary and Tone:** The writing is academic and well-suited to a college-level essay.
*   **Well-Referenced and Complies to Expected Citation Style:** Correct use of MLA.

**Areas for Improvement and Suggestions**

*   **Expanding the Connection to Wittgenstein:** While the use of Wittgenstein is compelling, the essay could benefit from a more in-depth explanation of how his philosophy directly applies to Bloom's thought processes. For example:
    *   Instead of just stating Wittgenstein "provides a model," elaborate on *which* aspects of Wittgenstein's *Philosophical Investigations* are most relevant. Is it the concept of "language games," "seeing-as," or something else? Explain the connection more explicitly.
    *   Consider expanding on the limitations of applying Wittgenstein to Bloom. Are there ways in which Bloom's reinterpretation *differs* from Wittgenstein's concepts? Acknowledging potential nuances or complexities can strengthen your argument.
*   **Exploring the Negative Aspects of Bloom's "Criticism":** The essay acknowledges that Bloom's approach involves a degree of "dullness." However, you could push this point further. Does Bloom's constant reinterpretation ever become a form of avoidance or self-deception? Are there moments when action might be preferable to endless analysis? Addressing these counterarguments would add depth and nuance to your interpretation.
*   **Clarifying Bloom's "Laziness":** The essay states, "As Bloom's mind proceeds through possible reactions to Molly's infidelity, he begins to found his justifications for inaction less upon ethics than upon laziness." Consider further explaining what you mean by "laziness." Is it a form of passive resistance, a sign of emotional exhaustion, or something else?
*   **Strengthening the Concluding Paragraph:** The conclusion summarizes the main points but could be more impactful. Instead of simply restating the comparison between Odysseus and Bloom, consider:
    *   A final, powerful image or statement that encapsulates your interpretation.
    *   A broader reflection on the significance of Bloom's "epic criticism" in a modern world.
    *   Implications for future literary analysis of the book.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Page 3 - "Two wrongs did not make one right":** While this is a good example of Bloom's moral convictions, consider exploring the underlying motivations more. Is he genuinely convinced of this, or is it a convenient excuse for inaction?

**Example Edits**

*   **Original:** "Wittgenstein provides a model that helps conceptualize Bloom's ability to transform his relationship to Molly."
*   **Revised:** "Wittgenstein's concept of 'seeing-as,' as articulated in his *Philosophical Investigations*, offers a compelling framework for understanding Bloom's reinterpretation of Molly's infidelity. Wittgenstein argues that a single object can be perceived in multiple ways, not because the object itself changes, but because our perspective and interpretation shift. This principle directly mirrors Bloom's approach..."

**Revised example for page 7**:

*   **Original:** Finally, Bloom concludes by expanding the sphere of his consideration from the body of his wife to “the apathy of the stars." The realization that at a grand, cosmic level his wife's infidelity does not signify anything helps Bloom come to terms with the act, but even Bloom's willingness to think on such a broad scale proves that his mind does not imprison itself within the trauma it confronts.
*   **Revised:** Finally, Bloom concludes by expanding the sphere of his consideration from the body of his wife to “the apathy of the stars." This cosmic apathy echoes the stoic perspective, but does it truly resolve Bloom's personal turmoil, or is it a form of intellectual escapism? The very act of intellectualizing trauma may allow Bloom to avoid directly confronting his emotions.

**Overall, this is a well-written and insightful essay. By further developing the connection to Wittgenstein, exploring the nuances of Bloom's character, and strengthening the conclusion, you can elevate it to an even higher level.**
