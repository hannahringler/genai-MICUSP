Okay, I can provide some feedback on this sociology paper.  Here's a breakdown of strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and overall impact:

**Overall Impression**

The paper tackles an important topic - the social construction of gender, particularly within elementary school settings.  It demonstrates a good understanding of core sociological concepts and theorists (West & Zimmerman, Kessler & McKenna, Thorne, etc.).  The paper does a decent job of drawing connections between micro-level interactions and broader social structures. However, the paper is not as engaging as it could be and lacks some clarity. 

**Strengths**

*   **Solid Theoretical Grounding:**  The paper effectively utilizes established sociological theories to support its arguments.  The references to West & Zimmerman's "doing gender," Kessler & McKenna's "gender natural attitude," and Thorne's work on gender in schools provide a strong theoretical framework.
*   **Clear Definition of Key Concepts:** The paper attempts to clarify key terms like "gender," "sex," and "gender natural attitude," which is important for a nuanced discussion.
*   **Use of Empirical Examples:**  The paper effectively uses examples from Thorne's research on elementary schools to illustrate the concepts being discussed. The specific instances (e.g., girls using makeup, recess activities divided by gender, reactions to boys playing jump rope) make the abstract concepts more concrete.
*   **Awareness of Nuance:** It acknowledges that gender is not simply a matter of free choice and is deeply embedded in social structures and culture.
*   **Good Structure:** The paper follows a logical progression, introducing the topic, defining key concepts, providing evidence, and drawing conclusions.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Lack of Original Analysis:** The paper primarily summarizes and synthesizes existing research. While this demonstrates understanding, it lacks a unique argument or original insights. The paper could benefit from a more critical engagement with the existing literature.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:**  Some sentences and paragraphs are wordy and could be more direct. This can make it harder for the reader to follow the argument. Examples: "The distinctions that are made within the classroom and shaped within oneself are constructions into the professed ideal forms of male and female."  This could be simplified.
*   **Limited Scope of Evidence:** While Thorne's research is well-used, relying heavily on a single study weakens the argument's generalizability. Incorporating additional empirical evidence (from other studies, observations, or even personal experiences) would strengthen the claims.
*   **The conclusion does not provide any recommendations.** It would be helpful to provide a recommendation for future improvements.
*   **Passive Voice:** The paper has multiple sentences written in passive voice that can confuse the reader.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Develop a Stronger Central Argument (Thesis):** Instead of simply describing the social construction of gender, formulate a more specific and arguable thesis statement. What specific aspect of this construction are you focusing on? What is your perspective on it? For example:
    *   "While elementary schools inadvertently reinforce gender binaries through seemingly innocuous practices, a critical examination of these practices offers opportunities to promote more inclusive and fluid understandings of gender identity."
    *   "The persistence of a gender natural attitude in elementary schools, despite increasing awareness of gender fluidity, highlights the enduring power of social institutions to shape individual perceptions and behaviors."
2.  **Expand the Scope of Evidence:**
    *   **Literature Review:** Include a wider range of sociological perspectives on gender. Consider incorporating feminist theory, queer theory, or critical race theory to offer a more complex analysis.
    *   **Contemporary Examples:**  Use examples that are relevant to the current social landscape. How are gender roles being challenged or reinforced in contemporary schools and popular culture?
3.  **Strengthen the Analysis and Discussion:**
    *   **Critical Engagement:** Don't just summarize the work of other scholars. Analyze their arguments, identify limitations, and offer your own interpretations.
    *   **Connect Micro and Macro Levels:** Explicitly explain how the micro-level interactions you describe contribute to broader patterns of gender inequality and social stratification.
    *   **Explore Counterarguments:** Acknowledge alternative perspectives on the issue. For example, are there arguments that gender roles are beneficial in some ways? Addressing these counterarguments will make your argument more persuasive.
4.  **Improve Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   **Sentence Structure:**  Rewrite sentences that are overly complex or passive. Use active voice whenever possible.
    *   **Paragraph Organization:**  Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and that the supporting sentences are logically connected.
    *   **Eliminate Redundancy:**  Cut out unnecessary words and phrases.
5.  **Refine the Conclusion:**
    *   **Restate the Thesis:** Briefly restate your main argument in a new and compelling way.
    *   **Summarize Key Findings:** Highlight the most important points you made in the paper.
    *   **Discuss Implications:** What are the broader implications of your findings? What actions can be taken to address the issues you have identified?
    *   **Offer Recommendations:** Suggest potential recommendations for future improvements that elementary schools can make.
6.  **Proofread Carefully:**  Pay close attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
7.  **Formatting:** The format of this paper can be improved. Please provide indentation in the paragraph.

**Revised Example (Illustrative)**

Let's take an example sentence from the original and revise it for clarity and impact:

**Original:** "The distinctions that are made within the classroom and shaped within oneself are constructions into the professed ideal forms of male and female."

**Revised:** "In classrooms, students internalize and reproduce socially constructed ideals of masculinity and femininity."

**By being more direct and active, the revised sentence is easier to understand and more engaging.**

**In Summary**

This is a good starting point, but with revisions that focus on developing a stronger argument, expanding the scope of evidence, and improving clarity, you can elevate this paper to the next level.

Good luck with your revisions! Let me know if you have any other questions.
