Here's some feedback on the paper about Chaucer's Pardoner:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis:** The paper has a clear and focused argument that Chaucer's portrayal of the Pardoner serves as a sharp critique of religious hypocrisy and the commercialization of faith in the 14th century.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** The paper demonstrates a thorough understanding of Chaucer's text, particularly the General Prologue and the Pardoner's Prologue and Tale. It offers close readings of specific passages, pointing out linguistic nuances, irony, and contradictions.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper progresses logically, starting with the Pardoner's portrait in the General Prologue, then moving to his Prologue and Tale, and finally connecting him to other religious figures. Each section builds on the previous one.
*   **Solid Evidence:** The paper effectively uses direct quotes from *The Canterbury Tales* to support its claims.
*   **Insightful Connections:** The paper goes beyond simply identifying hypocrisy; it attempts to explain why Chaucer might have chosen to portray the Pardoner in this way and what this reveals about Chaucer's views on religion.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** While the analysis is strong, some sentences and paragraphs are a bit dense and could be more concise. Consider breaking down long sentences and rephrasing complex ideas for greater clarity.
*   **Developing Connections with Broader Historical/Cultural Context:**  The paper gestures towards the commercial nature of the 14th-century church, but it could strengthen its argument by explicitly linking the Pardoner's character to specific historical or cultural trends of the time. For example, you could briefly discuss the sale of indulgences or the corruption within the church hierarchy.
*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While the Pardoner is undeniably negative, consider exploring any subtle nuances in Chaucer's portrayal. Is there any ambiguity in Chaucer's attitude? Does the Pardoner's own awareness of his hypocrisy add another layer of complexity? Addressing these points would strengthen the argument and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the text.
*   **Avoid Overstating the Obvious:** Some statements are overly emphatic and could be toned down. For instance, "Chaucer's narrator is not subtle in criticizing the Pardoner..." might be rephrased to something like, "Chaucer's criticism of the Pardoner is overt..."
*   **Proofread Carefully:** There are a few minor grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper. Proofreading carefully before submission is essential.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** While the introduction presents a clear thesis, it could be made even more engaging by providing a brief overview of the Pardoner's character and a hint of the specific contradictions that will be explored.
*   **Pardoner's Portrait:** When discussing the Pardoner's appearance, try to connect his sartorial choices with specific contemporary trends or social anxieties. What does his attempt to be "fashionable" reveal about his social aspirations and insecurities?
*   **Connections to Other Religious Figures:** In the section comparing the Pardoner to the Prioress, Monk, and Friar, be more specific about the types of "posturing" they engage in and how these behaviors are similar to or different from the Pardoner's hypocrisy.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points, but it could be made more impactful by offering a final, thought-provoking reflection on the lasting relevance of Chaucer's critique of religious hypocrisy.

**Revised Example Snippets**

Here are some suggestions for rephrasing sections for greater conciseness:

*   **Original:** "The Pardoner, when judged by the company he keeps, comes off as lowly and somewhat extortionate, especially as the characters of his companions are revealed."

    *   **Revised:** "By placing the Pardoner among these coarser pilgrims, Chaucer immediately casts him as morally suspect."
*   **Original:** "The Pardoner attempts to cultivate a modern, sleek appearance but instead appears foolish to his companions."

    *   **Revised:** "The Pardoner strives for a fashionable appearance, but his efforts only make him seem ridiculous."

By addressing these points, you can elevate the paper to an even higher level of analysis and argumentation.
