Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback on the paper, covering its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper is a well-researched and structured policy memo targeted at Senator Obama. It effectively argues for including coal-to-liquids (CTL) incentives in the H.R. 6 bill. The memo demonstrates a solid understanding of the technical, political, and administrative aspects of the issue. The writing style is professional and persuasive.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Executive Summary:** The summary clearly outlines the problem, proposed solution, and benefits. This is essential for a policy memo.
*   **Strong Argumentation:** The paper presents a multi-faceted argument, covering national security, climate change, economic development, and political gains.
*   **Solid Research and Support:** The memo is well-researched, citing a variety of sources to support its claims.
*   **Targeted Audience Awareness:** The memo is clearly tailored to Senator Obama's political context, considering his past positions, potential gains, and concerns about environmental groups.
*   **Consideration of Counterarguments:** The paper acknowledges potential opposition (e.g., from environmental groups) and offers counterarguments.
*   **Structured and Organized:** The memo follows a logical structure with clear headings and subheadings, making it easy to follow.
*   **Appendices:** The inclusion of appendices provides helpful details and context without cluttering the main text.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Implementation Concerns:** While the paper acknowledges administrative feasibility, this section is comparatively weaker than the others. The identified implementation problems are somewhat general, and the solutions are less concrete.
*   **Environmental Group Opposition:** The response to environmental group opposition could be strengthened. It presents a "lesser of two evils" approach, which might not be entirely convincing.
*   **Overly Optimistic Tone:** In some places, the memo adopts a slightly optimistic tone, particularly regarding the ease of achieving political gains.
*   **Reliance on Second-Hand Information** The paper depends heavily on second-hand sources.

**Areas for Improvement**

1.  **Strengthen Implementation Section:**

    *   **Be More Specific:** Provide more specific examples of how the DOE might struggle with implementation, beyond simply stating that it "may find its new task onerous." Consider specific regulations, data collection challenges, or potential conflicts with existing DOE priorities.
    *   **Develop More Robust Solutions:** Move beyond general suggestions like "clear directives" and "Congressional review." Suggest specific mechanisms for oversight, collaboration with other agencies (like the EPA), or targeted training programs for DOE staff.
    *   **Address Cost:** Acknowledge the potential costs associated with monitoring lifecycle emissions and enforcing regulations.
2.  **Refine Response to Environmental Concerns:**

    *   **Quantify Trade-offs:** Provide a more detailed analysis of the environmental trade-offs involved. For example, estimate the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions versus the environmental impact of increased coal mining.
    *   **Explore Mitigation Strategies:** Suggest specific strategies to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of coal mining, such as promoting responsible mining practices, investing in reclamation efforts, or supporting research into cleaner coal technologies.
    *   **Highlight Co-benefits:** Emphasize any potential co-benefits of CTL, such as reducing reliance on foreign oil (and its associated environmental risks) or supporting the development of biomass-to-liquids technology.
    *   **Tailor the Message:** Recognize that different environmental groups have different priorities. Tailor the message to address their specific concerns.
3.  **Adjust Tone:**

    *   **Acknowledge Challenges:** While maintaining a persuasive tone, acknowledge the challenges involved in achieving political consensus and implementing the proposed policy.
    *   **Be Realistic about Gains:** Avoid language that suggests guaranteed political gains. Instead, emphasize the potential benefits and the importance of careful planning and execution.
4.  **Consider alternative sources**

    *   **Research alternative sources:** Rely on more reputable data collection sites and databases.

**Specific Comments on the Text**

*   **Citations:** Citations generally follow a consistent format, but double-check for any inconsistencies or missing information.
*   **Formatting and Typos:** Proofread carefully for any typos or formatting errors.

**Example Revision (Addressing Implementation):**

**Original:**

> "The operational demands of the proposed measures will likely be high... DOE is certainly not the EPA and may well find its new task onerous and contrary to their usual goal of increasing energy production, leading to resistance to implementation. These two problems can be managed, however, if DOE is directed (with appropriate additional funding) to create a standard lifecycle analysis model within a year and if Congress follows up with regular review of the implementation, using funding cuts as a potential stick."

**Revised:**

> "The operational demands of the proposed measures will be significant.  DOE staff, accustomed to focusing on energy production, may lack expertise in lifecycle emissions analysis and environmental monitoring.  For example, effectively verifying the 20% emissions reduction requirement will necessitate developing sophisticated models that account for variations in coal sourcing, transportation, and plant efficiency. Moreover, the limited legislative record may allow for emphasis on production over environmental protection. To mitigate these challenges, Congress should (1) mandate that DOE collaborate with the EPA to develop a standardized, publicly available lifecycle analysis model within one year; (2) allocate specific funding for training DOE staff in environmental monitoring and emissions verification techniques; and (3) establish clear performance metrics tied to both energy production and emissions reductions, with Congressional oversight linked to future funding decisions."

**In Summary**

This is a strong policy memo with a compelling argument. By strengthening the implementation section and refining the response to environmental concerns, you can make it even more persuasive and impactful. Overall, this is a well-written and thoughtful piece of work. Good job!
