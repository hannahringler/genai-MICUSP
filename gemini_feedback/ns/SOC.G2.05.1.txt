Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

**Overall Impressions:**

*   The paper presents a thoughtful and well-structured analysis of the concept of social class. The author demonstrates a good understanding of the core arguments and debates surrounding class analysis.
*   The paper demonstrates critical thinking. The author challenges existing theories, offers nuanced perspectives, and avoids oversimplification.
*   The writing is clear, concise, and academic in tone. The organization is logical, and the arguments are generally well-supported.
*   The paper demonstrates a strong grasp of the relevant literature and uses sources effectively to support claims.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Structure:** The paper clearly states its purpose (assessing the strengths/weaknesses of subjective vs. objective definitions of class and advocating for Parkin's approach). Each paragraph contributes to the overall argument.
*   **Engagement with Key Authors:** The paper effectively engages with the work of Kingston, Grusky & Weeden, Wright, and Parkin. It accurately summarizes their arguments and offers thoughtful critiques.
*   **Nuanced Arguments:** The author avoids taking overly simplistic positions. They acknowledge the complexities of class and the limitations of various theoretical approaches. The discussion of class consciousness and its necessity for class membership is particularly insightful.
*   **Good Use of Examples:** The Costco vs. Wal-Mart example is effective in illustrating the author's point about the potential for capitalists to act in ways that benefit both themselves and their workers.
*   **Clear conclusion:** The paper sums up the points made in the body.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Exploration of Parkin:** While the paper ultimately argues in favor of Parkin's neo-Weberian approach, it could benefit from a more in-depth explanation of his theory. Detailing specific aspects of Parkin's work, such as his concept of "social closure," would strengthen the argument.
*   **Counterarguments:** While the author critiques other perspectives well, consider including more specific counterarguments. For example, address the arguments those who might disagree with Parkin.
*   **Develop the idea of subjective vs. objective class.**: The paper refers to the tension between them. It would be a great addition to define the terms outright early in the paper.
*   **Expand on "Realistic and Practical"**: The author states in the introduction that Parkin's approach is "realistic and practical." In the conclusion, address this more directly. Explain *why* it is realistic and practical.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Consider explicitly defining what you mean by "subjective" and "objective" bases for defining class in the introduction. This will help the reader understand the core debate.
*   **Grusky and Weeden:**
    *   While you challenge their idea that class consciousness is necessary, could you elaborate on why their argument might be appealing? Acknowledge the potential benefits of occupational groupings, such as more precise measurement of inequality.
*   **Wright Critique:**
    *   Your critique of Wright is strong, but consider addressing a potential counterargument: that Costco's actions are ultimately driven by profit motives and don't necessarily reflect a genuine concern for workers' well-being.
*   **Parkin's Theory:**
    *   Explain Parkin's concept of "social closure" in more detail. How does it relate to class analysis? How does his emphasis on authority alongside property ownership improve our understanding of class?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Explicitly reiterate *why* Parkin's approach is more "realistic and practical" than the alternatives you've discussed.
    *   Consider adding a brief concluding sentence that speaks to the broader implications of your argument. What are the practical consequences of adopting Parkin's perspective on class?

**Minor Edits/Suggestions:**

*   "[C]ommon to all class theories' - add an apostrophe after theories.
*  "...the interests of workers and capitalists are deeply antagonistic, one of the core ideas of Marxist class analysis" (5). At the same time, Wright admits in a footnote that there is nothing stopping an individual capitalist from being an enthusiastic socialist." -> The sentence is a little long and clunky.
* "There is even a distribution of power within any particular class for the same reason." -> The sentence is a little vague and confusing. Rephrase it for clarity.
*   Re-read the paper to check for any other spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.

By addressing these points, you can further strengthen your argument and create an even more compelling and insightful analysis of social class. Good job!
