Okay, I can provide feedback on the paper about ethics in international development. Here's a breakdown of strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Thought-Provoking and Critical:** The paper engages with complex issues and doesn't shy away from critiquing popular approaches to international development. It raises important questions about the effectiveness and ethics of foreign aid.
*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The paper presents a clear argument, particularly focusing on the limitations of blanket solutions (like Sachs' "Big Push") and advocating for a more nuanced, locally-driven approach.
*   **Good Use of Sources:** The paper references and engages with key thinkers in the field (Sachs, Easterly) and incorporates real-world examples (China, India, Malawi).
*   **Well-Structured:** The paper has a logical flow, starting with a general overview and moving to specific critiques and recommendations.
*   **Strong Examples:** The historical examples (Europe's development, American Revolution) and the modern examples (Malawi's fertilizer subsidies, bed net distribution) help illustrate the arguments.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper raises important points, some arguments could benefit from further development and more in-depth analysis. Sometimes the paper jumps from point to point without fully exploring the nuances.
*   **Counterarguments/Nuance:** While the paper effectively critiques certain approaches, it could benefit from explicitly acknowledging and addressing potential counterarguments to its own proposals.
*   **Specificity of Recommendations:** The recommendations, particularly regarding how to implement a more locally-driven approach, could be more specific and actionable.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** In some places, the writing could be more concise and the arguments more clearly articulated.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** Could use more recent research, reports or studies to back up claims.

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Strengthen the Central Argument/Thesis:**

    *   Ensure the thesis statement is crystal clear and directly addresses the ethics of international development, especially how the paper will propose a more ethical way.

2.  **Develop Counterarguments:**

    *   **Sachs' "Big Push":** Acknowledge the potential benefits of a large-scale coordinated effort in certain situations (e.g., immediate disaster relief, large-scale infrastructure projects). Explain why, despite these potential benefits, the risks outweigh the rewards in the long term for sustainable development.
    *   **Local control:** Acknowledge some of the risks that can come with complete local control, such as instances of corruption in some aid projects. Propose strategies to mitigate these risks.
    *   **Limitations to agriculture subsidies**: Acknowledge they do not always work and sometimes harm the population.

3.  **Specificity in Recommendations:**

    *   **The Role of Aid Organizations:** What specific actions should aid organizations take to shift towards a more demand-driven approach? (e.g., conducting participatory needs assessments, funding local initiatives, providing technical assistance).
    *   **Metrics and Accountability:** How can donors and recipients measure the success of locally-driven projects? How can accountability be ensured?
    *   **Market-Based Solutions:** Elaborate on the potential challenges of market-based solutions (e.g., access for the poorest of the poor, potential for exploitation).

4.  **Enhance Specific Arguments:**

    *   **Resource Curse/Aid Dependence:** Provide more specific examples of countries negatively affected by aid dependence. Explore the mechanisms by which aid can undermine local governance and accountability.
    *   **Historical Comparisons:** Be cautious about drawing direct parallels between historical development in the West and current development challenges. Acknowledge the unique context of developing nations today.
    *   **Malawi Example:** Cite the NYT article directly in the text (not just in parentheses). Provide more details on the specific policies Malawi implemented and the challenges they faced.
    *   **Local Knowledge:** Explain the kind of information that local people may know that will help aid projects be successful.

5.  **Refine Language and Style:**

    *   **Conciseness:** Review each paragraph and sentence to see if the ideas can be expressed more directly and efficiently.
    *   **Clarity:** Define any potentially ambiguous terms (e.g., "extreme poverty").
    *   **Tone:** Maintain a balanced and objective tone. Avoid overly strong or sweeping statements.

**Proofread Carefully:**

*   Ensure there are no grammatical errors, typos, or formatting issues.

**Revised Outline:**

Here's a possible revised outline incorporating the suggestions:

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Engage the reader with examples (Bono, Jolie).
    *   State the central problem: The ethics of international development, particularly the tension between top-down and bottom-up approaches.
    *   Thesis statement: A more effective and ethical approach to international development prioritizes locally-driven solutions, addresses basic needs (agriculture and healthcare), and empowers communities to make decisions about their own development.
2.  **Critique of Top-Down Approaches:**
    *   Discuss Sachs' "Big Push" and its limitations.
    *   The resource curse/aid dependence: Explain how large-scale aid can distort incentives and undermine local governance. Give examples.
    *   Explain limitations to agriculture subsidies.
3.  **Importance of Agriculture and Healthcare:**
    *   Argue that these are foundational for economic growth.
    *   Provide examples of successful agricultural revolutions (China, India, Malawi).
    *   Discuss the importance of addressing healthcare challenges (malaria, HIV/AIDS).
4.  **The Case for Locally-Driven Development:**
    *   Explain how to best deliver malaria nets.
    *   Emphasize the importance of participatory needs assessments and community ownership.
    *   Address potential challenges of a localized strategy, such as corruption.
5.  **The Ethics of Choice:**
    *   Argue that the people affected by aid projects should have the final say in decisions.
    *   Explain how donors can solicit and incorporate local preferences.
6.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Restate the thesis.
    *   Summarize the key arguments.
    *   Offer a final thought on the importance of ethical and effective international development.

By addressing these areas, you can strengthen your paper and make it even more persuasive and impactful. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
