Okay, I've reviewed your philosophy paper. Here's a breakdown of the feedback, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic and the arguments for the apriority and intuitional nature of space. You engage with the arguments in a critical way, referencing secondary sources (Allison, Parsons, and Warren) to support your analysis. The writing is generally clear and organized, although there are some areas where it could be improved for greater clarity and persuasiveness.

**Strengths**

*   **Understanding of Kant:** You clearly grasp the core of Kant's arguments regarding space, including the distinction between A and B editions, and key concepts like apriority, intuition, and the relationship to experience.
*   **Critical Engagement:** You don't simply summarize Kant; you analyze his arguments, point out potential weaknesses, and engage with counterarguments from other philosophers (Allison, Parsons).
*   **Use of Secondary Sources:** You appropriately incorporate secondary sources to support your claims and engage with existing debates about Kant's philosophy.
*   **Organization:** The paper is logically structured, moving from the apriority arguments to the intuition argument, and within each section, presenting Kant's position, criticisms, and your own analysis.
*   **Clarity (Generally):** For the most part, your writing is clear and easy to follow, especially given the complexity of the material.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Depth of Analysis (Allison Critique):** While you identify the weakness in Allison's argument, you could delve deeper into *why* it's unsatisfactory. Explain more fully the consequences of Allison's interpretation and why Kant is so insistent on the spatial aspect of "outside."

    *   **Suggestion:** After stating that Allison's argument is unsatisfactory, elaborate further on why:
        *   Does it undermine Kant's transcendental project in some way?
        *   Does it lead to a misinterpretation of other key Kantian concepts?
        *   Does it fail to address the original objection effectively?

2.  **Parsons' Objection (Premises):** You mention that Parson's objects to Kant's premises, specifically about representing the non-existence of space. Elaborate on the distinction between logical possibility vs psychological inability.

    *   **Suggestion:** Include a more detailed explanation of the challenges in representing the non-existence of space.
        *   Does the fact that we can imagine a world without gravity mean space is irrelevant?
        *   Where does Kant define what is "representable"?

3.  **Clarity of Transition:** Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother.

    *   **Suggestion:** Use transition words and phrases to connect ideas more explicitly (e.g., "Furthermore," "However," "In contrast," "Therefore," "This suggests that").  At the end of each section, briefly conclude and indicate the direction of the next section.

4.  **Explanation of Kantian Terminology:** While you demonstrate understanding, the paper could benefit from brief, clear explanations of key Kantian terms, especially for readers who may not be intimately familiar with Kant.

    *   **Suggestion:** Define terms like "transcendental," "a priori," "intuition," and "concept" more explicitly when you first introduce them. Although this is a philosophy paper, assume a general audience.

5.  **Conclusion:** The conclusion is somewhat abrupt. It could be strengthened by:

    *   **Summarizing your main findings:** Briefly recap your analysis of Kant's arguments, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.
    *   **Offering a final judgment:** State your overall assessment of Kant's success in proving the apriority and intuitional nature of space.
    *   **Suggesting further avenues of inquiry:** (Optional) Briefly mention any remaining questions or potential directions for future research related to this topic.

6.  **Minor Style Points:**
    *   Pay attention to consistent use of quotation marks and citation style.
    *   Proofread carefully for any typos or grammatical errors.

**Specific Examples of Suggested Revisions**

*   **Allison Critique (Page 2):**
    *   Original: "Allison's argument, however, is unsatisfactory."
    *   Revised: "Allison's argument, however, is unsatisfactory *because it ultimately undermines Kant's insistence on the fundamental role of spatial relations in structuring our experience. By reducing 'outside' to merely 'distinct from,' Allison risks obscuring Kant's crucial point that our awareness of objects as distinct is inherently tied to their being located in different places within a spatial framework.*"

*   **Parsons' Objection (Page 3):**
    *   Original: "As Charles Parsons has noted in *The Cambridge Companion to Kant*, it is unclear exactly why it is impossible for us to represent the non-existence of space."
    *   Revised: "As Charles Parsons has noted in *The Cambridge Companion to Kant*, it is unclear exactly why it is impossible for us to *imagine* the non-existence of space. *While we can conceive of a world without certain physical laws (like gravity), and call that a logically consistent possibility, Kant seems to be claiming we can't form a mental picture, or 'intuition', of a world devoid of space.*

**In Summary**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that demonstrates a solid grasp of Kant's philosophy. By addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly by deepening your analysis of Allison's argument, providing more robust definitions, and adding more thoughtful transitions, you can elevate the paper to an even higher level. Good work!
