Okay, I've read through the paper and here's some feedback, focusing on its strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions to make it even stronger.

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-written and engaging personal reflection. The narrative is compelling, and the author effectively conveys their changing perspective on the American landscape through their cross-country bike trip. The writing is generally clear and thoughtful, and the essay fulfills the prompt of a personal reflection with creative writing elements.

**Strengths:**

*   **Compelling Narrative:** The essay tells a story that is interesting and relatable. The reader is drawn into the author's experience and can easily follow their journey.
*   **Clear Thesis (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, the essay communicates a clear central idea: the author's deepening connection to the American landscape through a physically and emotionally challenging journey.
*   **Effective Use of Sensory Details:** The author effectively uses sensory details to bring the landscape to life. Examples include descriptions of the "ponderosa pine forests and black lava fields," "sphagnum moss floors soft as fleece underfoot," the feel of rumble strips on a bike, the "lush valleys," "fast-running river," and the sight of wildflowers dotted with bison.
*   **Thoughtful Reflection:** The essay goes beyond simply recounting events. The author reflects on their changing attitudes, their growing appreciation for nature, and their critique of modern society's disconnect from the natural world.
*   **Strong Voice:** The author's personal voice is evident throughout the essay. The writing feels authentic and sincere.
*   **Good Structure:** The essay follows a logical progression, starting with a broad statement about Americans' separation from nature, then detailing the author's personal experience, and concluding with a reflection on the impact of the journey.
*   **Appropriate Use of Quotation:** The Lopez quote is well-integrated and supports the author's argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Explicit Thesis Statement:** While the central idea is clear, the essay could benefit from a more explicit thesis statement in the introduction. This would provide a clearer focus for the reader and strengthen the overall argument.  For example, you could add a sentence like: "Through the physical and mental challenges of a cross-country bike trip, I developed a profound appreciation for the diverse and often overlooked beauty of the American landscape, challenging my preconceived notions and fostering a deeper connection with the natural world."
*   **Deeper Analysis of Transformation:** While the essay describes the author's changing perspective, it could benefit from a deeper analysis of *how* and *why* this transformation occurred. What specific moments or experiences were most impactful? How did the physical challenges contribute to the emotional and intellectual growth?
*   **Strengthen Connection to Lopez Quote:**  Elaborate *specifically* on how your experience aligns with and expands upon Lopez's observation.  Don't just state that you agree; show the reader *how* your journey proves his point in a contemporary context. For example, you can say how biking across the country provided a deeper experience with the natural world compared to flying from San Francisco to Atlanta like Lopez describes.
*   **Vary Sentence Structure:** While the writing is generally good, there are a few instances where the sentence structure could be varied to improve the flow and rhythm.
*   **Proofreading:** A careful proofread is always recommended to catch any minor errors in grammar or spelling.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Add an explicit thesis statement at the end of the introduction.
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   In the paragraph about Pennsylvania, expand on *why* that day was so different. What specifically contributed to the new sense of confidence and excitement?
    *   In the paragraphs about the Midwest, consider adding a sentence or two about the environmental consequences of the widespread agriculture. This would add another layer to your reflection on the landscape.
    *   In the paragraph about "solar time," explore the *symbolism* of waking up with the sun. What did it mean to surrender to a natural rhythm after a lifetime of ignoring it?
    *   In the paragraph about Teton Pass, you can talk about how you truly feel like you were having a unique experience.
*   **Conclusion:**  Instead of simply restating that the trip was life-changing, reiterate your transformed view of the American landscape and its personal significance. Briefly touch upon what you intend to *do* with this newfound appreciation in the future.

**Example of Incorporating Feedback (Revised Conclusion):**

"I knew going into this trip that it would be life-changing, but I did not realize fully that it would change me in so many unexpected ways. I will forever cherish that summer I spent on my bike, exploring the natural world that we hold so separate from day-to-day modern life. Although we were pedaling on man-made roads and bridges, this experience provided me with an invaluable experience of the amazing nature that can be found all across the country, if you only take the time to notice it. More than just a physical journey, this bike trip forged within me a lasting bond with the American landscape, one that I intend to nurture by advocating for sustainable practices and encouraging others to seek their own unique connections with the natural world."

**In Summary:**

This is a strong essay with a lot of potential. By adding a more explicit thesis, digging deeper into the analysis of your transformation, and making a few minor revisions, you can elevate it to an even higher level. The core of the essay – your genuine experience and thoughtful reflections – is already very compelling. Good job!
