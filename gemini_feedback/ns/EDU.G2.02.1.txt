Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The paper has a clear argument: that Greg Michie's *Holler if You Hear Me* offers valuable insights into education reform and provides a more hopeful perspective than Noguera's *City Schools*.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure: introduction with thesis, discussion of specific insights from Michie (student voice, impact of external factors, caring teachers), contrast with Noguera, and conclusion.
*   **Specific Examples:** The paper effectively uses specific examples from the text (*Holler if You Hear Me*) and relevant quotes to support its claims (the Tavares analogy, Hector's gang experience, Marisa's classroom comments).
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The paper goes beyond simple summary and demonstrates insightful analysis of the texts, connecting them to broader issues of education reform and relating the insights to the writer's own aspirations as a future educator.
*   **Coherent Voice:** The writing voice is consistent, academic, and engaging. The first-person perspective is used effectively without being overbearing or detracting from the argument.
*   **Proper Citations:** The paper uses proper citations throughout.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Comparison with Noguera:** While the contrast with Noguera provides a framing device, the paper could benefit from a more thorough analysis of Noguera's arguments. More elaboration on *why* Noguera's approach seems less hopeful would strengthen the contrast.
*   **Nuance in the "Hopefulness" Argument:** The paper heavily emphasizes "hopefulness." While this is a valid angle, consider acknowledging potential limitations of Michie's approach or complexities within the idea of hope itself.  Are there downsides to focusing solely on individual-level successes?  Does Noguera's approach have strengths that Michie's lacks?
*   **Contextualization:** It could be helpful to offer more context about the settings and students each author discusses. Understanding the specific schools and communities involved would provide a richer understanding of the issues being addressed.
*   **Expanding on Reform Suggestions:** The paper touches on how Michie's insights could inform reform (mentorship programs, smaller class sizes), but these suggestions could be more developed. Explore potential challenges, implementation details, or possible counterarguments.
*   **Minor Edits/Proofreading:** A close reading for minor grammatical and stylistic issues could improve the paper's overall polish.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Noguera Deep Dive:** Devote more space to Noguera. Instead of just contrasting "hopefulness," analyze the *specific* policies and arguments Noguera proposes. Why are they less practical or inspiring to the author? Perhaps Noguera's solutions are top-down, while Michie's seem more bottom-up and personal.

    *   Example: "While Noguera advocates for [Specific Policy, e.g., increased parental involvement programs], such initiatives can be difficult to implement in communities where families face significant economic or social barriers. Michie's focus on individual student relationships, while perhaps not scalable to a district-wide level, offers a more immediately actionable approach for individual teachers."
*   **Address Limitations:** Acknowledge the potential downsides of focusing only on the micro-level. "While Michie's emphasis on individual student relationships is inspiring, it's important to acknowledge that addressing systemic issues such as funding disparities and discriminatory policies also requires broader, top-down reforms."

*   **Elaborate on Reform Suggestions:**  Don't just mention mentorship and smaller class sizes.  Explore *how* these could be implemented.  "Implementing mentorship programs could involve partnerships with local businesses, community organizations, and university student volunteers. Careful training and ongoing support for mentors would be essential to ensure program effectiveness."

*   **Sentence Variation:** Vary sentence structure to add interest and rhythm.
*   **Avoid Overuse of "That":**  Look for instances where "that" can be removed without changing the meaning.
*   **Proofread:** Carefully proofread the final draft for any remaining errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

**Revised Example incorporating some suggestions:**

"These insights that Michie offers in *Holler* leave me feeling more hopeful about meaningful school reform than do the solutions offered by Pedro Noguera in *City Schools and the American Dream*. Noguera's broader, systemic approach, while valuable in addressing issues such as funding disparities and policy inequities, sometimes feels overwhelming. For instance, his call for educators to move beyond critique and propose alternative policies for addressing violence (Noguera, 2003, p. 131) feels daunting to a pre-service teacher. While systemic change is necessary, Michie's more personal and immediate strategies, such as fostering student voice and building strong teacher-student relationships, seem like achievable first steps. However, *Holler*’s focus on individual successes could inadvertently overshadow the systemic issues at play.  Therefore, it’s vital to recognize that broader, top-down reforms are equally essential to dismantling discriminatory policies and ensuring equitable resources.  Ultimately, a combination of micro-level interventions, such as mentorship programs and reduced class sizes, and macro-level policies, such as equitable school funding models, are required to make education reform effective."

**In summary:** This is a well-written and insightful paper. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can further strengthen your argument and make your paper even more compelling. Good work!
