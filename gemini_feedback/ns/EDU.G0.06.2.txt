Okay, I can provide some feedback on this paper. Here's a breakdown of its strengths, areas for improvement, and some specific suggestions:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Structure:** The paper has a clear thesis: that the writer has significantly grown in their ability to attend to and commit to the learning and achievement of all students, especially regarding equity. The chronological structure, tracing the development of this understanding through specific assignments, is effective.
*   **Specific Examples:** The paper effectively uses specific examples from the writer's notebook and classroom experiences to illustrate their growth. This is crucial for demonstrating genuine learning and reflection.
*   **Demonstrates Growth and Reflection:** The writer shows a genuine process of learning, acknowledging initial assumptions and how they changed over time. The reflection is thoughtful and insightful.
*   **Focus on Equity:** The paper consistently addresses the importance of equity and how to create a more equitable learning environment. This focus is admirable and relevant to contemporary educational discourse.
*   **Practical Application:** The paper goes beyond theoretical understanding and shows how the writer applied new knowledge to lesson planning and classroom practices.
*   **Strong Conclusion:** The conclusion effectively summarizes the writer's growth and articulates their future commitment to creating an equitable classroom.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis (Potential):** While the paper provides a good overview of the writer's learning, some sections could benefit from a deeper analysis of the *why* behind the observed issues and solutions.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Some sentences are a bit lengthy and could be more concise. Aim for clarity and directness in writing.
*   **Flow and Transitions:** While the structure is logical, improving the transitions between different assignments and ideas could enhance the flow of the paper.

**Specific Suggestions and Examples:**

1.  **Depth of Analysis:**

    *   **Example:** When discussing the initial thought that math is a "universal language," consider adding a sentence or two about *why* that assumption is problematic. You could mention that even in math, the context and presentation of problems can create barriers for some students.
    *   **Example:** When discussing differentiating instruction, explain more fully *why* pairing students of different abilities is beneficial for both the stronger and the weaker student. What specific skills or understandings are developed?
    *   **Example:** Go one step deeper with the mini-problem discussion. You mentioned "I also provided a problem that was not situated in a context with which some students might be unfamiliar." Elaborate on the *impact* of using a contextualized (familiar) problem, and conversely, the impact of using a context unfamiliar to some learners.

2.  **Clarity and Conciseness:**

    *   **Original:** "This is an important step in committing to the learning and achievement of all students, as a supportive classroom environment must not favor some students over others."
    *   **Revised:** "This is a crucial step toward equitable learning, as a supportive environment ensures that all students are valued equally."
    *   **Original:** "When analyzing the fourth grade Everyday Math lesson about comparing and ordering decimals, I was able to consider how the tasks do or do not support the learning of all students and how the context may affect individual students."
    *   **Revised:** "Analyzing the fourth-grade Everyday Math lesson on decimals, I considered how the tasks supported or hindered all students' learning and how the context affected individuals."

3.  **Flow and Transitions:**

    *   Use transition words and phrases to connect different ideas and assignments more smoothly.
    *   **Example:** "Building upon the previous assignment,..." or "In contrast to my initial perspective,..." or "As I progressed to the next assignment,..."
    *   Provide a brief summary sentence at the end of a paragraph to link it to the next one. For example, at the end of the paragraph on the second class assignment, you could say: "This focus on classroom community was a step in the right direction, but I still needed to consider how the problems themselves might present obstacles to some students."

4. **Introduction/Conclusion**
    *   *Consider more specific opening hook:* Instead of starting with the generic, "Over the semester, I have..." Try to be more specific right off the bat in the introduction, maybe give an example of an inequity that you witnessed in a classroom as a means to grab the readers' attention right away.
    *   *Stronger closing statement:* The conclusion is really good, but the very last sentence, "My classroom will not be a classroom where teaching practices reproduce inequalities but a classroom where the teacher considers the equity of all students in daily decisions," can be phrased in a way that ends the paper with a bang. Maybe add something that will be *proactive* about reducing inequality instead of just considering it. For example: "My classroom will become a place where every student's unique background is uplifted and valued through equitable practices which level the playing field for future success."

**Revised example using suggestions from above:**

"Initially, I approached teaching math believing it was a universal language. (Start hook here. An example: I once witnessed a classroom where only students from affluent families could grasp geometry because the teacher only used mansions as example houses.) However, throughout this semester, I've significantly grown to realize my error and develop a deeper ability to ensure commitment and achievement for all students. I've become aware of inequities and committed to mitigating them in my lessons.

In my first class assignment (page eight), I focused on what students know, state requirements, teaching methods, and learning outcomes. However, I didn't think about differentiating to reach *each* student, which is a step towards leveling the playing field. I thought math was a universal language to which all students have equal access.

Building upon the previous assignment, I then learned (page fourteen) to consider building a classroom community where students explore ideas and take risks in a supportive environment. This is a crucial step toward equitable learning, as a supportive environment ensures that all students are valued equally. Race, gender, and ability should *not* affect how others or I treat students. However, I still didn't consider how problems may hinder students from achieving.

During my mini-problem, I supported all students by calling on a majority and publicly valuing their contributions. For instance, I used, "So you agree with Emily." Also, I provided a problem with which some students may be unfamiliar. This ensured access to the math at hand.

Analyzing a fourth-grade Everyday Math lesson on decimals, I considered how the tasks supported or hindered all students' learning and how the context affected individuals. For example, I saw how pennies as context may be a concept that not all students were familiar with.

My skills in analysis stepped up when I was planning my lesson to avoid issues of inequality. In particular, I looked at the knowledge that students were assumed to have. I wanted to make sure that all students were on board with the vocabulary and concepts to be discussed. I also wanted to support all students during the discussion. I called on boy-girl-boy-girl to ensure equality between genders, and I called on students of a wide range of abilities. I also supported students' acquisition of "tessellation" by connecting it to what they already knew (tiling, etc.)

Overall, I've made progress to equity in the classroom. I began the semester without any thought of equity, but then started considering practices that would help my students learn, such as strategically pairing students, using multiple representations, and creating a supportive environment. Nearing the end, I was able to recognize biased contexts and to support equal participation in my discussions.

I ended this semester being able to analyze strengths and weaknesses relating to equity and adapt the lesson to address all students' learning.

My classroom will become a place where every student's unique background is uplifted and valued through equitable practices which level the playing field for future success."

**In summary:**

The paper is already quite good. By adding more depth of analysis, improving clarity and flow, the paper will be even more compelling and demonstrate a stronger understanding of the complexities of equity in education.
