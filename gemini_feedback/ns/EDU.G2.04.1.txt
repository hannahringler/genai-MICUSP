Here's some feedback on the paper, covering strengths and areas for potential improvement.

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The paper clearly argues that a connectionist model of literacy is incomplete because it neglects the essential sociocultural dimensions.
*   **Strong Theoretical Grounding:** The paper effectively integrates and applies key concepts from sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, Gee, Bakhtin, Rosenblatt) to critique the connectionist view.
*   **Well-Supported Claims:** The paper supports its claims with relevant research and specific examples. The quotations are used effectively to illustrate and reinforce your points.
*   **Thoughtful Analysis:** You demonstrate a deep understanding of the theoretical perspectives being discussed, and you engage in thoughtful analysis by questioning the limitations of the connectionist model.
*   **Personal Voice and Engagement:** The paper includes a personal voice, especially evident in the last paragraph, which describes the author's fascination with the topic.
*   **Clear Organization:** The paper is well-organized, progressing logically from the description of the connectionist model to the critique and alternative perspective. The introduction and conclusion effectively frame the argument.
*   **Proper Citations:** The citations appear to be thorough and accurate.

**Areas for Potential Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Engagement with Byrnes (2001):** While you criticize Byrnes's view, consider engaging with him more specifically on his own terms. For example:

    *   Does Byrnes acknowledge sociocultural influences at all, even if he doesn't prioritize them? If so, where and how?
    *   What are Byrnes's specific claims about the benefits of the connectionist model? How does your sociocultural perspective address those benefits, or offer alternative explanations?
*   **Further Elaboration of the Alternative Model:** You introduce the idea of concentric circles (Immediate Social Context and Larger Sociocultural Context) surrounding the connectionist model. This is a promising idea! It could benefit from further elaboration:

    *   What specific elements would be included in each of these contexts?
    *   How would these contexts interact with the cognitive processors in the connectionist model?
    *   How would this expanded model better account for literacy development?
*   **More Concrete Examples:** While you provide examples from the literature, consider including more concrete examples of how sociocultural factors influence literacy practices in specific contexts. For example:

    *   How do different families/communities approach shared reading or writing?
    *   How do cultural norms influence the interpretation of texts?

*   **Nuance and Acknowledgment of Complexity:** While advocating for a sociocultural perspective, acknowledging that cognitive processes *are* important, and that purely sociocultural perspectives might also have limitations, can strengthen your argument by demonstrating critical thinking.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Paragraph 2: "And it is important to emphasize that it is for the *individual*. This model of literacy..."** This feels a little repetitive. Consider rewording to streamline the sentence and make the point more concise. Maybe: "A key emphasis of the model is that reading comprehension is an individual process."
*   **Paragraph 4: "...as it constructs reading as an act of cognition, or a “complex collection of skills” which reside within the individual *alone.*"** Adding "alone" is a good choice.
*   **Page 4: the author gives only *one paragraph* to cultural differences in literacy;** Add emphasis
*   **Page 4: While Byrnes *does* give limited discussion...** Add emphasis
*   **Page 5: Consider the word *interconnectedness***. Consider a different word choice as interconnections is repeated.

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that effectively critiques a specific model of literacy and advocates for a more comprehensive, sociocultural perspective. By addressing the areas for potential improvement, you can further strengthen your argument and make your paper even more compelling.
