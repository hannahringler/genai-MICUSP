Okay, here's some feedback on the paper.  I'll focus on both its strengths and weaknesses, and try to offer suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Structure:** The paper starts with a clear thesis statement outlining the comparison between Hegel and Marx regarding social division, social change, and the state. The structure follows logically from this thesis, comparing their views on these three key areas.
*   **Solid Understanding of the Theories:** The paper demonstrates a good grasp of the core concepts of both Hegel and Marx. It accurately represents their arguments about the desire for recognition (Hegel), class conflict (Marx), the role of labor, and the nature of the state.
*   **Effective Use of Quotations:** The paper effectively uses quotations from the primary sources to support its claims. The quotations are well-chosen and relevant to the points being made.
*   **Clear and Concise Writing:** The writing style is generally clear and concise, making it easy to follow the argument.

**Areas for Improvement and Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Deeper Analysis and Comparison:** While the paper effectively summarizes and contrasts the views of Hegel and Marx, it could benefit from a deeper analysis and comparison of their ideas. For example, instead of simply stating that Marx challenges Hegel's idealism, you could explore the specific points of contention and the philosophical implications of their differing perspectives.
    *   **How are their philosophical frameworks radically different?** How does a materialist view of history differ from an idealist one? How does this impact their understanding of the state's function?
    *   **How do their assumptions about human nature differ?** How does this lead them to different ideas about social division?
*   **Original Interpretation and Argumentation:** While the paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the material, it could be strengthened by adding more original interpretation and argumentation. For example, you could offer your own perspective on the relative strengths and weaknesses of their theories, or explore the implications of their ideas for contemporary social and political issues.
    *   **The "So What?" Factor:** Who are the debates and topics these ideas are informing? Does it influence policy? Does it influence our understanding of social movements? What makes their ideas important today?
    *   **Be careful not to take sides, but also be confident.** You clearly know the material; so express why you see these issues as being important.
*   **Further Development of Specific Points:**
    *   **Hegel's Idea of the State:** You could expand on Hegel's view of the state as the culmination of reason and freedom. What are the potential criticisms of this view?
    *   **Marx's Critique of Alienation:** You could explore the concept of alienation in more detail, including its various dimensions and its implications for human well-being.
    *   **The Role of Material Conditions:** You could discuss the role of material conditions in shaping social consciousness, and how this differs from Hegel's emphasis on the development of the human spirit.
*   **Consider the Historical Context:** While touched upon, consider exploring the historical context in which Hegel and Marx were writing. How did the social, economic, and political conditions of their time influence their ideas?
*   **Minor Points:**
    *   Consistency of Citation: Ensure consistency in your citation style.
    *   Proofread Carefully: Review the paper carefully for any grammatical errors or typos.

**Example of More Detailed Analysis:**

Instead of:

> For Marx, it is class conflict that is the central axis of social division.

You could write something like:

> Marx identifies class conflict, rooted in the material conditions of production, as the central axis of social division. This directly challenges Hegel's emphasis on the desire for recognition as the primary driver of social change. While Hegel sees the master-slave dialectic as a process of spiritual development leading to self-consciousness, Marx views the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat as a struggle for economic power, with the exploitation of labor at its core. The key difference lies in their philosophical starting points: Hegel's idealism prioritizes consciousness, while Marx's materialism emphasizes the importance of material conditions in shaping human relations and social structures. This leads to fundamentally different understandings of how social change occurs and the role of the state in society.

**In Summary:**

This is a well-written and informative paper that demonstrates a solid understanding of the theories of Hegel and Marx. By adding more in-depth analysis, original interpretation, and specific examples, you can further strengthen the paper and elevate it to a higher level of scholarship. Keep developing that analysis!
