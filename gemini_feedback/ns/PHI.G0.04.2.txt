Okay, I can provide feedback on this philosophy paper. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of Ayer's and Stevenson's expressivist theories and identifies potential problems with their accounts of moral education and moral discourse. The writing is generally clear and well-organized. However, the argumentation could be sharper, more focused, and more thoroughly supported. The paper could also benefit from a clearer thesis statement early on.

**Strengths**

*   **Understanding of the Theories:** The paper accurately summarizes Ayer's and Stevenson's core arguments regarding ethical language and the expression of moral sentiments.
*   **Identification of Problems:** The paper correctly points out the difficulties expressivism faces in explaining moral education and the possibility of meaningful moral disagreement.
*   **Clear Writing:** The prose is generally easy to follow, and the structure is logical.
*   **Engagement with Primary Sources:** The paper references and quotes the relevant texts from Ayer and Stevenson.
*   **Structure:** The paper generally has a logical flow, progressing from summarizing Ayer's view to critiquing it and then to examining Stevenson's attempt to refine it.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Lack of a Clear Thesis Statement:** The paper doesn't present a concise thesis statement in the introduction. The reader isn't immediately aware of the central argument or the conclusion the paper intends to reach.
*   **Argumentative Depth:** The paper identifies weaknesses in expressivism but doesn't always develop these criticisms with sufficient depth and supporting evidence.
*   **Elaboration and Examples:** The paper often makes assertions without providing concrete examples or detailed explanations to support them.
*   **Over-Reliance on Summary:** At times, the paper seems to focus more on summarizing the views of Ayer and Stevenson than on critically evaluating them.
*   **Vagueness and Ambiguity:** Some statements are too vague or ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
*   **Structure and Organization:** While generally good, some transitions could be smoother, and the overall structure could be tightened to improve focus.
*   **Ad Hominem:** The line "A. J. Ayer arrogantly proclaims..." is unnecessary and weakens the paper. It's better to focus on the argument itself rather than making personal judgments about the author.

**Specific Suggestions**

1.  **Introduce a Clear Thesis Statement Early:**

    *   Revise the introduction to include a clear, concise thesis statement that outlines the paper's main argument. For example: "This paper argues that while Ayer's and Stevenson's expressivist theories provide valuable insights into the nature of moral language, they ultimately fail to adequately account for the possibility of meaningful moral education and rational moral disagreement, particularly in their limited explanation of how moral principles are formed and evaluated."
2.  **Deepen the Criticism of Expressivism:**

    *   **Expand on the Callatians Example:** Elaborate on how the Callatians example highlights the limitations of expressivism. Explore the potential cultural and historical factors that might contribute to their moral attitudes, and explain why simply labeling it as a difference in "moral sentiments" is insufficient.
    *   **Address Potential Expressivist Rebuttals:** Anticipate and respond to potential counterarguments that Ayer or Stevenson might make. For example, how might they explain the persistence of moral disagreement even after all the facts are known?
    *   **Elaborate on the Formation of Moral Principles:** Develop the argument that expressivism struggles to explain the formation and evaluation of moral principles. Provide specific examples of how people engage in rational deliberation about moral issues and how they might revise their moral beliefs based on new information or arguments.
3.  **Strengthen the Argument about Moral Education:**

    *   **Define Moral Education More Precisely:** Clarify what you mean by "moral education." Is it simply the transmission of existing moral beliefs, or does it also involve critical reflection and the development of independent moral reasoning skills?
    *   **Explain How Systems of Value are Developed:** Elaborate on the idea that moral education should help students develop systems of value. How does this process work? What are the key elements of a well-developed system of value?
    *   **Distinguish Disagreement on Principles Versus Applications:** The paper could be strengthened by considering disagreements about the *application* of moral principles versus disagreements about the principles themselves. Ayer and Stevenson's account might be more plausible for explaining disagreements of application.
4.  **Provide More Concrete Examples:**

    *   Illustrate abstract concepts with concrete examples. For instance, when discussing the "refinement" of moral attitudes, provide an example of how someone might change their moral beliefs in response to new information or experiences.
5.  **Clarify Vague Statements:**

    *   Replace ambiguous language with more precise terms. For example, instead of saying that expressivism is "too limiting," explain exactly what limitations it faces and why those limitations are problematic.
6.  **Improve Transitions:**

    *   Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and ensure a smooth flow of argumentation. For example, "However," "Furthermore," "In contrast," "Therefore," etc.
7.  **Remove Unnecessary Phrases and Opinions:**

    *   Delete phrases that add little to the argument, such as "A. J. Ayer arrogantly proclaims." Focus on the substance of the arguments, not on personal opinions.
8.  **Proofread Carefully:**

    *   Carefully proofread the paper for grammatical errors, typos, and stylistic inconsistencies.

**Revised Introduction Example (with thesis statement)**

"A. J. Ayer, in *Language, Truth and Logic*, argues that ethical concepts are merely expressions of emotion, lacking cognitive content. Similarly, Charles Leslie Stevenson, in "The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms," emphasizes the persuasive function of moral statements. While these expressivist theories offer valuable insights into the subjective nature of moral judgments, they face significant challenges in explaining moral education and rational moral disagreement. *This paper argues that while Ayer's and Stevenson's expressivist theories provide valuable insights into the nature of moral language, they ultimately fail to adequately account for the possibility of meaningful moral education and rational moral disagreement, particularly in their limited explanation of how moral principles are formed and evaluated.*  This essay will first outline Ayer's core claims, then explore the problems expressivism has in accounting for moral education, using the example of Herodotus's account of the Greeks and Callatians. Finally, I will examine Stevenson's refinement of Ayer's view and demonstrate why it still does not adequately address these limitations."

By addressing these weaknesses and incorporating these suggestions, you can significantly strengthen your philosophy paper and make a more persuasive argument. Let me know if you have any specific questions about these suggestions!
