Okay, I can give you some feedback on this paper based on a read-through.  I'll focus on areas like argument clarity, evidence usage, organization, and style.

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a sophisticated and insightful reading of Stephen Dedalus's character in *Ulysses*, particularly focusing on the "Proteus" chapter. The central argument – that Stephen uses a series of alternative identities to deconstruct himself and cope with anxieties related to family, artistic ambition, and Irish heritage – is compelling and well-developed. The writing is generally strong, demonstrating a solid grasp of literary analysis. However, the paper could benefit from a few refinements to enhance its clarity and impact.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Central Argument:** The thesis is clear, focused, and arguable. It provides a lens through which to examine Stephen's complex character.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The paper demonstrates a deep understanding of *Ulysses* and its themes. The interpretations of Stephen's thoughts and actions are well-reasoned and supported by textual evidence.
*   **Effective Use of Textual Evidence:** The paper consistently uses quotes from *Ulysses* (and *Portrait*) to illustrate and support its claims. The chosen quotes are relevant and well-integrated into the analysis.
*   **Sophisticated Vocabulary and Style:** The writing is articulate and demonstrates a strong command of language.
*   **Clear Structure:** The paper is organized logically, with each paragraph focusing on a specific aspect of the argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Accessibility:** At times, the language and sentence structure can be dense and complex, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument. While sophistication is admirable, prioritizing clarity will make the analysis more impactful.
    *   **Example:** "Stephen categorically resists mulling over the one aspect of his environment that would seem to matter to him the most: himself." Could be rephrased for conciseness.
*   **Connecting to broader implications:** The paper could benefit from a stronger conclusion that draws out the broader implications of Stephen's identity deconstruction. What does this say about Joyce's project, modernism, or the nature of identity itself?

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Consider adding a sentence or two that contextualizes the importance of identity in *Ulysses* or in modernist literature more broadly. This would provide a stronger framework for your specific argument.

2.  **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   **Topic Sentences:** Ensure that each paragraph begins with a clear topic sentence that directly relates to the main argument and indicates the specific focus of that paragraph.
    *   **Explanation and Analysis:** While you provide plenty of textual evidence, sometimes the analysis could be expanded. Explain *why* a particular quote is significant or how it directly supports your claim. Don't assume the reader will make the connection.
    *   **Address Counterarguments (briefly):** In some cases, acknowledging alternative interpretations or potential counterarguments could strengthen your analysis. This shows that you've considered other perspectives.
    *   **Example (Paragraph 2):** You could briefly acknowledge the possibility that Stephen's feelings toward his family might be exaggerated or distorted by his own insecurities.
    *   **Example (Paragraph 3):** You could also briefly show how his family ties contribute to his anxiety.
    *   **Transitional Phrases:** Strengthen the connections between paragraphs by using transitional phrases to guide the reader through your argument.
    *   **Paragraph on Stephen and Swift:** It would also improve the structure if there was a clear transition point from the analysis on Stephen's family, and his analysis on his artistic ambition.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Avoid simply summarizing your argument. Instead, use the conclusion to:
        *   **Synthesize your findings:** Briefly restate your main argument in a new and insightful way.
        *   **Discuss broader implications:** What are the larger implications of Stephen's identity deconstruction? How does it relate to the themes of the novel, modernism, or the human condition?
        *   **Suggest further avenues of inquiry:** What questions remain unanswered? What other aspects of Stephen's character or *Ulysses* could be explored in relation to your argument?

4.  **Style:**
    *   **Vary Sentence Structure:** While your writing is sophisticated, consider varying sentence structure to improve readability. Mix shorter, more direct sentences with longer, more complex ones.
    *   **Conciseness:** Look for opportunities to condense your writing and eliminate unnecessary words or phrases.

**Revised Examples:**

*   **Original:** "Stephen categorically resists mulling over the one aspect of his environment that would seem to matter to him the most: himself."
*   **Revised:** "Paradoxically, Stephen avoids direct contemplation of himself, despite the introspective nature of his surroundings."
*   **Original:** “Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me" (3.6-9).
*   **Revised:** "In a moment of self-reflection, Stephen admits that his ancestors’ barbaric instincts and violent tendencies course through his veins ('Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves...'), illustrating how he can never fully disassociate himself from his Irish heritage."

By addressing these points, you can elevate your paper from a strong analysis to a truly compelling and insightful exploration of Stephen Dedalus's character.
