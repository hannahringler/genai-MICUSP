Okay, I've read through the essay and can provide some feedback. Here's a breakdown of strengths and areas for improvement, along with some specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The essay presents a clear and insightful argument comparing Hermia and Jessica's defiance of their fathers. It demonstrates a good understanding of both plays and uses textual evidence effectively. The writing is generally clear and well-organized.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The essay establishes a clear thesis in the introduction, outlining the comparison between Hermia and Jessica and arguing that Jessica is initially more successful in defying her father but ultimately less happy.
*   **Strong Textual Evidence:** The essay supports its claims with relevant and well-chosen quotations from both *A Midsummer Night's Dream* and *The Merchant of Venice*.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The essay offers insightful interpretations of the characters' motivations and actions, going beyond simple plot summary. For example, the analysis of Jessica's relationship with Shylock and her conversion to Christianity is particularly strong.
*   **Well-Organized:** The essay follows a logical structure, with each paragraph focusing on a specific aspect of the comparison.
*   **Good Use of Definitions:** The essay effectively uses the Oxford English Dictionary definition of "defy" to frame the argument.
*   **Sophisticated Argument:** The essay develops a nuanced argument, considering different ways to measure "successful defiance" and ultimately concluding that happiness is a better measure than the degree of rebellion.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Refine Thesis Statement:** The current thesis is good, but it could be even stronger. Consider adding a touch more nuance to indicate *why* Hermia's "less severe approach" is ultimately more successful.
*   **Address Counterarguments (More Directly):** While the essay touches on counterarguments, making these explicit and rebutting them directly can strengthen your position. For example, you could acknowledge that Jessica *appears* more liberated initially, but then explain why this is ultimately a facade.
*   **Deeper Exploration of Hermia's Motivation:** The essay focuses more on Jessica's motivations. Consider exploring Hermia's desires more deeply. Is she simply rebelling against her father's choice, or is there a deeper reason she is drawn to Lysander?
*   **Concluding Strength:** The conclusion summarizes your argument well. However, you could elevate it by adding a final thought that connects your analysis to a broader theme, like the complexities of family relationships, or the consequences of rebellion.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Consider adding a brief sentence or two at the very beginning to set the stage. This could involve a general statement about parental authority in Shakespearean plays, or a brief overview of the plays.
    *   Make your thesis statement as clear and impactful as possible. For example: "While Jessica initially appears to achieve a more complete rebellion against her father Shylock than Hermia does against Egeus, her actions lead to a less fulfilling outcome, demonstrating that true defiance lies not in the severity of the act but in the resulting happiness."
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   **Paragraph on Jessica's negative relationship:** Expand slightly on what makes Shylock distasteful other than being Jewish. Are there specific behaviors or personality traits?
    *   **Paragraph on Hermia's motivation:** Consider adding a sentence or two that explores why Hermia may favor Lysander over Demetrius. What qualities does she see in him?
    *   **Paragraph on ring:** Explore further why the ring is symbolic to Shylock.
    *   **Strengthen Transitions:** Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and guide the reader.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   The last sentence, "Ultimately, if success is to be associated with happiness and not the degree of defiance, one must conclude that less is more," is a good summary. However, consider adding a sentence that broadens the significance of your analysis. For example, you could say something like: "Ultimately, the contrasting fates of Hermia and Jessica reveal the importance of carefully considering the consequences of rebellion, suggesting that genuine happiness is often found not in radical defiance but in pursuing one's desires with greater discernment."
*   **Minor Edits:**
    *   "distain" should be "disdain"
    *   "A fair assumption may be that she is unhappy about being born a Jew and that she resents her father for passing on Judaism to her" can be reworded for clarity, perhaps: "It can be assumed that part of her unhappiness may stem from being a Jew, because of the anti-semitic sentiments in Venice."

**Revised Conclusion (Example)**
"After close inspection of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and A Merchant of Venice, it becomes clear that both Jessica and Hermia are successful at defying their fathers in different ways. If successful defiance is measured by greater rebellion and cruelty, Jessica certainly wins. However, if the daughter's happiness at the end of each play is a better measure for successful defiance, then Hermia's less severe approach achieves more. Ultimately, if success is to be associated with happiness and not the degree of defiance, one must conclude that less is more. Ultimately, the contrasting fates of Hermia and Jessica reveal the complexities of navigating familial expectations, suggesting that true liberation lies not merely in radical acts of rebellion, but in the considered pursuit of one's own happiness and well-being."

By addressing these areas, you can further strengthen your essay and make it even more persuasive and insightful.
