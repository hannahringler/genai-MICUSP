Okay, here's some feedback on the paper "Investing the Learning Technologies," focusing on its strengths and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a clear and compelling argument for investing in computers in schools. It's well-organized, uses evidence to support its claims, and is generally well-written. The arguments are logically presented, and the language is appropriate for an academic essay.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The introductory paragraph clearly states the author's position: a millage should be proposed to fund new computers for the school.
*   **Well-Organized:** The essay follows a logical structure.  Each paragraph focuses on a specific benefit of technology in education.
*   **Evidence-Based:** The paper cites research to support its claims. References to Bransford, Brown, and Cocking, Blasewitz and Taylor, and Slavin add credibility.
*   **Specific Examples:** The inclusion of examples like the Belvedere system and the Peabody Learning Lab helps to illustrate the points being made. The mention of Global Lab is a strong example.
*   **Focus on Benefits:** The paper effectively highlights the positive impacts of technology on individualized instruction, student achievement, motivation, and access to real-world problems.
*   **Clarity of Writing:** The essay is generally easy to understand and well-written. The language is appropriate for an academic setting.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **More Specificity in Introduction:** While the thesis is clear, the introduction could be more engaging.  Consider starting with a hook that captures the reader's attention (e.g., a statistic about technology use in schools, a brief anecdote about the current situation in River Valley, or a provocative question about educational equity).  You might also briefly mention the key benefits to be discussed in the essay.
*   **Deeper Explanation of Research:** The paper would benefit from a slightly more in-depth explanation of *why* the cited research supports the author's claims.  Instead of just stating that a study showed improvement, briefly explain the study's design or key findings.
*   **Acknowledge Counterarguments/Limitations:** To make the argument even stronger, acknowledge potential counterarguments or limitations. For example:
    *   **Cost:** Address the potential high cost of purchasing and maintaining new computers. Suggest possible funding strategies beyond a millage, or argue that the long-term benefits outweigh the initial investment.
    *   **Teacher Training:** Mention the need for teacher training to effectively integrate technology into the curriculum. This shows that you've considered the holistic approach needed for success.
    *   **Distraction:** Acknowledge the potential for distractions and misuse of technology. Suggest strategies to minimize these risks (e.g., clear guidelines, monitoring software).
    *   **Digital Divide:** Briefly address the issue of equitable access to technology *outside* of school.  If some students lack computers at home, the school's investment might only partially address the problem.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is a bit weak. It essentially summarizes the arguments, but doesn't provide a strong call to action or leave the reader with a lasting impression.
    *   **Reinforce Thesis:** Restate the main argument in a fresh way.
    *   **Call to Action:** Urge the school board to act decisively and implement the proposed millage.
    *   **Future Vision:** Paint a picture of what the River Valley schools could look like with enhanced technology.
*   **Citation Format:**  The citation style seems inconsistent (sometimes year in parentheses, sometimes not).  Ensure that all citations adhere to a consistent style (APA, MLA, etc.) throughout the paper.
*   **Typos/Proofreading:** Carefully proofread for any minor grammatical errors or typos.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**  "Imagine a classroom where every student has access to personalized learning materials, can explore complex concepts through interactive simulations, and collaborate with experts around the world.  This vision can become a reality for River Valley schools by investing in new learning technologies.  This essay will argue that the River Valley school board should propose a millage to fund the purchase of new computers, as this investment will promote student achievement, enhance engagement, and provide access to invaluable real-world experiences."
*   **Teacher Training Paragraph (if added):** "The successful implementation of technology requires adequate teacher training.  Teachers need to be equipped with the skills and knowledge to effectively integrate computers into their lessons, design engaging activities, and provide technical support to students."
*   **Conclusion:** "Investing in computers is not simply about buying new hardware; it's about investing in the future of River Valley's students. By providing access to these powerful learning tools, we can empower them to become critical thinkers, creative problem-solvers, and engaged citizens of the 21st century.  The River Valley school board should seize this opportunity and propose a millage that will transform our schools and prepare our students for success. Let us equip them with the tools they need to thrive, not just survive, in an increasingly complex and technology-driven world."

**Overall Grade (Estimate):**

Based on the strengths and weaknesses, I would estimate this paper to be in the B+ to A- range. Addressing the points above would likely raise it to the A range.

By addressing these points, you can make your argument even more persuasive and impactful. Good luck!
