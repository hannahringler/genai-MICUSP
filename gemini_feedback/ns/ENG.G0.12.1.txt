Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-argued and well-supported essay that makes a convincing case for the power of women in *Beowulf*.  It goes beyond a superficial reading of the text and offers a nuanced analysis of Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother.  The structure is logical, and the writing is generally clear.

**Strengths:**

*   **Strong Thesis and Argument:** The central argument that women in *Beowulf* possess significant power, albeit manifested differently than that of men, is clear and well-maintained throughout the essay. The thesis evolves and clarifies throughout the paper.
*   **Detailed Textual Analysis:** You effectively use textual evidence (quotes) to support your claims. You interpret the quotes carefully and explain their significance in relation to your argument.
*   **Nuanced Understanding of Context:** You demonstrate an awareness of the social and cultural context of *Beowulf*.  You recognize that Wealhtheow's actions, though seemingly submissive, are actually strategic and crucial for maintaining social order.
*   **Counterargument and Rebuttal:** The essay anticipates potential counterarguments (e.g., that the women are dominated by men) and effectively rebuts them with textual evidence and insightful analysis. The paper acknowledges Beowulf kills Grendel's mother, however it clearly demonstrates the contributions of women and the aid Beowulf needed in order to be victorious.
*   **Clear Structure:** The essay has a logical flow. It introduces the argument, analyzes Wealhtheow's power, then Grendel's mother, and concludes by reiterating the central claim and highlighting the subtlety of the women's power.
*   **Clear and Concise Writing:** The writing is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well-constructed, and vocabulary is appropriate.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Expand on the "Why" (Significance):**  While you do a good job of showing *how* the women exert power, consider expanding on *why* this is significant. What does it tell us about the poem's overall themes?  What commentary does it give about gender? What can modern readers learn from the story? Are the men blind to the manipulation or is it clear? This is particularly relevant in the conclusion.
*   **Explore Potential Limitations or Complexities:** No argument is perfect.  Are there any limitations to your interpretation? Are there instances where the women's power seems less effective or more constrained? Acknowledging these complexities can strengthen your argument by showing that you've considered alternative viewpoints.
*   **Refine Tone and Word Choice:** At times, the tone is a little informal. For example, in the first paragraph, "This modern mindset may influence a reader's perception..." is acceptable, but could be reworded for greater impact "the modern reader's perception may be influenced..."
*   **Clarity and Flow:**
    *   Be sure that paragraphs have strong topic sentences that clearly indicate the main point of the paragraph.
    *   Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and guide the reader.
*   **Proofreading:** Give the essay a final proofread to catch any minor grammatical or typographical errors.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** The introduction is a bit broad. Consider focusing more directly on the poem itself and the specific ideas you'll be exploring. The statement about modern society isn't necessary to the paper.
*   **Wealhtheow:** The analysis of Wealhtheow is strong. Continue to highlight the subtle ways in which she wields influence.
*   **Grendel's Mother:** The comparison between Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother is insightful. Expand on this a bit. How does their power differ, and what does that say about their roles in the poem?
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion could be more impactful. Instead of simply summarizing the argument, consider offering a final thought or implication. Address the significance of the women's power in relation to the poem as a whole. Also address why the men are so easily manipulated.

**Example Revisions (Illustrative):**

*   **Original Conclusion:** "Although it superficially seems the women do not have power equal to that of the males, in reality, the issue is much more complicated. These women are not weak figures dominated by men; rather they wield much power in the lives of the men around them..."
*   **Revised Conclusion:** "While appearing subordinate to the patriarchal structure of Heorot, Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother wield a subtle yet undeniable influence, shaping events and challenging simplistic notions of female power in *Beowulf*. Though the narrator and characters focus on male heroism and actions, these two women, in their roles as queen and monster, are integral parts of Beowulf's story, demonstrating how strength can be found in traditionally feminine roles, and even in the heart of a monster's love. Perhaps the men's arrogance and traditional view of the women allow them to manipulate the men more easily."

**Overall, you've written a thoughtful and well-supported essay. By addressing the suggestions above, you can further enhance its clarity, depth, and impact.**
