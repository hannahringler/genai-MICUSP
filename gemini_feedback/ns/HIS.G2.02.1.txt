Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper based on its strengths and weaknesses, potential areas for improvement, and overall impression.

**Overall Impression:**

This paper presents a well-organized and thoughtful review of the literature on whiteness studies. It successfully identifies key themes, debates, and limitations within the field. The author demonstrates a strong grasp of the material, engaging with complex arguments and offering insightful critiques of the various scholars and their perspectives. However, at times, the argument can become a little bit too reliant on summaries of other scholars.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Structure:** The introduction clearly outlines the paper's purpose, scope, and argument. The division into sections (Race in Black and White, The Spectrum of Whiteness, Shifting the Frame: Beyond Race, Color and Class) provides a logical framework for the analysis.

*   **Comprehensive Literature Review:** The paper covers a wide range of important works in whiteness studies, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the field.

*   **Critical Engagement:** The author doesn't simply summarize the works but engages with them critically, identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. The author effectively contrasts different perspectives and points out inconsistencies in arguments.

*   **Insightful Analysis:** The paper offers insightful observations and connections between the different works. For example, the discussion of how Ignatiev and Jacobson fall short of escaping the black/white binary is well-argued.

*   **Strong Thesis and Argument:** The paper proposes a clear thesis, and the arguments presented throughout the paper consistently work towards the further development of the author's proposed thesis.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Over-Reliance on Summary:** At times, the paper relies too heavily on summarizing the arguments of other scholars, rather than developing its own original analysis and insights. Especially in the middle section on "The Spectrum of Whiteness," the paper spends a great deal of time describing the books examined without necessarily synthesizing all of them together or generating its own strong assertions from the reading.

*   **Authorial Voice:** While the paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the material, the author's own voice and perspective could be more prominent. Consider including more direct and personal statements about the significance of this research.

*   **Deepen the Critique of Gordon:** While the paper points out a weakness in Gordon's interpretation, this critique could be expanded. What are the implications of this weakness for her overall argument?

*   **Address Counterarguments:** While the paper critiques the limitations of whiteness studies, it could also address potential counterarguments or defenses of the field. What might proponents of whiteness studies say in response to these criticisms?

*   **Clarify the "So What?" Factor:** While the paper identifies promising directions for whiteness studies, it could more explicitly articulate the significance of this research. Why is it important to study whiteness? What are the broader implications of this field for understanding race, inequality, and social justice?

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **In the introduction:** Briefly explain the criteria used for selecting the seven books examined. Were these the most influential? The most representative? The most controversial?
*   **Throughout:** When summarizing an author's argument, try to integrate it more seamlessly with your own analysis. Rather than simply stating what the author argues, explain *why* it's relevant to your overall argument and *how* it connects to other works.
*   **In the section on "The Spectrum of Whiteness":** Consider a more in-depth analysis of the concept of a "spectrum" itself. Is this a useful metaphor for understanding whiteness? What are its limitations?
*   **In the conclusion:** Provide a more concrete vision for the future of whiteness studies. What specific research questions should scholars be addressing? What methodologies should they be using?
*   **Editing:** Proofread carefully for any grammatical errors or typos.

**Grading:**

Based on the strengths and weaknesses outlined above, I would estimate that this paper would receive a high grade, likely in the "A-" to "A" range. The paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the material and offers insightful analysis, but it could be further improved by increasing the author's original analysis and clearly articulating the significance of the research.
