Okay, I've reviewed the paper and can provide some feedback. Here's a breakdown of strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Focus and Thesis:** The paper clearly identifies its topic: the discourse of synchronized swimming, specifically focusing on the University of Michigan team. The thesis, examining different genres and the specific discourse community, is well-defined.
*   **Good Organization:** The paper is structured logically, moving from general background to specific examples of discourse genres (recruitment, FINA descriptions, land-drilling, coaching, cheering).
*   **Illustrative Examples:** The transcript excerpts from coaching sessions and pep talks are valuable and effectively illustrate the author's points about the discourse community's specific language and interaction styles.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** The analysis of each discourse genre is thoughtful and demonstrates understanding of discourse communities and their unique language. The observations about coaching style (land vs. water, club vs. varsity potential), shorthand communication, and the social dynamics of the team are well-supported.
*   **Originality:** The topic itself is fairly niche, offering a fresh perspective on discourse analysis applied to a specific sport and community.
*   **Conclusion with Recommendations:** The conclusion effectively summarizes the findings and offers concrete suggestions for how the team could adapt its discourse to potentially align with a more competitive (varsity) model.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Theoretical Framework:** While the paper identifies itself as a discourse analysis, it could benefit from a more explicit engagement with established discourse analysis theories and frameworks. For example, the paper could define more clearly what constitutes the definition of discourse analysis the author uses and the theory behind it. Even a brief mention of relevant scholars (e.g., Foucault, Gee, Swales) could strengthen the analysis.
*   **Connection between Genres:** The paper covers different genres of speech related to synchronized swimming. However, more discussion could be included about how they relate and impact each other.
*   **Clarity in Some Sections:** Some sections could benefit from improved clarity and flow. For example, some of the descriptions about FINA moves and land-drilling are a bit difficult to follow without prior knowledge of synchronized swimming.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Add a sentence or two outlining the structure of the paper.
    *   Consider adding a "hook" at the beginning. A more captivating opening sentence can draw the reader in.
*   **Literature Review/Theoretical Framework:**
    *   Dedicate a paragraph (or section) to explicitly outlining the theoretical framework being used for the discourse analysis.
    *   Briefly define key terms (e.g., "discourse community," "genre") from a theoretical perspective, citing relevant scholars.
*   **FINA Descriptions:**
    *   Provide more context or explanation for readers unfamiliar with FINA and the specific skills being described.
    *   Consider rephrasing some of the descriptions for clarity, or providing a visual aid beyond the included illustrations.
*   **Analysis of Transcriptions:**
    *   When analyzing the transcript excerpts, be more specific about linguistic features (e.g., use of slang, code-switching, hedges, politeness strategies) that contribute to the discourse community's identity.
    *   Explore the power dynamics at play in the coach-swimmer interactions. Is there evidence of negotiation, resistance, or deference?
    *   Relate this to more broader concepts around group dynamics, sport performance etc.
*   **Meet Announcements:**
    *   Provide a specific example of the meet announcement. Mentioning a specific technical term may be confusing to the reader.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Reiterate the main findings and their significance in a concise manner.
    *   Emphasize the implications of the team's current discourse practices and the potential benefits of adopting a different approach.

**Other Minor suggestions:**

*   **Proofread Carefully:** Do a final proofread to catch any minor grammatical errors or typos.
*   **Appendix:** It is recommended to include all appendices referenced in the paper.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that demonstrates a solid understanding of discourse analysis principles. By incorporating a more explicit theoretical framework and addressing the specific suggestions above, the author can further strengthen the analysis and create an even more compelling and persuasive argument. I hope this feedback is helpful!
