Okay, I can provide feedback on this philosophy paper. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses, along with suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

The paper demonstrates a good understanding of Mackie's error theory and engages critically with it, especially through the lens of Harrison's critique. The writing is generally clear and well-organized.  The argument is logical, and the author makes a reasonable case for a nuanced position regarding objective values. The essay shows independent thought and an ability to synthesize different philosophical positions.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis/Argument:** The paper has a central argument (that Mackie is too hasty in dismissing all objective values and that a hypothetical conception of objectivity is still viable) and maintains a consistent focus on it throughout.
*   **Good Understanding of the Material:** The author demonstrates a solid grasp of Mackie's error theory and Harrison's critique, as well as Warnock's position.
*   **Critical Engagement:** The paper doesn't simply summarize the views of others; it actively engages with them, pointing out weaknesses and proposing alternative interpretations.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure, moving from exposition to critique to a proposed alternative. The transitions are generally smooth.
*   **Clear Writing:** The prose is generally clear and easy to follow, although some sentences could be more concise.
*   **Use of Evidence:** The paper effectively uses quotes from Mackie and Harrison to support its claims.
*   **Nuance:** The paper avoids oversimplification and acknowledges the complexities of the issue. The author doesn't simply reject Mackie's view outright but attempts to refine it.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Some Repetitiveness:** At times, the paper reiterates the same points, especially regarding the distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives and the author's interpretation of Mackie.
*   **Potential for Deeper Engagement with Mackie's Motivations:** While the paper criticizes Mackie's conclusions, it could delve deeper into *why* Mackie was so keen to reject objective values. Exploring his underlying concerns (e.g., the problem of moral motivation, the perceived queerness of objective moral facts) could strengthen the critique.
*   **Limited Exploration of Alternative Metaethical Theories:** While the paper mentions non-cognitivism, it doesn't fully explore how these alternative metaethical theories might address the issues raised by Mackie. A brief discussion of expressivism or constructivism could add depth.
*   **Reliance on a Single Interpretation of "Amelioration of the Human Condition":** The paper relies heavily on the concept of "amelioration of the human condition" as a grounding for objective values. It could acknowledge potential objections to this view (e.g., whose condition counts, how to measure amelioration, potential conflicts between different conceptions of amelioration).
*   **The "Chess Analogy" could be developed more** The chessboard analogy is a good one but there could be some deeper thinking about what this comparison means for objectivism.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Tighten Up the Prose:**
    *   Look for opportunities to condense sentences and eliminate unnecessary words.
    *   Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony.

2.  **Reduce Repetition:**
    *   Review the paper carefully and identify instances where the same points are made repeatedly.
    *   Consolidate these points and rephrase them in a more concise way.

3.  **Delve Deeper into Mackie's Motivations:**
    *   Discuss Mackie's concerns about moral motivation and the "queerness" of objective moral facts.
    *   Explain how these concerns led him to adopt his error theory.

4.  **Consider Alternative Metaethical Theories:**
    *   Briefly discuss how expressivism or constructivism might address the issues raised by Mackie.
    *   Explain how these theories differ from Mackie's error theory and the author's proposed alternative.

5.  **Acknowledge Potential Objections to "Amelioration of the Human Condition":**
    *   Discuss potential problems with using "amelioration of the human condition" as a grounding for objective values.
    *   Consider whose condition counts, how to measure amelioration, and potential conflicts between different conceptions of amelioration.
    *   Is this metric itself, subject to ethical problems?

6.  **Strengthen the Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the main points of the paper in a clear and concise way.
    *   Reiterate the author's thesis and explain its significance.
    *   Consider suggesting avenues for further research or reflection on the topic.
    *   Think about how this conclusion relates to contemporary ethical problems.

7. **Expand the chess analogy:**
    * Compare how chess pieces, like human actions, can have rightness or wrongness attributed to them.

**Specific Examples**

*   **Page 1, Paragraph 3:** "And I will tentatively accept for the sake of argument Mackie's assumption that it is actually meaningful to say that such qualities adhere in actions in the world." This sentence is a bit clunky and could be rephrased for clarity.  Perhaps: "For the sake of argument, I will grant Mackie's assumption that it is meaningful to say that such qualities can adhere in actions."
*   **Throughout:** Be mindful of overusing phrases like "I think" or "in my opinion." While it's important to express your own perspective, avoid phrasing that weakens your arguments. Instead of "I think Mackie is wrong," try "Mackie's argument is unconvincing because..."

**Overall Grade (Estimate)**

Based on the strengths and weaknesses, I would estimate this paper to be in the B+ to A- range. With the suggested improvements, it could definitely be elevated to a solid A.
Good luck! Let me know if you have any other questions.
