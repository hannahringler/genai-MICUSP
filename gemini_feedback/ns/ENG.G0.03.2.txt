Okay, I've reviewed the essay "Who Is God?" and here's some feedback, broken down into categories:

**Overall Impression**

This is a strong, insightful analysis of Anse Bundren's character in *As I Lay Dying*. You've identified a key aspect of the novel – the problematic nature of faith in the face of suffering – and explored it through a focused analysis of Anse's words and actions. The argument is clearly presented and well-supported by textual evidence. The essay displays a good understanding of both the novel and theological concepts.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The central argument – that Faulkner uses Anse's character to paint a picture of an unjust and unfaithful God – is clear from the start.

*   **Focused Analysis:**  You concentrate on Anse's monologues and specific passages to demonstrate his contradictory and often self-serving understanding of God. This focus keeps the essay grounded in the text.

*   **Strong Textual Support:** You consistently use direct quotes from the novel to back up your claims. The quotations are well-integrated into your analysis.

*   **Insightful Interpretation:** You go beyond a surface-level reading of Anse's words to reveal the underlying implications about his relationship with God and the world. The connection between the road, Addie's death, and Anse's theology is particularly well-developed.

*   **Theological Understanding:**  You demonstrate a solid grasp of the Christian concepts of original sin, the sin-curse, and the relationship between suffering and faith. This allows you to analyze Anse's beliefs with greater depth.

*   **Well-Organized:** The essay progresses logically, building its argument step-by-step. Each paragraph focuses on a specific aspect of Anse's character or a particular passage from the novel.

*   **Good Use of Paradox:** You effectively highlight the paradoxes within Anse's beliefs and how they reflect a distorted view of God.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While the argument is strong, there's a slight tendency to present Anse as purely negative. Consider adding a bit more nuance. Does Anse *genuinely* believe some of what he says? Are there moments where his faith might be seen as a coping mechanism, even if misguided? Exploring these complexities could strengthen your analysis.

*   **Consider Other Interpretations:** While your interpretation is well-supported, acknowledging alternative readings could add depth. For example, is there any merit to the idea that Anse is simply a product of his environment, and his beliefs are a reflection of the harsh realities of his life?
    *   Do other characters' views on religion in the novel affect how readers view Anse's views on God?

*   **Strengthen the Conclusion:** The conclusion is good, but it could be even more impactful. Instead of simply restating the thesis, consider offering a final thought about the broader implications of Faulkner's portrayal of faith in the novel. Does it serve as a critique of religious dogma, a reflection of the human struggle with suffering, or something else entirely?

*   **Formatting of Bible Passage:** Consider which formating style you are using and ensure it is applied to the bible passage as well.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Page 2 "God put roads for travelling"**: Ensure that the in-text citation is accurate.

*   **Page 3 “Cash,” – precisely that which he means to Anse.**: While the statement makes sense when read within the paragraph, adding more details to it would make the statement more clear when it is initially read.

*   **Page 5 "Every man will be equal there and it will be taken from them that have and given to them that have not by the Lord," (110).**: The argument and reference is well executed.

**Revised Thesis (Example)**

Here's an example of a slightly revised thesis that incorporates a bit more nuance:

"While Anse Bundren outwardly clings to a belief in God, Faulkner uses his character's self-serving interpretations of scripture and his tendency to blame divine forces for his misfortunes to construct a portrait of an unjust and ultimately unfaithful God, revealing the complexities and contradictions inherent in faith when confronted with the harsh realities of life."

**In Summary**

This is a well-written and insightful essay that demonstrates a strong understanding of *As I Lay Dying* and its complex themes. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can further refine your argument and create an even more compelling analysis. Good work!
