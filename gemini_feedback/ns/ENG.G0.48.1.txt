Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and overall impressions:

**Overall Impression**

This is a very insightful and well-written essay. The core idea—rewriting excerpts from two novels in the style of the other—is a brilliant way to explore the relationship between form and content. The analysis is thoughtful, nuanced, and demonstrates a strong grasp of the authors and their works. The paper is engaging and original.

**Strengths**

*   **Originality and Insight:** The central concept of rewriting passages is innovative and provides a unique lens through which to compare and contrast the two authors. Your insights into how each author's style shapes the content of their narratives are compelling.
*   **Clear Thesis and Focused Argument:** You clearly state your goal and then skillfully use your rewritten passages as evidence to support your claims.
*   **Strong Analytical Skills:** You demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of both authors' styles and themes. You go beyond surface-level comparisons and delve into the underlying reasons for their stylistic choices.
*   **Effective Use of Evidence:** You provide specific examples from both novels (and your rewrites) to support your analysis.
*   **Engaging Writing Style:** The essay is well-written, articulate, and maintains the reader's interest throughout.
*   **Awareness of Limitations:** You acknowledge the constraints of the paper and potential avenues for further exploration, which demonstrates intellectual maturity.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Specificity in Analysis of Rewrites:** While the general effects of the rewrites are discussed, providing more specific examples from the rewrites themselves could further strengthen the analysis. For instance, highlighting a particular phrase or sentence that changed dramatically and explaining *why* it was changed in a certain way would be beneficial.
*   **Nuance in Characterizing Dos Passos:** While you effectively contrast Yezierska's internal narration with Dos Passos's external narration, there's a risk of portraying Dos Passos as simply "lacking" emotion. Consider acknowledging that Dos Passos's style, though detached, serves a specific purpose – perhaps to convey a sense of alienation, objectivity, or the overwhelming forces of modernity.
*   **Consider a Deeper Dive into "Modernism"**: You mentioned that the texts still share themes that are common to modernism. It would be beneficial to provide more detail on this. What specific themes in modernism do the texts share?

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Rewrite Analysis - Daughter:** Go further into which specific lines from the original passage had to be altered in the rewrite. Why did you choose these lines in particular, and how do those lines contribute to the overall contrast in form and content?
*   **Dos Pasos' Detachment:** Rather than simply labeling Dos Pasos as "unsentimental," explore *why* he might have chosen that style. Was it a reflection of the historical period? A way to critique society? A stylistic experiment?
*   **"Modernism" Deep Dive**: Mentioning this in the conclusion is great, but it is a loose thread. What specific aspects of modernism are present in both texts despite stylistic differences? (e.g., alienation, fragmentation, loss of faith, the impact of industrialization, etc.). Connecting them would strengthen the conclusion.

**In summary**

This is a strong paper demonstrating a very sophisticated and original approach to literary analysis. By addressing the suggestions, you can elevate it to an even higher level.
