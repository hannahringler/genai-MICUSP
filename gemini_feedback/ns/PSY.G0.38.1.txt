Here's some feedback on the paper you submitted, considering it as a literature review on adolescent sexual education:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The paper has a clear thesis statement that outlines the scope of the review (family conversation, school/community programs, comprehensive sexual education).
*   **Organization:**  The paper is generally well-organized, with distinct sections for family-based education, school/community-based education, and comprehensive sexual education. This makes it easy to follow the argument.
*   **Summary of Research:** You effectively summarize the key findings of the studies you reviewed.
*   **Critical Evaluation:**  You provide a critical evaluation of the studies, pointing out both strengths (longitudinal design, diverse samples) and weaknesses (self-report bias, limited generalizability).
*   **Focus on Implications:** You consistently point out the implications of the research for policy and practice.
*   **Inclusion of Contrasting Perspectives:** The paper considers both the potential effectiveness of different approaches to sexual education.
*   **Identified Future Directions:** The concluding section effectively highlights limitations and proposes future research directions.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While you summarize studies effectively, there could be more in-depth analysis of how the studies relate to each other. Are there conflicting findings? What patterns emerge across studies? You could also synthesize the research more by drawing more connections between the different types of education that were studied.
*   **Strengthen the Introduction and Conclusion:** The introduction could be more engaging and provide a stronger sense of the argument to come. The conclusion could do more than summarize; it could offer a more forward-looking synthesis of the literature and a more compelling call to action.
*   **Specificity of Recommendations:** The recommendations regarding policy changes could be more specific. Which laws should be changed? What are some examples of "effective programs" that should be implemented? Providing concrete examples would strengthen the argument.

**Specific suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Consider starting with a more compelling statistic or anecdote to highlight the importance of the topic.
    *   Expand slightly on the definition of "comprehensive sexual education" early on.
*   **Body:**
    *   When discussing limitations, consider suggesting ways those limitations could be addressed in future research.
    *   In the "School and Community Based Education" section, spend slightly more time discussing the specific components of successful programs (e.g., the computer-based intervention in Roberto et al.). What made them effective?
    *   As you mention the need for more research on minority groups, think about why these groups are often not represented.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Reiterate your main argument in a more concise and powerful way.
    *   Offer a stronger, more actionable set of recommendations for policy and practice.
*   **Style:**
    *   Be mindful of language. The phrase "abstinence-only programs had no impacts" could be rephrased for greater impact and clarity.

Overall, this is a well-organized and informative literature review. By addressing the suggestions above, you can elevate the analysis and make it even more persuasive.
