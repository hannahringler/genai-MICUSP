Okay, I've reviewed your paper and have some feedback for you, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions.

**Overall Impression**

Your paper presents a good overview of the debates surrounding human rights and the effectiveness of international law. You successfully summarize the arguments of Slomanson, Donnelly, and Hathaway, and you offer your own perspective, engaging critically with their ideas.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper is well-organized with a clear introduction, body paragraphs summarizing the authors' views, a comparative section, and your own analysis. This makes it easy to follow your line of reasoning.
*   **Solid Summaries:** You accurately capture the main points of each author's arguments. You are able to distill complex ideas into concise summaries.
*   **Engaging with the Material:** You go beyond simply summarizing; you compare and contrast the authors' perspectives and offer your own informed opinion.
*   **Good Use of Citations:** You properly cite your sources, which strengthens the credibility of your arguments.
*   **Thesis Clarity:** Your implied thesis, that Hathaway's approach is most compelling because of her data driven argument, is a well argued stance.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Deeper Analysis:** While you present the authors' arguments well, the comparative and analytical sections could benefit from more in-depth analysis.
*   **Elaboration of Your Own Perspective:** You state your preference for Hathaway's approach, but you could strengthen this by more explicitly explaining *why* you find it more compelling and how it addresses the shortcomings of the other perspectives.
*   **Specificity:** Some sections contain general statements that could be made more persuasive with specific examples or supporting evidence.
*   **Nuance and Counterarguments:** Consider acknowledging potential limitations or counterarguments to your chosen perspective. This shows critical thinking and strengthens your analysis.
*   **Transitions:** Some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to improve the overall flow of the paper.
*   **Proofreading:** There are a few minor grammatical errors and stylistic issues that could be corrected with careful proofreading.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **In the Introduction:**
    *   Consider adding a sentence or two that explicitly states the *problem* or debate that these authors are addressing. What is at stake in these discussions about human rights? This will provide context and make your introduction more engaging.
*   **Slomanson-The “Western” Derivation of Universal Human Rights:**
    *   Expand on the specific examples of "Western" cultural and religious influences that non-Western states object to.
    *   Elaborate on the differences in how Africa perceives human rights. What does it mean to have a "broader basis than just the individual?"
    *   Clarify the connection between China's view of sovereignty and its resistance to international human rights law.
*   **Donnelly-Human Rights, a Key Piece in the Development of a New Standard of Civilization:**
    *   Provide a more concrete explanation of what Donnelly means by "legitimizing norm." How does this norm manifest itself in international relations?
    *   Instead of just stating the Genocide and Rwanda examples, mention how those examples led to international response.
*   **Hathaway-The Realities of the International Law of Torture:**
    *   Expand on the key difference between instrumentalist and normativist approaches.
    *   Instead of only listing the 5 points that Hathaway makes, explain how those points influence your point of view that Hathaway's perspective is compelling.
*   **Comparing Slomanson, Donnelly and Hathaway:**
    *   Connect the Instrumental view that Hathaway has more directly to parts of Slomanson and Donnelly's point of view.
*   **How I See It:**
    *   Explain in more detail *why* Hathaway's data-driven approach is more convincing than the other perspectives.
    *   Discuss potential limitations of Hathaway's approach. Are there factors that her analysis doesn't adequately address?

**Revised Examples**

*   **Original:** "I'm sure that if you asked any of these authors, they would not find international human rights law following any strict instrumental or normative ideology."
*   **Revised:** "While each author may lean toward one side of the debate, it's likely that they would acknowledge that international human rights law exists on a spectrum of instrumental and normative views."

**Remember to Proofread Carefully:**

*   Check for typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies in style.
*   Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, pronoun usage, and punctuation.

**In Summary**

You have a good foundation for a strong paper. By adding more analysis, elaborating on your own perspective, and providing specific examples, you can take your work to the next level. Good luck!
