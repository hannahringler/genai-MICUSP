Okay, I can help you with that. I will provide feedback on this paper, focusing on areas like clarity, organization, argument strength, and adherence to academic conventions.

**Overall Impression**

The paper presents a relevant and important topic: the prevention of eating disorders in young girls. The author identifies a gap in current prevention methods and proposes a project to address it. The use of survey data from smartgirl.org is a good way to ground the proposal in real-world concerns. However, there's room for improvement in the clarity of the argument, the detail of the proposed project, and the integration of the literature.

**Specific Feedback**

**1. Introduction:**

*   **Strengths:** The introduction effectively establishes the prevalence of eating disorders and sub-clinical eating disorder symptoms. It also highlights the shortcomings of current prevention methods.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Thesis Statement:** The thesis statement could be more explicit and focused. Currently, it's more of a statement of intent ("My proposal is..."). A stronger thesis would clearly state the proposed solution and its potential impact. For example: "This proposal argues that providing pre-adolescent girls with comprehensive nutrition education and resources for addressing anxieties around food can serve as a preventative measure against the development of clinical and sub-clinical eating disorders."
    *   **Clarity:** Be more specific about what constitutes “prevention mechanisms”.
*   **Flow:** The jump from identifying the problem to the proposed solution is a bit abrupt. Briefly explain the rationale behind focusing on nutrition education. Why do you believe this approach will be effective?

**2. Methods:**

*   **Strengths:** The paper clearly outlines the rationale for analyzing survey data from SmartGirl.org.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Survey Details:** Provide more details about the survey methodology. What was the sample size? How was the survey administered? When was the survey conducted?
    *   **Data Analysis:** The correlational analysis is mentioned, but the specific statistical methods used could be clarified.
    *   **Limitations:** The limitations of the survey (acknowledged later in the paper) should be briefly mentioned in this section as well.
    *   **The graph of the correlation is missing from the document**

**3. Results:**

*   **Strengths:** The results section clearly presents the key findings from the survey data, highlighting the interest in nutrition and concerns about body image among Smart Girl members.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Specificity:** Be more precise when reporting the survey results. For example, instead of "118 girls answered 'agree' to varied extents," provide the specific breakdown of responses (e.g., "35% strongly agreed, 25% agreed").
    *   **Table 2 Improvements:** The table is missing some data.

**4. Discussion:**

*   **Strengths:** The discussion effectively connects the survey findings to the broader issue of eating disorder prevention. It also acknowledges the limitations of the survey.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Project Details:** This section should elaborate on the proposed project. What specific resources will be created? How will the question-and-answer format work? How will the science of nutrition be addressed alongside anxieties about food?
    *   **Theoretical Framework:** Briefly discuss the theoretical basis for the proposed intervention. What psychological theories support the idea that nutrition education and addressing anxieties can prevent eating disorders?
    *   **Impact:** Discuss potential outcomes of the project. How will the effectiveness of the intervention be evaluated?

**5. Literature Review and Referencing:**

*   **Strengths:** The paper includes relevant references.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Integration:** Integrate the existing literature more thoroughly into the argument. Use the references to support your claims, explain the rationale for your approach, and demonstrate your understanding of the field.
    *   **Missing citations:** There are a few instances where information that would benefit from a citation is not cited.
    *   **Formatting:** Check and ensure all references are consistently formatted according to a specific citation style (APA, MLA, etc.).

**6. Clarity and Style:**

*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Word Choice:** Watch out for vague or imprecise language. For example, phrases like "a host of anxieties" could be made more specific.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Vary your sentence structure to improve readability.
    *   **Proofreading:** Carefully proofread the paper for grammar and spelling errors.

**Overall Recommendations**

1.  **Strengthen the Thesis:** Create a clear, concise thesis statement that directly answers the question of how you plan to prevent eating disorders.
2.  **Elaborate on the Project:** Provide more details about the proposed project. This will make the proposal more concrete and persuasive.
3.  **Integrate the Literature:** Use the existing research to support your claims and demonstrate your understanding of the field.
4.  **Refine the Survey Details:** Add more details about the data gathered and the analysis methodology.
5.  **Enhance Clarity and Style:** Use precise language, vary your sentence structure, and carefully proofread the paper.

By addressing these areas, you can strengthen the argument, enhance the clarity, and improve the overall quality of your paper. I hope this feedback is helpful.
