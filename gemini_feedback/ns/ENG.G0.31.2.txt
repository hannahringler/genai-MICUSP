Okay, here's some feedback on the paper. This focuses on the content, clarity, argumentation, and areas for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper provides a good summary and initial analysis of Jack Zipes' perspective on Disney's interpretations of fairy tales. It clearly identifies Zipes' main arguments and provides some supporting evidence from his work. The structure is logical, and the writing is generally clear. However, the paper could be strengthened by delving deeper into Zipes' critiques, providing more specific examples, and developing a more original argument in response to Zipes.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Summary of Zipes' Argument:** The paper accurately summarizes Zipes' main points about the evolution of fairy tales, the role of the printing press, Disney's revolutionary yet problematic approach, and the social implications of these transformations.
*   **Focus on Context:** The paper effectively highlights Zipes' emphasis on the social and historical context of fairy tales, both in their traditional form and in Disney's adaptations.
*   **Well-Organized:** The paper follows a logical structure, moving from a general overview of Zipes' argument to more specific points about Disney's work and its impact.
*   **Clear Writing:** The prose is generally clear and easy to understand.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Analysis and Elaboration:**
    *   The paper primarily summarizes Zipes' arguments. It needs more in-depth analysis of those arguments. For example:
        *   When you mention Zipes' Marxist critique, explain *how* fairy tales separated people by wealth and education. What specific elements of the tales contributed to this separation?
        *   Elaborate on the specific ways Disney's films reinforce patriarchal ideas, social status, and gender roles. Provide specific examples from Disney films to illustrate these points.
    *   Consider adding counterarguments to Zipes' claims. Are there other perspectives on Disney's adaptations that might challenge his views?
*   **More Specific Examples:**
    *   While you mention "Snow White," providing more concrete examples from other Disney films (e.g., Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid) would strengthen your analysis and make your arguments more convincing.
    *   Refer to other specific arguments from the book.
*   **Develop a Stronger Thesis/Argument:**
    *   The paper lacks a clear, overarching thesis statement that goes beyond simply summarizing Zipes' argument. What is *your* argument about Zipes' view of Disney? Do you agree with him? Disagree? Do you find his analysis insightful but incomplete?
    *   Consider framing your essay around a specific question or debate related to Zipes' ideas.
*   **Consideration of other scholarly sources**: While focusing on Zipes is a solid starting point, engaging with other scholarship on Disney, fairy tales, and cultural studies would greatly enrich your analysis. These additional sources could provide alternative perspectives, offer supporting evidence for your claims, and demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
*   **Nuance and Complexity:** Avoid overly simplistic statements. For example, the statement that Disney's interpretations "reinforce ideas of patriarchy, social status, and gender roles that have little place in our modern world" is a bit broad. Acknowledge the complexities of these issues and avoid making generalizations.
*   **Formatting/Citation:** It looks like it's from a MICUSP paper, so it would be good to keep the citation style from that.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **In the introduction:** Add a sentence or two outlining your own perspective on Zipes' argument. This will serve as your thesis statement. For example: "While Zipes' critique of Disney's commercialization and ideological implications of fairy tales is insightful, his analysis overlooks the ways in which Disney also democratized these stories and introduced new themes relevant to contemporary audiences."
*   **When discussing "Snow White":** Instead of just stating that Snow White is "heavily domesticated," explain *how* this is portrayed in the film. What specific actions or characteristics demonstrate her domesticity? How does this reinforce traditional gender roles?
*   **Explore the "infantile quest" further:** Elaborate on what Zipes means by this term and how it connects to American mythology.
*   **Address potential counterarguments:** Acknowledge that some people might view Disney's adaptations as positive contributions to children's entertainment. Address these alternative perspectives and explain why you still find Zipes' critique to be valid (or partially valid).

**Revised Structure (Example):**

1.  **Introduction:** Introduce the topic, briefly summarize Zipes' argument, and state your thesis (your own argument about Zipes' view of Disney).
2.  **Summary of Zipes' Main Points:** Provide a more detailed summary of Zipes' key arguments about the evolution of fairy tales, the role of the printing press, and Disney's adaptations.
3.  **Analysis of Disney's Adaptations:** Focus on specific Disney films and analyze how they reflect or diverge from Zipes' claims. Provide specific examples to support your analysis.
4.  **Critique of Zipes' Argument:** Offer your own evaluation of Zipes' argument. Do you agree with him? Disagree? Do you find his analysis insightful but incomplete?
5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize your main points and restate your thesis in a more nuanced way.

By addressing these areas for improvement, you can elevate your paper from a summary of Zipes' ideas to a more insightful and original analysis of Disney's fairy tales. Good luck!
