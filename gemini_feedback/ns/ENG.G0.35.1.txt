Okay, I've reviewed your essay on courtship in *Twelfth Night*. Here's some feedback, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions.

**Overall Impression**

This is a well-written and thoughtful essay. You have a clear thesis, you support it with textual evidence, and you offer insightful interpretations. The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the play and its themes. Your writing style is generally strong and academic.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** Your thesis statement (that Shakespeare takes a skeptical stance on courtship, demonstrating it can be a superficial expression of love) is clear, focused, and arguable.
*   **Strong Textual Support:** You consistently use quotes from the play to support your claims, which strengthens your analysis.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** You go beyond simply summarizing the plot and offer insightful interpretations of the characters' motivations and actions. Your analysis of Orsino, Olivia, and Viola is particularly well done.
*   **Well-Organized:** The essay is logically organized, with each paragraph focusing on a specific aspect of your argument. The transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth.
*   **Good Use of Language:** Your writing is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. Your vocabulary is appropriate for an academic essay.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Depth of Analysis (in places):** While your analysis is generally strong, there are a few places where you could dig a little deeper. For example, when discussing Malvolio and Sir Andrew, you mention they "both genuinely believe they have a legitimate chance of marrying Olivia." Expand on *why* they believe this, even though it's delusional. What societal factors or personal flaws contribute to their delusion?
*   **Counterarguments/Nuance:** While you present a compelling argument, consider addressing potential counterarguments or adding some nuance. For example, could it be argued that even though the courtships of Orsino and Olivia are ultimately "unsuccessful," they still reveal something important about the nature of love or desire?
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion could be stronger. While it summarizes your main points, it feels a little repetitive. Try to end with a more insightful or thought-provoking statement about the broader implications of Shakespeare's portrayal of courtship.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Introduction:** Consider adding a slightly more specific hook to grab the reader's attention right away. Instead of a general statement about love in plays, perhaps start with a brief, intriguing observation about the *specific* challenges of courtship in *Twelfth Night*.
*   **Paragraph 2 (Orsino):** You write, "Indeed, in his courtship with Olivia, he never actually does any of the courting himself, but sends out Valentine and Cesario..." This is a key point. Expand on *why* this is significant. What does it reveal about his self-absorption or his understanding of love?
*   **Paragraph 3 (Olivia):** When you say, "Cesario does not actually exist in reality; he is a character," this is a bit confusing. Clarify that you mean Cesario is a *disguise*. This will make your point about Olivia's infatuation with an illusion even stronger.
*   **Paragraph 4 (Orsino's Delusions):** Your analysis of Orsino's speech about men's and women's love is excellent. Consider briefly connecting this to the theme of gender roles in the play, further enriching your interpretation.
*   **Paragraph 5 (Viola):** Expand on the idea that Viola's love is genuine *because* it is not expressed through courtship. What is it about the *lack* of outward performance that makes her love more authentic?
*   **Conclusion:** Instead of simply restating your thesis, try to offer a final reflection on the significance of Shakespeare's portrayal of courtship. Does it suggest that genuine love is always spontaneous and unforced? Does it offer a critique of societal expectations around romance? What is the lasting message of the play regarding love and courtship?

**Revised/Added Content Examples (Illustrative)**

*   **Introduction (Revised Hook):**  "In *Twelfth Night*, declarations of love are often grandiose, self-serving, and ultimately misleading.  Shakespeare's comedy, however, suggests that true affection may reside not in passionate pronouncements, but in the quiet depths of unrequited longing."
*   **Paragraph 2 (Added Depth):** "Indeed, in his courtship with Olivia, he never actually does any of the courting himself, but sends out Valentine and Cesario... This reliance on intermediaries reveals Orsino's performative understanding of love. He is more enamored with the *idea* of being in love than with the actual work of building a connection with another person.  His pursuit of Olivia becomes a theatrical production, with himself as the star, rather than a genuine attempt at intimacy."
*   **Paragraph 5 (Viola Expansion):** "The private nature of Viola's love is a notable difference.  Viola's love exists whether or not it is explicitly expressed through courtship. Its very *inability* to be expressed outwardly becomes a testament to its depth and authenticity. Unlike Orsino and Olivia, Viola doesn't need to *perform* her love to validate it; it exists as a profound internal experience."

**Grading Considerations (Hypothetical)**

Based on the information you have provided, this essay would likely receive a grade in the A- to A range. The clarity of your thesis, the strong textual support, and the insightful analysis are all hallmarks of excellent work. Addressing the areas for improvement noted above would elevate the essay to the highest possible level.

By implementing these suggestions, you can refine your essay and make it even more compelling. Good luck!
