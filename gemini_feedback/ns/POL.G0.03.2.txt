Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, including strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression**

This is a well-structured and thoughtful essay that tackles a complex topic. You demonstrate a good understanding of the EU's institutional structure and policy areas, and you present a clear argument. The writing is generally clear and articulate. However, there are areas where the analysis could be deepened, and the argumentation could be strengthened.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The thesis is presented clearly in the introduction, stating that the EU is primarily intergovernmental but could benefit from a supranational structure.
*   **Good Structure:** The essay follows a logical structure, dividing the analysis into empirical analysis (institutions, policy areas) and normative analysis (arguments for each side).
*   **Solid Knowledge:** You demonstrate a strong understanding of the EU's complex structure and key policy areas.
*   **Balanced Approach:** You attempt to present both sides of the argument fairly, which is important for an argumentative essay.
*   **Clear Writing:** The writing is generally clear, concise, and academic in tone. You use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
*   **Cited Sources:** There is a works cited at the end of the paper.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While the essay covers a lot of ground, some sections lack depth. You describe institutions and policies, but you could analyze *why* certain dynamics (e.g., intergovernmental bargaining) are prevalent and what their concrete consequences are. For example, you mention that agriculture has strong ties to intergovernmental bargaining. It would be helpful if you gave an example.
*   **Evidence and Examples:** While you mention specific policies (e.g., the Single European Act, the Euro), you could use more specific examples to support your claims. Concrete examples make the argument more convincing.
*   **Normative Arguments:** The "Arguments for Intergovernmentalism" and "Arguments for Supranationalism" sections could be strengthened by providing more compelling and original reasons.
*   **Counterarguments:** While you mention some drawbacks of supranationalism, the essay could benefit from more explicit engagement with potential counterarguments to your preferred position. For example, could a strong supranational EU threaten national identities or democratic accountability?
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion could be more forceful. It summarizes the arguments but doesn't offer a really strong final statement or a call to action.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Expand on Institutional Analysis:** When discussing institutions like the Council of Ministers, explain *how* national interests influence decision-making. Provide specific examples of countries blocking or shaping legislation to benefit themselves.
*   **Strengthen Policy Area Analysis:**
    *   **Economic Policy:** Go beyond describing the Single Market and Euro. Discuss their successes and failures in more detail.
    *   **Foreign Policy:** Expand on the Iraq War example. Explain how intergovernmental divisions hampered the EU's ability to act.
    *   **Other Policies:** In areas like environmental policy, give specific examples of how intergovernmental dynamics hinder progress.
*   **Develop Normative Arguments:**
    *   **Intergovernmentalism:** Explore deeper reasons *why* national sovereignty is important to some EU members.
    *   **Supranationalism:** Go beyond just efficiency. Explain how supranational cooperation can address shared challenges more effectively.
*   **Address Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and respond to potential criticisms of supranationalism. This will make your argument more nuanced and convincing.

**Grammar and Style**
* I noticed one minor grammatical issue:  "Neither his spoke his language." I suggest that you change it to "who neither spoke his language."

**Revised Thesis (Optional)**

Consider revising your thesis to be more specific and argumentative. For example:

*"While the European Union's institutional structure and key policy areas are presently dominated by intergovernmental dynamics, a shift towards a more robust supranational framework is essential to enhance the EU's global influence, address shared challenges like climate change, and ensure long-term economic stability, though safeguards are needed to protect national identities and democratic accountability."*

**In Summary**

This is a solid essay with a clear understanding of the topic. By deepening the analysis, providing more specific evidence, strengthening the normative arguments, and addressing counterarguments, you can elevate it to an even higher level.
