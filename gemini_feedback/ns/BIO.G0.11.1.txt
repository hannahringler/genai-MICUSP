Okay, here's some feedback on the paper proposal, focusing on clarity, scientific rigor, and overall presentation.

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-structured and ambitious proposal. The student clearly understands the research area and has a good grasp of the relevant literature. The proposal is generally well-written and organized. However, some areas could be improved for clarity, and some details should be more rigorously addressed.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Introduction and Background:** The introduction effectively sets the stage by explaining the context of growing plants in hypobaric environments, especially for space exploration. The rationale for the research is well-established.
*   **Literature Review:** The references provided indicate a solid understanding of existing research in plant stress responses and hypobaric biology.
*   **Well-Defined Research Questions:** The proposal identifies two main goals: 1) identify pathways involved in a plant experiencing hypobaria and 2) identify what stress responses to knockout or knockdown.
*   **Logical Experimental Design:** The experimental approaches using microarrays, RT-PCR, and mutant plant generation are appropriate and align with the research questions.
*   **Justification for Model Organism:** The choice of Arabidopsis is well-justified based on its well-characterized genome.
*   **Understanding of Stress Responses:** The proposal demonstrates a good understanding of various plant stress responses (hypoxia, drought, cold, heat).

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Specificity and Justification of Experimental Parameters:**

    *   **Pressure Level:** While the 2 kPa pressure is mentioned, more justification should be given for this particular level. Why is it considered relevant to Martian conditions? Why not other levels?
    *   **Oxygen Concentration:** The 9 mmol/L oxygen concentration is stated, but the rationale behind it needs to be explained.  Is this based on previous studies?
    *   **Time Points:** The time points for the microarray experiment (30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) seem comprehensive, but a brief justification for this particular range is needed.
    *   **Statistical Considerations:**  The proposal should briefly address how the data from microarrays and RT-PCR will be statistically analyzed.  What statistical tests will be used to determine significant differences in gene expression?  What will be the sample sizes (number of biological replicates)?

2.  **Experiment 2 - Mutant Creation:**

    *   **Specific Mutants:** The proposal mentions creating or purchasing mutant Arabidopsis plants with dysfunctional CBFs/DREBPs, ABI1, and ABI3.  It needs to specify which specific CBF/DREBPs, ABI1, and ABI3 genes will be targeted (there are multiple isoforms).
    *   **Methods for Creating Mutants:**  Provide more detail on how the mutants will be created.  Will CRISPR-Cas9 be used?  T-DNA insertion lines?  The feasibility of creating knockout mutants for multiple genes should be discussed.  Double and triple mutants can sometimes be difficult to create and maintain.
    *   **Assessing Mutant Phenotypes:** How will the success of the mutation be confirmed?  (e.g., by sequencing, RT-PCR to show reduced transcript levels, Western blot to show reduced protein levels).
    *   **Control Plants:**  What will the control plants be for Experiment 2?  Will wild-type Arabidopsis be grown alongside the mutants?  Will complemented lines be used (where the mutated gene is reintroduced)?

3.  **Clarity and Precision:**

    *   **Confusing Phrases:** Replace "genes are inferably repressed in hypobaric plants" with clearer language like "genes are less expressed in hypobaric plants."
    *    **Define acronyms**: Before using "CBF", "LEA", "COR", etc. state the full term.

4.  **Broader Implications:**

    *   While the proposal mentions the potential for genetic engineering for space missions, it could benefit from a brief discussion of the broader implications of this research for terrestrial agriculture. Could understanding stress responses in hypobaric conditions also inform strategies for improving drought or cold tolerance in crops?

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Abstract:** Excellent summary of the research plan.
*   **Introduction:** Very good. The connection to space missions is compelling.
*   **Experiment 1:**
    *   "The plant of choice for my experiments will involve *Arabidopsis thaliana*, since the most is known about its genome..." - Consider replacing "the most" with "the most information" for improved readability.
    *   "I will utilize the same GeneChip for the Arabidopsis genome as used by Paul et al. in their experiment (4)."  Mention the specific GeneChip model number (e.g., Affymetrix ATH1).
    *   Clarify the rationale for choosing different tissues (shoots, leaves, roots).
    *   "Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is an enzyme that is essential for glycolysis to proceed..." While ADH is involved in alcohol fermentation, it also has a role in glycolysis. This could be clarified.
    *   "At the 24-hour time period and week time periods, I will use RT-PCR..." State the purpose of RT-PCR more clearly (to validate microarray results).
*   **Experiment 2:**
    *   "The preferred method of mutation would be gene knockouts..." - Acknowledge potential challenges or limitations of creating and maintaining knockout mutants for multiple genes.
    *   "Silencer RNA would be a second option..." - Discuss the potential limitations of using siRNA (transient effects, incomplete knockdown).
*   **References:** The references are well-formatted.

**Revised Sentence Examples:**

*   **Original:** "Identifying genes that are repressed is equally important, because certain genes can be harmful to the plant during a time of stress."
*   **Revised:** "Identifying genes that are repressed in hypobaric conditions is also important, as some of these genes may encode proteins that are detrimental to plant survival under stress."
*   **Original:** "I will fix the air flowing through the LPGC to have an oxygen concentration of 9 mmol/L."
*   **Revised:** "The air flowing through the LPGC will be maintained at an oxygen concentration of 9 mmol/L, a level previously shown to support normal growth and respiration in Arabidopsis under similar conditions (cite reference if applicable)."

**In summary:** This is a solid proposal. By addressing the points above, the student can strengthen the proposal, making it more convincing and demonstrating a deeper level of scientific understanding. Good luck!
