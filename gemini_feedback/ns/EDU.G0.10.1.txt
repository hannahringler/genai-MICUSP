Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper and some feedback, focusing on clarity, organization, use of theory, and overall impact:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Good grasp of the theories:** You demonstrate a clear understanding of Marcia's identity development theory and Piaget's stages of cognitive development. You accurately define the concepts and terminology.
*   **Application to the examples:** You make a solid attempt to connect the theories to specific observations and statements from the *7 Up* documentary. You provide examples to illustrate your points.
*   **Clear writing style:** The writing is generally clear and easy to follow. The sentences are well-structured, and the vocabulary is appropriate for an academic paper.
*   **Logical structure:** The paper is organized logically, discussing Andrew through Marcia's theory and John through Piaget's.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Depth of Analysis:** While you identify the correct stages and theories, sometimes the analysis feels a bit superficial.  You could delve deeper into *why* a particular behavior or statement aligns with a specific stage.
    *   **Example:**  When discussing Andrew's interest in the stock market as potentially influenced by his father, you could explore further how adopting parental interests (without personal exploration) directly relates to foreclosure.
*   **Counterarguments and Nuance:**  A stronger paper acknowledges potential limitations or alternative interpretations.
    *   **Example:**  While you classify John as being in the formal operations stage, you could mention that some of his views seem simplistic or lack a full understanding of real-world complexities. This shows critical thinking.
*   **Linking to the Documentary:** You assume the reader is familiar with the *7 Up* documentary. A few *very brief* reminders of the specific scene or context can strengthen your analysis.

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   **Sharpen the Thesis:** While the opening is good, consider a more explicit thesis statement that outlines the *specific argument* you will make about Andrew and John's development based on the chosen theories.  What overall conclusions will you draw?
    *   **Briefly Introduce the Documentary:** Although the title implies the source, a quick sentence situating the film and its purpose could be helpful for a reader unfamiliar with the series. Something like, "The *7 Up* documentary series follows the lives of several British children from age seven onward..."

2.  **Andrew and Marcia's Theory:**
    *   **Strengthen the Foreclosure Argument:** When discussing Andrew's early interest in the stock market, elaborate on why adopting this interest *without question* aligns with foreclosure. Is there evidence that he actively explored this interest himself, or was it simply a reflection of his father's influence?
    *   **Explain the Transition:** Make the transition between foreclosure and moratorium clearer. Why does his later interest in archeology signal a shift? What specific aspects of archeology distinguish it from his earlier, potentially foreclosed, interest?
    *   **Connect Moratorium to Exploration:** You mention exploration but could explain *how* Andrew is exploring.  What questions is he asking himself? How is he seeking information?
    *   **Address Potential Criticisms:** Could Andrew's behavior be interpreted differently? A brief acknowledgment of alternative perspectives strengthens your analysis.

3.  **John and Piaget's Theory:**
    *   **Deepen the Analysis of the Grandmother Story:** While you correctly identify John's understanding of cause and effect, consider exploring the *limitations* of his reasoning. Is he overgeneralizing from a single anecdote? Does his interpretation lack nuance or consideration of other factors?
    *   **Connect Abstract Reasoning to Politics:** When discussing John's political ambitions, make a more explicit connection between his ability to understand abstract concepts (like ruthlessness vs. strength of mind) and his potential success in politics. How does this cognitive development enable him to formulate political strategies or understand complex social issues?
    *   **Expand on Idealism vs. Realism:** You mention John's idealistic views and their potential impracticality. This is a good point! Elaborate on *why* his views are unrealistic. What specific challenges or complexities does he fail to consider?

4.  **Conclusion:**
    *   **Avoid Simply Restating:** The conclusion should synthesize your findings and offer a broader perspective. What are the implications of your analysis? What can be learned from studying Andrew and John's development through these theoretical lenses?
    *   **Address Limitations:** Acknowledge the limitations of applying these theories to real-life individuals. Are there other factors that might influence development? Are the theories universally applicable, or are they culturally bound?
    *   **Suggest Further Research:** Could the analysis be expanded by considering other theoretical perspectives?

**Additional Tips:**

*   **Proofread carefully:**  Pay close attention to grammar and spelling.
*   **Use direct quotes strategically:**  A few well-chosen quotes from the *7 Up* documentary can add weight to your analysis.

**In summary:** This is a good start! By adding more depth to your analysis, considering alternative perspectives, and refining your conclusion, you can elevate this paper to a higher level.
