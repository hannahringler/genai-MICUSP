Here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on clarity, argumentation, and potential areas for strengthening the analysis:

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** The paper establishes a clear thesis: that capitalism acts as a historical agent in Foucault's *Discipline and Punish* and Cronon's *Nature's Metropolis*, but this understanding requires examining capitalism's historical development.
*   **Good Summarization:** The paper does a good job of summarizing key arguments from Foucault and Cronon.
*   **Critical Engagement:** The paper challenges the "ahistorical" conception of capitalism presented in these works.
*   **Coherent Structure:** The paper follows a logical progression: introducing Foucault, highlighting the role of capitalism, comparing it to Cronon, and then raising a critique.
*   **Well-Written:** The paper is generally well-written and demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material.

**Areas for Improvement and Suggestions:**

1.  **Deepen the Argument about Capitalism's Role:**

    *   **Be More Explicit:** While you *state* that capitalism is a driving force, *show* it more explicitly. You mention the time-table and surveillance as related to capitalism, but strengthen the connection by providing more specific examples and elaborating on the mechanisms through which capitalist imperatives directly shaped these disciplinary practices.  How does capitalism's need for efficiency translate directly into the specific forms of time discipline that Foucault describes?
    *   **Nuance:** Avoid portraying capitalism as a monolithic, all-powerful entity. Acknowledge internal tensions and variations within capitalism itself. Were all capitalists aligned in their desires and methods?
    *   **Counterarguments:** Address potential counterarguments. For example, someone might argue that the disciplines originated in religious institutions or military contexts and were only later appropriated by capitalism.  How would you respond to that?

2.  **Strengthen the Cronon Comparison:**

    *   **Elaborate on Similarities and Differences:** The paper mentions Cronon, but it can be strengthened by more explicitly comparing and contrasting Foucault's and Cronon's approaches. What aspects of Cronon's analysis *most* resemble Foucault's portrayal of capitalist structures? How do their methodologies or focuses differ?
    *   **Specific Examples from Cronon:** Go beyond simply saying Chicago's location was "felicitous." Explain how the capitalist drive to maximize profit and efficiency *directly* led to the exploitation of natural resources and the marginalization of certain communities in the hinterland, as Cronon describes.

3.  **Develop the Critique of "Ahistorical" Capitalism:**

    *   **Define "Ahistorical" More Precisely:** What *specific* aspects of Foucault's and Cronon's accounts do you consider ahistorical? Is it their neglect of capitalism's origins, its internal contradictions, or something else?
    *   **Suggest an Alternative Approach:** What kind of historical analysis *would* be more adequate? Who were some of the key figures, institutions, or events involved in the original development of capitalism? Are there specific historical periods or regions that would be particularly fruitful to examine?
    *   **Connect to your Conclusion:** How would a more historically grounded understanding of capitalism change our ability to resist or reform its negative impacts? Be more explicit about this connection.

4.  **Consider Terminology:**

    *   **"Historical Agent":** The term "historical agent" can be tricky. While useful, it's important to be clear about what you mean by it. Are you suggesting that capitalism has agency in the same way that humans do? Or are you using it as a shorthand for the collective actions and structures that support capitalist expansion?

5.  **Minor Points:**

    *   **Footnotes:** Make sure the footnote formatting is consistent and that all sources are fully cited.

**Revised Structure Suggestion (Optional):**

1.  **Introduction:** State your thesis (as you do now).
2.  **Foucault and Discipline:** Summarize Foucault's argument about the disciplines and provide *specific* examples of how capitalist imperatives shaped them (e.g., the time-table, surveillance). Explicitly state how capitalism seems to act as a non-human agent.
3.  **Cronon and the Hinterland:** Summarize Cronon's argument about Chicago and its hinterland and draw *explicit* parallels to Foucault's account. Show how capitalism similarly appears to drive historical change in Cronon's narrative.
4.  **Critique of Ahistorical Approach:** Present your critique of Foucault and Cronon's "ahistorical" portrayal of capitalism.
5.  **Towards a More Historical Understanding:** Briefly outline what a more historically grounded analysis of capitalism would entail.
6.  **Conclusion:** Reiterate your thesis and emphasize the importance of understanding capitalism's origins for contemporary political projects.

By strengthening these areas, you can elevate your paper from a good analysis to a compelling and insightful critique of these important works. Good luck!
