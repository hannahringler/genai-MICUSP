Okay, I've reviewed the paper you've provided (through OCR).  Here's a breakdown of feedback, focusing on strengths, areas for improvement, and specific suggestions:

**Overall Impression**

The paper tackles a complex and important issue: the limitations of the legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, particularly the under-recognition of non-sexualized, gender-based harassment (sexist harassment). The paper demonstrates a good grasp of the legal history, relevant theories, and empirical research in the area. It is well-organized and uses citations appropriately.

**Strengths**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The paper clearly states its central argument that the focus on sexualized behavior in defining sexual harassment is too narrow and overlooks other forms of sex-based discrimination, hindering its recognition and addressing.
*   **Strong Legal Background:** The review of Title VII, EEOC guidelines, and relevant court cases is thorough and well-integrated into the argument.
*   **Good Theoretical Framework:** The paper presents a comprehensive overview of different theoretical perspectives on sexual harassment (natural/biological, organizational, individual differences, and sociocultural).
*   **Solid Research Review:** The discussion of the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ) and relevant research on prevalence, targets, and effects of sexual harassment is informative and relevant to the central argument.
*   **Well-Organized Structure:** The paper follows a logical structure, starting with the legal history, then moving to theoretical frameworks and empirical research, making it easy to follow the argument.
*   **Appropriate Use of Citations:** The paper uses citations effectively to support claims and acknowledge sources.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Deeper Analysis and Synthesis:** While the paper presents information well, it could benefit from deeper analysis and synthesis. Go beyond summarizing existing literature and offer more original insights, connections, and critiques.
*   **Strengthening the Argumentative Edge:** While the paper clearly argues that non-sexualized harassment is under-recognized, it could benefit from a more forceful and persuasive tone. More clearly articulate the consequences of this narrow focus and why it is crucial to broaden the definition.
*   **Addressing Counterarguments:** A stronger paper would acknowledge and address potential counterarguments. For example, is there a reason why the legal definition *should* be narrowly focused? What are the practical difficulties of broadening the definition?
*   **Future Directions:** While the paper mentions future research directions, it could be more specific about what those directions should be. What are the most pressing questions that need to be addressed? What methodologies would be most effective?

**Specific Suggestions**

**Introduction:**

*   **Hook:** Start with a more compelling hook to grab the reader's attention. A striking statistic, a relevant news story, or a provocative question could be used.
*   **Clarify Scope:** State explicitly that this paper will focus on *gender harassment* and its specific exclusion.

**Legal History:**

*   **"Sexual Harassment... Not so Sexual???"**: Change the title to something more informative and less rhetorical.
*   **Critique Legal Reasoning:** Analyze *why* the courts have been reluctant to recognize non-sexualized harassment. What are the underlying assumptions or concerns that drive this reluctance?
*   **Illustrative Examples:** Provide more specific examples of the types of non-sexualized behaviors that are often overlooked (e.g., consistently being given less challenging tasks, having ideas dismissed, being subjected to demeaning jokes).
*   **Discuss Intersectionality**: Acknowledge how gender-based harassment can intersect with other forms of discrimination (race, class, sexual orientation).

**Theoretical Framework:**

*   **Connect Theories to the Argument:** Explicitly link each theoretical perspective to the central argument about the under-recognition of non-sexualized harassment. For example, how do sociocultural theories explain why this type of harassment is often dismissed or normalized?
*   **Critique the Theories:** Offer some critical analysis of the theories themselves. Are there limitations to these perspectives? Are some more helpful than others in understanding the issue?
*   **Explain the Connection Between Theory and Research** How do theoretical frameworks shape the questions that researchers ask and the methodologies that they use?

**Research Review:**

*   **Focus on Gender Harassment in the SEQ:** When discussing the SEQ, give more emphasis to the gender harassment subscale and its implications.
*   **Critique the Reliance on the SEQ:** Acknowledge potential limitations of the SEQ as a measure of sexual harassment. Are there biases in the scale? Does it adequately capture the nuances of different types of harassment?
*   **Highlight Research Gaps:** Emphasize the gaps in research on non-sexualized harassment. What questions have *not* been adequately addressed?

**Conclusion:**

*   **Restate Thesis (Concise):** Briefly restate the paper's main argument in a clear and concise way.
*   **Implications and Recommendations:** Be specific about the practical implications of your findings. What changes need to be made in legal definitions, organizational policies, and social attitudes?
*   **Call to Action:** End with a strong call to action, urging further research, policy changes, and increased awareness of the issue.
*   **Limitations:** Acknowledge the limitations of your own paper.

**Other Considerations**

*   **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper carefully for any grammatical errors or typos.
*   **Format Consistently:** Ensure that your citations and references are formatted consistently according to a specific style guide (e.g., APA, MLA).

**In summary, this is a well-researched and well-organized paper that addresses a significant issue. By deepening the analysis, strengthening the argumentative edge, addressing counterarguments, and being more specific about future directions, you can elevate the paper to an even higher level.**

I hope this feedback is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
