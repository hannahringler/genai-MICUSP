Okay, here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, along with suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

This is a well-structured, thoughtful, and sophisticated piece of academic writing. It demonstrates a strong grasp of Locke's *Second Treatise*, engages with existing scholarship, and proposes an original interpretation. The paper is well-organized and clearly articulates its argument.  The writing is generally clear and precise.

**Strengths**

*   **Original Argument:** The paper's central thesis – that Locke's social contract should be understood not as a strictly historical-material process but as a developmental process analogous to a boy becoming a man – is innovative and insightful. This offers a fresh perspective on Locke.
*   **Close Reading:** The paper meticulously analyzes Locke's text, providing ample textual evidence to support its claims. The repeated references to specific sections of the *Second Treatise* strengthen the argument.
*   **Engagement with Scholarship:** The paper explicitly acknowledges and engages with existing interpretations of Locke, particularly those that emphasize property's role. It clearly outlines where it agrees and disagrees with these interpretations. The reference to Ashcraft provides a broader context for the argument.
*   **Coherent Structure:** The paper follows a logical progression. It begins by outlining the problem, then critiques alternative interpretations, presents its own interpretation, and draws out the implications.
*   **Strong Writing:** The writing is generally academic and precise. The author displays a strong command of the language.

**Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Overselling the "Newness":** While the argument is compelling, phrases like "received little to no attention in dominant interpretations" can be toned down. It's possible other scholars have touched on similar ideas (perhaps less centrally). You could soften these claims.

*   **Footnote 1:** “Unlike the temporal character of nature, property, and government, Locke is not ambiguous in regards to his labour theory of property: “The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his,” so that when a man mixes his labour with that which is in “the common state nature hath placed it in,” the object of his labour loses its common right and becomes the labourer's private right (ST, 19).”

    This feels a bit like a tangent and could be incorporated more directly into the main argument if its relevance is crucial, or removed altogether if it's not directly supporting the core thesis.

*   **Footnote 2:**
    *Note that I use the masculine pronoun here and elsewhere, as I am referring to Locke's theory, where the individual is always male.*

    This comment is fine, but could be made more powerful. Instead of simply noting this, consider briefly connecting this to broader feminist critiques of Enlightenment philosophy or the exclusion of women from the public sphere. This would give it more weight and demonstrate further critical awareness.

*   **Overreliance on Long Quotations:** While textual evidence is important, the paper sometimes relies on lengthy quotations. Consider paraphrasing more of the material while retaining key phrases to support your interpretation. This will make the argument flow more smoothly and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the text.

*   **Clarifying the "Boy to Man" Analogy:** While the "boy to man" analogy is intriguing, the paper could benefit from a more explicit and detailed explanation of how this process mirrors Locke's social contract. What specific aspects of the transition from childhood to adulthood are relevant to the argument? More concretely, how does the shift in power dynamics from parental to individual align with a revolutionary act?

*   **Addressing Potential Counterarguments:** The paper could be strengthened by anticipating and addressing potential counterarguments. For example, some might argue that even with an expansive definition of property, the protection of alienable property (goods, estates) still plays a significant role in motivating individuals to enter civil society.

*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion could be slightly more robust. It reiterates the paper's main points but could benefit from a more forceful statement of the implications of the argument. How does this new interpretation of Locke change our understanding of his political philosophy, or of the Enlightenment more broadly?

*   **Typos:** The paper spells “bibliography” wrong, and uses "SI" at points where it appears that "ST" should be used.

**Specific Examples:**

*   **Page 4:** "At this point in my interpretation of Locke, I diverge significantly from the common interpretation..." – Consider rephrasing to sound less boastful and more scholarly. Example: "While this paper engages with common interpretations of Locke..."

*   **Page 8:** "...an expansive, Lockean property for which I have been arguing..." – Consider rephrasing as "...the expansive Lockean conception of property presented in this paper..."

**Suggestions**
*   **Provide more nuance to the boy-to-man analogy.**  Perhaps consider the role of education, responsibility, and the ability to reason as key factors that transition a boy into a man and how these relate to the individual's capacity to participate in a commonwealth.
*   **Expand on historical implications:** Explore the degree to which specific historical conditions, like social stratification and patriarchy, shaped Locke's arguments.
*   **Engage further with contemporary political discourse:**  How might Locke's arguments be used or misused in contemporary political debates?
*   **Offer specific examples where your interpretation differs from the dominant readings.** For instance, could you contrast how a certain historical event or Locke's approach to taxation is understood under a material interpretation versus your boy-to-man interpretation?

**In summary:** This is a very strong paper. The suggestions above are primarily aimed at refining the argument, anticipating potential criticisms, and maximizing the impact of the analysis. Good job!
