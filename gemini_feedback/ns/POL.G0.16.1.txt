Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper with feedback and suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

The paper addresses an important topic and demonstrates a basic understanding of the involvement of international organizations in combating human trafficking. However, it could be significantly strengthened by:

*   **Deeper Analysis:** Moving beyond descriptive summaries to provide more critical analysis of the effectiveness, limitations, and potential of each organization.
*   **Stronger Argument:** Formulating a clear thesis statement and consistently arguing it throughout the paper.
*   **More Specific Recommendations:** The policy recommendations are somewhat general. More concrete and actionable suggestions would be beneficial.
*   **Improved Structure and Flow:** While the structure is logical, the transitions between sections could be smoother.

**Specific Feedback**

**1. Introduction (Page 1)**

*   **Stronger Thesis:** Needs a clear thesis statement. What is the central argument you are making about the role of international organizations in addressing human trafficking? Is it that they are effective, ineffective, have potential but are underutilized, or face specific challenges? This needs to be stated explicitly.
*   **Brief Overview:**  Briefly preview the organizations you'll be discussing (UN, EU, US).

**2. Background of Policy Issue (Page 2)**

*   **Solid Introduction:** A good overview of human trafficking and its global context.
*   **Link to International Organizations:** Strengthen the connection to the role of international organizations. How does this background information specifically relate to their involvement?
*   **Consider this statement:** "Increasingly, people do not want to wait until problems in distant parts of the world spread to their own area and are beginning to pressure their government, the United Nations, and international organizations to act on problems before they get to out of hand" Is this statement completely accurate? In what situations might the public not be pressing for action?
*   **Clarify the last paragraph.** State which states have a potential for more trafficking victims.

**3. The United Nations (Pages 3-5)**

*   **Descriptive:** Largely descriptive of the UN's structure and functions. Needs more critical analysis.
*   **Effectiveness Analysis:** Discuss specific UN initiatives related to human trafficking. Are they working? What are the challenges? What are the success stories?
*   **Sovereignty Concerns:** You mention states' reluctance to cede sovereignty. This is a crucial point. Elaborate on how this hinders the UN's ability to combat trafficking.
*   **Connect Different UN Organs:** Is there coordination and communication between the General Assembly, Security Council, ECOSOC, and Secretariat on this issue?
*   **Link to causes.** Expand on the final paragraph of the United Nations. Is the UN not addressing the causes and instead focusing on the migration of victims?

**4. The European Union (Page 6-7)**

*   **More Analysis:**  Similar to the UN section, needs more analysis of specific EU anti-trafficking policies and their impact.
*   **EU's Unique Position:**  Highlight what makes the EU's approach different from the UN's. You mention the EU's ability to enforce policies on member states. Explore this further. Give examples.
*   **"Economic Power":**  How is the EU using its economic power to combat trafficking? Be specific.

**5. The United States (Pages 7-8)**

*   **Complicated Relationship:** You rightly point out the US's complex relationship with the UN.
*   **US Policy:** Discuss specific US laws and initiatives (e.g., Trafficking Victims Protection Act).
*   **Effectiveness of US Aid:** Is US aid truly effective in combating trafficking, or does it sometimes have unintended consequences?
*   **The last sentence is a bit too vague.** Consider re-wording it.

**6. Policy Recommendations (Pages 9-10)**

*   **Too General:**  The recommendations are too broad.
*   **Address Root Causes:** You mention addressing the circumstances that make people vulnerable to trafficking, which is excellent. How can international organizations do this effectively?
*   **Specific Actions:** Instead of just saying "educating local law enforcement," suggest concrete training programs or strategies.
*   **Economic Element:** Elaborate on the "economic element" mentioned on page 9. What specific economic incentives or penalties could be used?
*   **Corruption:** How can international organizations effectively combat corruption, which you identify as a key factor? This is a difficult challenge, so acknowledge the complexities.
*   **More specific recommendations for Security Council.

**7. Conclusion (Page 11)**

*   **Reiterate Thesis:** Restate your thesis (the argument you've been making throughout the paper).
*   **Summarize Key Points:** Briefly summarize the main points from each section.
*   **Call to Action:** End with a strong call to action or a statement about the future of international efforts to combat human trafficking.
*   **Mention specific areas of investment.

**8. Bibliography (Page 12)**

*   **Formatting:** Make sure your citations and bibliography are formatted consistently according to a specific style (e.g., MLA, Chicago, APA).
*   **Sources:** Consider including a wider range of sources, including academic journals, reports from international organizations, and news articles.

**Specific Examples of Improvements**

*   **Instead of:** "The United Nations must continue to promote this problem to member states..."
*   **Try:** "The United Nations should strengthen its advocacy efforts by hosting regional workshops for member states, focusing on best practices for identifying and prosecuting traffickers and providing victim support."

*   **Instead of:** "Educating local law enforcement..."
*   **Try:** "International organizations should provide funding and training to local law enforcement agencies in high-risk countries, focusing on investigative techniques, victim identification, and ethical conduct. These programs should be designed in collaboration with local communities to ensure cultural sensitivity and build trust."

**Additional Tips**

*   **Primary vs. Secondary Sources:** Try to use a balance of primary and secondary sources. Primary sources are original documents (e.g., UN resolutions, EU directives), while secondary sources are analyses of those documents.
*   **Objectivity:** While it's important to have an opinion, strive for objectivity in your analysis. Acknowledge different perspectives and potential limitations of your arguments.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Ensure your paper is free of grammatical errors and typos.

By addressing these points, you can elevate your paper from a descriptive overview to a more insightful and impactful analysis of the role of international organizations in combating human trafficking. Good luck!
