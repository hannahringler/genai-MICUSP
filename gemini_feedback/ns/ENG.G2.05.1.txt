Okay, here's a breakdown of feedback, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and specific areas for improvement, based on a standard academic essay critique:

**Overall Impressions**

*   **Strong and Intelligent:** This is clearly a very thoughtful and well-researched essay. The writer demonstrates a strong grasp of the primary texts, secondary criticism, and relevant theoretical frameworks (Bhabha).
*   **Clear Thesis:** The essay has a clearly defined scope and the writer states the purpose is to explore how people are represented as reading Alban or instructed to do so in a certain way.
*   **Good Structure:** The essay has a logical structure. The introduction sets the stage, each body paragraph focuses on a specific text or aspect of the argument, and there's a clear progression.
*   **Solid Evidence:** The writer uses textual evidence effectively to support claims. Quotes are integrated well and analyzed thoughtfully.

**Strengths**

*   **Sophisticated Argument:** The essay grapples with complex issues of national identity, religious continuity, and the role of textuality vs. materiality. The analysis of performativity is particularly strong.
*   **Close Reading Skills:** The writer demonstrates impressive close reading skills, paying attention to nuances of language and rhetoric. The analysis of the use of "protomartyr" vs. "ringleader" is excellent.
*   **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The essay successfully integrates literary analysis with historical and architectural contexts. This adds depth and richness to the argument.
*   **Engaging with Scholarship:** The essay appropriately cites and engages with relevant secondary scholarship to support claims and build upon existing research.

**Weaknesses**

*   **Clarity/Focus at times**: Sometimes the writer engages with the historical context for so long that it can be difficult to see how that background information leads to any conclusions the writer is trying to make, or how that background information addresses the central claim of this paper.
*   **Overly Dense:** At times, the writing style can be overly dense and complex. Some sentences are long and convoluted, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument. The use of jargon could be toned down in some places.
*   **Further explanation is needed in conclusions:** At times the claims that are made at the end of paragraphs do not have as much explanation or argumentation leading up to them as they could have.
*   **Occasional Abrupt Transitions:** While the structure is generally good, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.

**Specific Areas for Improvement & Suggestions**

1.  **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   **Simplify Sentence Structure:** Break down long, complex sentences into shorter, more manageable ones.
    *   **Define Terms More Explicitly:** While the writer demonstrates a good understanding of theoretical concepts, not all readers may be familiar with them. Provide brief, clear definitions of key terms (e.g., "performativity") when they are first introduced.
    *   **Reduce Jargon:** Consider whether every instance of jargon is truly necessary. Can you express the same idea in simpler, more accessible language?
2.  **Strengthen Transitions:**
    *   **Use Transition Words/Phrases:** Employ transition words and phrases (e.g., "however," "in addition," "therefore," "on the other hand") to signal the relationship between ideas and paragraphs.
    *   **Summarize Previous Points:** At the beginning of a new paragraph, briefly summarize the main point of the previous paragraph and how it connects to the current topic.

3.  **Elaboration on Claims:**
    *   **Example for claim in Conclusion:** While it is noted that it is interesting that each of these texts, in order to emphasize some grouping of the above exemplarities, foregrounds a type of textuality as either an extension of or replacement of Alban's material existence as the abbey itself, it would be useful for the writer to take a moment to use evidence from previous claims to show how this conclusion is accurate.
4.  **Introduction & Conclusion:**
    *   **Revisit Introduction:** To make this paper even more successful, the writer should include more information on why he chose these three readings of St. Alban.
    *   **Conclusion:** Similarly, in the conclusion the writer should take the time to make overarching claims on the specificities of the way these texts engage with their audiences.

**Other Minor Points**

*   **Proofreading:** Double-check for any typos or grammatical errors.
*   **Formatting:** Ensure that all citations are formatted consistently according to the chosen style guide (MLA, Chicago, etc.).

**In summary, this is a strong and insightful essay that demonstrates a high level of critical thinking and research skills. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, the writer can make the argument even clearer, more persuasive, and more accessible to a wider audience.**
