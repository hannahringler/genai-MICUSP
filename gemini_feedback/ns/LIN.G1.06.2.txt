Okay, I've reviewed the document you uploaded, which appears to be a research proposal focusing on perceptions of authors based on their text style in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Here's my feedback, broken down into different categories:

**Overall Impression**

*   **Strong Foundation:** The proposal demonstrates a good understanding of the existing literature on language attitudes, sociolinguistics, and CMC. It identifies a gap in the research (specifically, the systematic study of text style as a social cue in CMC) and proposes a study to address it.
*   **Clear Research Questions:** The research questions are clearly stated and relevant to the identified gap.
*   **Well-Defined Methodology:** The proposed methodology (experimental design, independent and dependent variables, stimuli, procedure, analysis) is well-defined and appropriate for the research questions.
*   **Feasibility:** The study seems feasible within the constraints of a student project.
*   **Organization:** Generally well-organized, following a standard research proposal format.

**Strengths**

*   **Literature Review:** The literature review is thorough and demonstrates a good grasp of relevant theories and research. It effectively synthesizes existing work and identifies the research gap.
*   **Justification:** The proposal clearly justifies the need for the research and explains its potential contribution to the field.
*   **Independent Variables:** The choice and operationalization of the independent variables (punctuation, capitalization, letter repetition, author) are well-reasoned and relevant to the research questions. The justification for those variables is good.
*   **Dependent Variables:** The inclusion of both quantitative and qualitative measures is a strength, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of subjects' perceptions.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The proposal mentions consent and aims for a realistic online setting, suggesting an awareness of ethical considerations.
*   **Analysis Plan:** The proposed analysis plan (MANOVA, factor analysis, content analysis) is appropriate for the data and research questions.

**Areas for Improvement**

*   **Hypotheses:** While the proposal mentions that it is guided by broad research questions rather than specific hypotheses due to the paucity of prior experimental research, it might be helpful to formulate some tentative hypotheses or expectations based on the existing literature. This would provide a clearer focus for the study and guide the analysis. This could also potentially strengthen the work.
*   **Stimuli Examples:** While the proposal mentions providing examples of stimuli in Appendix B, it could benefit from including a few representative examples within the main body of the proposal. This would help the reader better understand the nature of the stimuli and the manipulations being made. The operationalization in 4.4 is good, but examples would cement it.
*   **Operationalization Specificity:** While the operationalization of independent variables is generally good, it could be made more specific. For example, under "Email - Punctuation - Nonstandard," you could provide examples of what sentences would look like with omitted commas or apostrophes. This would improve clarity and replicability.
*   **Context Condition:** What if the subject's perception of age or gender is incorrect? Do you plan to analyze how these mismatches, if any, might impact subject's perceptions? You might want to include a discussion of this issue.
*   **Power Analysis:** The proposal mentions aiming for 20 subjects per stimuli set (640 total) but doesn't provide a rationale for this number. It would be helpful to include a brief power analysis to justify the sample size. This would demonstrate that the study has sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful effects.
*   **Limitations:** The proposal should acknowledge potential limitations of the study. For example, the reliance on constructed messages (rather than naturalistic data) could be seen as a limitation, as could the focus on internet users. By acknowledging these limitations, the proposal would demonstrate a critical awareness of the study's scope.
*   **"I":** Avoid starting sentences with "I". Rewrite the sentences to be objective and academic in tone.

**Specific Suggestions**

*   **Literature Expansion:** While the literature review is strong, consider expanding it to include recent work on online identity and impression management. This would further strengthen the theoretical foundation of the proposal.
*   **Questionnaire Details:** Provide more detail about the specific questions that will be included in the questionnaire. This would give the reader a better sense of the types of data that will be collected.
*   **Recruitment Strategy:** Elaborate on the specific strategies that will be used to recruit subjects online. This would demonstrate that the study is feasible and that the sample will be representative of the target population. For example, you'd need to clarify how you plan to recruit teenagers and the elderly in person.
*   **Timeline:** Consider adding a brief timeline outlining the key stages of the research (e.g., stimuli development, data collection, analysis, writing).

**Typos and Grammar**

*   There may be some typos or grammatical errors, particularly near the beginning of the document. Please review thoroughly for any issues.

**In summary:**

This is a well-structured and thoughtful research proposal with a solid foundation. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, you can further strengthen the proposal and increase its likelihood of success. Good luck!
