Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper is well-organized and clearly structured. It demonstrates a good level of reflection on the student's experiences in the linguistics course and volunteer placement. The student effectively connects personal experiences to broader concepts discussed in class. The writing is generally clear and easy to understand.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper has a clear introduction, body paragraphs with specific topics, and a conclusion. This makes it easy to follow the student's train of thought.
*   **Personal Reflection:** The student effectively incorporates personal experiences and reflections throughout the paper. This adds depth and authenticity to the analysis.
*   **Connection to Course Material:** The student makes connections between their experiences and concepts learned in the linguistics course. This demonstrates an understanding of the course material and its relevance to real-world situations.
*   **Honest Assessment:** The student is honest about their initial skepticism, their challenges, and their evolving understanding of language learning and service learning. This adds credibility to the paper.
*   **Specific Examples:** The student provides specific examples from their volunteer experience, such as the "magic box" and their interview with Heather. These examples help to illustrate their points.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Some Generalizations:** While the paper uses specific examples, there could be more nuance in certain areas. For instance, when the student mentions the University's commitment to diversity, further details could be added.
*   **Pronoun issues:** "Use to" is used improperly a few times.
*   **Clich√© alert:** "Privilege backpack" is overly cliche.
*   **Awkward Phrasing:** Some sentences could be phrased more clearly and concisely.
*   **Typos:** There are a few errors that could be found with a basic proof read.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Expand on Generalizations:** Instead of simply stating that the University is known for its commitment to diversity, provide some concrete examples of how this commitment is demonstrated (e.g., specific programs, initiatives, policies).

2.  **Refine Sentence Structure:** Pay close attention to sentence structure and clarity. Consider breaking up long sentences into shorter ones to improve readability.

3.  **Proofread Carefully:** Proofread the paper carefully for any typos, grammatical errors, or punctuation mistakes.

4.  **Consider the "So What?" Factor:** For each point, especially regarding the magic box, consider explicitly stating why this observation matters. What larger point does it illustrate?

5.  **Conclusion Could Be Stronger:** The conclusion is a bit abrupt. Consider adding a sentence or two that summarizes the key takeaways from the paper and offers a final thought on the student's overall experience.

**Specific Examples of Edits to Consider:**

*   Original: "This confuses me because the University is known for its commitment to diversity and for them to cut back on a superb ELI program like this one does not back up their commitment."
    *   Revised: "The University's stated commitment to diversity clashes with the reduction in funding for the ELI program, raising questions about how seriously this commitment is taken."

*   Original: "As Americans, we take it for granted because it is an item in our privilege backpack, but in fact English is a difficult language to learn."
    *   Revised: "As native English speakers, it's easy to overlook the challenges of language acquisition, but English presents a complex linguistic system for non-native speakers to master."

*   Original: "I think that this was the best part of the class and should be implemented into all classrooms."
    *   Revised: "The personalized attention offered during the individual meetings proved particularly valuable and this approach should be incorporated into other educational contexts."

**Overall Grade:**

The paper is a strong effort. With some revisions, it could be even better. I would place the grade in the B+ to A- range as it is now.

I hope this feedback is helpful!
