Okay, here's some feedback on your paper regarding Augustus's image, focusing on its strengths and areas for improvement.

**Overall Impression:**

The paper presents a clear argument, comparing and contrasting Suetonius's and Tacitus's portrayals of Augustus. You demonstrate a good understanding of the source material and are able to articulate the key differences in their approaches. The paper is well-structured and generally well-written, showcasing a good level of critical thinking.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis:** You establish early on that you'll be comparing Suetonius' and Tacitus' differing accounts of Augustus, focusing on their contrasting portrayals.
*   **Strong Use of Evidence:** You effectively quote from both Suetonius and Tacitus to support your points, demonstrating close reading and textual analysis.
*   **Comparison and Contrast:** The paper excels at drawing out the specific differences in how each author handles Augustus's life and actions. You effectively highlight Suetonius' more forgiving approach versus Tacitus' more critical and even cynical perspective.
*   **Argumentative Strength:** You present a clear argument that Tacitus's account is more compelling due to its willingness to delve into the less flattering aspects of Augustus's character and reign.
*   **Well-Structured:** The essay follows a logical progression, moving from a general overview to specific examples and then to a conclusion that reinforces your central argument.
*   **Use of scholarly language:** The vocab is fitting and sophisticated.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Deeper Analysis:** While you highlight the differences between the authors, consider exploring *why* these differences exist.
    *   **Authorial Context:** What were Suetonius' and Tacitus' motivations? How might their own backgrounds, biases, or the political climate have influenced their portrayals of Augustus? Exploring the authors' context could add depth to your analysis.
    *   **Target Audience:** Who were their intended audiences? How would that influence their writing and the decisions they made regarding what to include/omit and how to portray Augustus?
    *   **Historiographical Tradition:** Were they part of a particular historiographical tradition or school of thought?
*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While Tacitus' portrayal is undeniably more critical, avoid presenting Suetonius's as simply "positive." He likely had his own agenda or intended effect, so nuance in the analysis of his account will enrich the overall argument. Consider what Suetonius might have been trying to achieve with his more forgiving account.
*   **Consider Counterarguments:** Briefly acknowledging and addressing counterarguments could strengthen your position. For instance, you could acknowledge that some historians find Suetonius' attention to detail and biographical approach valuable, even if it lacks Tacitus' critical edge.

*   **Some Stylistic Tweaks:**
    *   **"i.e."**: While technically correct, overuse of parenthetical "i.e." can sometimes disrupt the flow. Consider rephrasing some sentences to incorporate the clarification more naturally.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Expand on Tacitus' Loathing:** You mention the "loathing present in Tacitus' brief treatment." Give a specific example. Show how the *language* Tacitus uses conveys this loathing.
*   **Explore Suetonius' Motives:** Is Suetonius simply being naive or is there a reason for his more positive spin? Was he writing for a particular patron, or was he trying to promote a certain image of the imperial family?
*   **Connect to Broader Themes:** Consider relating your analysis to broader themes in Roman history. What does the contrasting portrayal of Augustus tell us about the challenges of historical interpretation, the nature of power, or the importance of propaganda and image-making?

**Revised conclusion**
The conclusion could be beefed up a bit to summarize what Tacitus's and Suetonius' writing reveals about historical interpretation and the subjective lenses through which history can be written.

*Example of revised conclusion:*
"In conclusion, Tacitus' and Suetonius's works reveal how the complexities of historical interpretation hinge on the authors' subjective lenses and broader political and social contexts. While Suetonius seemingly sought to preserve the legacy of Augustus, Tacitus, with his cynical perspective, attempted to unveil the unadulterated truth and ultimately offered a more believable account.

**In summary:**

This is a well-written and insightful paper that demonstrates a solid grasp of the material. By adding more depth to your analysis, exploring the authors' motivations, and acknowledging counterarguments, you can elevate this paper to an even higher level. Good job!
