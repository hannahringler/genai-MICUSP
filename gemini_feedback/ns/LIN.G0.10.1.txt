Okay, I can provide feedback on this paper.  To give the *most* helpful feedback, it would be beneficial to know:

*   **What was the prompt/assignment?**  Knowing the assignment's specific requirements (e.g., length, specific things to address, intended audience) will help me judge the paper's effectiveness.
*   **What level is the writer?** Is this a first-year undergraduate, a more advanced student, or a graduate student? My expectations will be different depending on the writer's experience.
*   **What are your (or the writer's) specific concerns?** What areas do you (or the writer) feel are the weakest? Are there any specific things you're unsure about?

However, I can still give some general feedback based on the text provided.

**Overall Impressions:**

The paper outlines a well-thought-out lesson plan designed to help second language learners navigate an academic text (the University of Michigan LS&A Bulletin). The approach is logical, and the rationale for each step is clearly explained. The paper demonstrates an understanding of discourse analysis, schema theory, and second language acquisition principles.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Structure:** The paper is well-organized. The introduction clearly states the purpose and context of the lesson. The body paragraphs explain each stage of the lesson (pre-reading, skimming, detailed interaction, final task) in a structured manner.
*   **Logical Rationale:** Each stage of the lesson is justified with reference to specific learning goals and second language acquisition principles. The writer explains *why* they chose to structure the lesson in this way.
*   **Specific Examples:** The paper refers to the LS&A Bulletin and provides concrete examples of how students will interact with the text.
*   **Awareness of Challenges:** The writer acknowledges potential difficulties that students might face (e.g., vocabulary comprehension, remembering all the requirements for a degree) and addresses how the lesson aims to mitigate these challenges.
*   **Focus on Practical Application:** The lesson emphasizes using the text as a resource, which is a valuable skill for second language learners.
*   **Connection to Theory:** The paper makes explicit links to schema theory, discourse analysis, and relevant concepts in second language acquisition.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** While the writing is generally clear, some sentences and paragraphs could be more concise and direct. For example, phrases like "From my experience with second language learning classes, it seems that there is a primary focus on..." could be more direct, e.g., "Second language learning classes often focus on..."
*   **Elaboration on Potential Challenges:** While the writer acknowledges potential difficulties, they could elaborate further on specific challenges related to vocabulary and the complex requirements for a degree.  How *specifically* will the lesson address these challenges?
*   **Engagement of Students:** While the paper mentions students will 'interact', the explanation of student engagement could be further elaborated. How does the lesson specifically foster active participation? How will you handle different paces among the students? How does the lesson plan ensure that it facilitates different learning styles?
*   **Consider Including Specific Examples of Questions/Tasks:** The paper would be strengthened by including a few specific examples of the questions and tasks that students will be asked to complete in each stage of the lesson. This would make the lesson plan more tangible and easier to evaluate.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Page 1:** "When confronted with any text, a person inadvertently uses previously formed schemata..."  Consider rephrasing to be more active and less passive ("People automatically use previously formed schemata...")
*   **Page 2:** "In class the students will be introduced to this university catalogue..."  Rephrase: "In class, students will be introduced to..." (avoiding the somewhat awkward phrasing).
*   **Page 3:** "With this credibility students might assume that the contents are informative, accurate, and important..."  Consider: "This credibility leads students to assume..."
*   **Page 4:** "I also want the students to see the functionality of the guide so I pose questions that will make them interact independently with the text." Be more specific; what kind of questions do you ask to have them interact independently with the text?

**Overall Recommendation:**

This is a strong paper that demonstrates a solid understanding of the relevant concepts and principles. The lesson plan is well-designed and logically justified. By addressing the areas for improvement outlined above, the writer can further strengthen the paper and make the lesson plan even more effective.

**If you can provide the assignment prompt or specific concerns, I can offer more targeted feedback.**
