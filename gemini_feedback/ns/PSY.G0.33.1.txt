Here's some feedback on the paper, focusing on structure, clarity, argumentation, and mechanics:

**Overall Impressions:**

The paper is well-organized and addresses the prompt effectively. The student uses personal experiences and external sources (the Big Five test and Peter Grey's theories) to analyze the development of their personality. The writing is generally clear, but there are areas where it can be improved for better conciseness and impact.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Introduction:** The introduction effectively sets the stage by stating the purpose of the paper and giving a brief overview of the methods used (taking the Big Five test, having family and a stranger take it).
*   **Logical Structure:** The paper follows a logical progression: self-assessment, comparison with family/stranger, and discussion of contributing factors (genetics, environment, sibling dynamics).
*   **Use of Evidence:** The paper uses the results from the Big Five test as evidence to support claims about the student's personality and the influences of genetics and environment.
*   **Incorporation of Theory:** The paper successfully integrates theoretical concepts like sibling contrast and split parent identification to explain the observed patterns.
*   **Clear Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the findings and provides a clear takeaway: the student's personality is a product of both environment and genetics.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Clarity and Precision:**
    *   "The results of the tests allude to the facts that my personality is not my fault, just bad genes as well as I am just a product of my environment." - This sentence is a bit convoluted. Consider rephrasing: "The test results suggest that both genetics and environment have played significant roles in shaping my personality."
    *   "I believe that the Big Five personality model factors test was fairy accurate in how I would describe myself." - Replace "fairy" with "fairly."
*   **Conciseness:**
    *   "This trait reflects the tendency to experience negative thoughts and feelings. High scorers are prone to insecurity and emotional distress and low scorers tend to be more relaxed and less emotional." - Could be shortened to: "This trait reflects the tendency to experience negative thoughts and feelings, with high scores indicating greater insecurity and emotional distress, and low scores indicating more relaxed and emotional individuals."
    *   Avoid unnecessary repetition of "personality". For example, "My results of the Big Five personality model factors test made me realize two things about my personality." - Consider: "The Big Five test results revealed two important aspects of my personality..."
*   **Depth of Analysis:**
    *   While you mention that you expected to be higher in neuroticism and lower in openness, you could expand on *why* your initial perceptions were wrong.
    *   Dig deeper into the meaning of the results. What does it *mean* to be low in neuroticism in your case? How does that affect your life? How does being average in openness influence your decisions?
*   **Referencing:**
    *   Provide more information when referencing Grey's theory. Who is Peter Grey? What field of psychology is he known for? Give context.

**Specific Suggestions by Section:**

*   **Introduction:** Good. Strong statement of purpose.
*   **Self-Assessment:**  Elaborate on *why* you thought you'd score higher in neuroticism and lower in openness. Tie it back to specific behaviors or thoughts.
*   **Family Comparison:** The discussion of parental personalities is interesting, but it could be more directly linked to the student's own personality. For example: "My mother's high agreeableness score is reflected in my own high score in this area, suggesting a potential influence from my upbringing."
*   **Sibling Dynamics:**  Expand on the specific personality differences with your brother to make the example more compelling.
*   **Conclusion:** Solid summary.

**Grammar/Mechanics:**

*   Proofread carefully for typos and minor grammatical errors.

**Revised example:**

Original: "The results of the tests allude to the facts that my personality is not my fault, just bad genes as well as I am just a product of my environment."

Revised: "The test results suggest that both genetics and environment have played significant roles in shaping my personality."

**Overall Grade:**

I'd estimate that this paper is currently a B+ or A- level. With revisions addressing the points above, it could easily be elevated to an A.
