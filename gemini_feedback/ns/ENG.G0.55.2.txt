Okay, here's some feedback on your paper about the illustrations in *Persepolis*.  Overall, it's a thoughtful and well-organized essay that effectively argues its central point: Satrapi's use of graphics is a powerful and deliberate choice that enhances the narrative and conveys complex ideas in ways that words alone cannot.

Here's a breakdown of strengths and areas for improvement:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Thesis and Argument:** The essay clearly states its thesis early on and maintains a consistent focus on how the illustrations contribute to *Persepolis's* meaning.
*   **Strong Analysis:** You effectively analyze specific examples from the text (e.g., the depiction of the veil, the image of her mother demonstrating, the "behind the walls" image) to support your claims.  You go beyond simply describing the images and delve into their symbolic significance and impact on the reader.
*   **Use of Critical Sources:** You integrate critical perspectives (Naghibi, Tensuan, Whitlock) thoughtfully and use them to bolster your argument. You show a good understanding of these critics' ideas and how they relate to your own interpretation.
*   **Well-Organized Structure:** The essay has a logical flow, moving from a general introduction to specific examples and analysis.  The paragraphs are well-developed and focused.
*   **Good Writing:**  The writing is generally clear and concise.  You demonstrate a good command of academic language.
*   **Insightful Points:** You raise interesting points about the effectiveness of visual communication, the way Satrapi connects with readers, and the political implications of her graphic style.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Specificity in the Introduction:** The introduction, while functional, could be more engaging. Instead of simply stating your initial confusion, try to hook the reader with a more compelling statement about the unique power of graphic novels, or the initial biases readers might have towards them.
*   **Elaboration on Connections/Transitions:** While the essay is well-organized, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Try to explicitly connect ideas from one paragraph to the next to maintain a sense of flow.
*   **Deeper Engagement with Critical Perspectives:** While you use your critical sources effectively, consider pushing your analysis further by engaging with their arguments more critically. Do you agree with them completely? Do you see any limitations in their interpretations?  Adding a layer of critical engagement will elevate your analysis.
*   **Nuance and Complexity:** While you argue persuasively that the graphics enhance the narrative, consider acknowledging potential limitations or drawbacks to Satrapi's choice. Are there any instances where the illustrations might be ambiguous or open to misinterpretation?  Introducing a bit of nuance will make your argument more sophisticated.
*   **Conclusion could be stronger:** The conclusion would benefit from a return to the initial problem or question. Also, reiterate the significance of Satrapi's work in today's context.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:** Instead of saying "When I first flipped through…," try something like: "Graphic novels are often dismissed as mere entertainment, yet Marjane Satrapi's *Persepolis* demonstrates the profound power of visual storytelling to convey complex political and personal narratives."
*   **Transitions:** In the paragraph that starts with "Another Formalist critic, Theresa Tensuan…," you could add a sentence like "Building on Naghibi's analysis of resistance, Theresa Tensuan focuses on how the graphics challenge social norms and expectations."
*   **Critical Engagement:** When discussing Whitlock's Marxist argument, you could ask questions such as: "While Whitlock's focus on accessibility is compelling, does it fully account for the potential for misinterpretation across cultures? Or the need for a shared historical context?"
*   **Nuance/Complexity:** You could add a sentence like: "While the simplicity of Satrapi's style enhances its accessibility, some might argue that it occasionally sacrifices nuance or complexity in the portrayal of certain characters or events."
*   **Conclusion:** Add an element of the importance of this work, especially now, given its themes of revolution, war, the veil, and immigration.

**Proofreading:**

*   Double-check for any minor grammatical errors or typos.

**In summary:**

This is a very good essay that demonstrates a strong understanding of *Persepolis* and the critical discourse surrounding it. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can further refine your analysis and make your argument even more compelling. Good job!
