Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, with suggestions for improvement.

**Overall Impression**

The paper is well-structured and presents a clear argument: that *The Vicar of Wakefield* fails as a traditional Christian morality story. The student demonstrates a good understanding of morality plays and how they contrast with Goldsmith's novel. The writing is generally clear, but it could be more concise and impactful in places.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Argument:** The thesis is well-defined and consistently argued throughout the paper. The essay does a good job of stating its purpose clearly and following through.
*   **Strong Introduction:** The introduction effectively sets the stage by defining morality stories and contrasting them with *The Vicar of Wakefield*.
*   **Good Use of Examples:** The student uses specific examples from *The Vicar of Wakefield*, *Everyman*, and *King Lear* to support their claims.
*   **Well-Organized:** The essay follows a logical progression, making it easy to follow the argument.
*   **Solid Understanding:** The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the literary concepts and texts being discussed.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Defining "Failed":** Elaborate more explicitly on *how* The Vicar fails. What expectations of a Christian morality story are unmet? This might involve more direct engagement with the core tenets of Christian morality, and how the novel deviates from them.
*   **Thesis Precision:** Could be more refined and focused. While the thesis states it is a "failed Christian morality story," it could be more specific about the reasons *why* it fails.
*   **Depth of Analysis:** Some points could be developed further. For instance, the discussion of the changing morals and the influence of the rising middle class is interesting but could be expanded upon.
*   **Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments. For example, could one argue that the novel is *intentionally* subverting traditional morality? Is it a satire? Acknowledging opposing viewpoints strengthens the overall argument.
*   **Conciseness:** Some sentences and phrases could be tightened. This will improve the clarity and impact of the writing.
*   **Strengthening the Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the argument, but it could be more impactful. It could offer a final thought or implication of the analysis.

**Specific Suggestions:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   **Tighten:** "Morality stories and plays that espouse Christian values have been incredibly popular in the history of English literature" could be more direct.  e.g., "Christian morality stories have been a staple of English literature."
    *   **Clarify Goldsmith's Purpose:** Indicate that Goldsmith's intention is *not* necessarily to create a traditional morality tale.
    *   **Strengthen thesis:** Add more information about how and why it is a failed Christian morality story.

*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   **"Christian Morality Story" Definition:** Consider whether this is best done in the introduction or the body.
    *   **Everyman and King Lear:** Use these as direct foils to *The Vicar of Wakefield*. Explicitly compare and contrast the moral lessons taught.
    *   **Lack of Christian Fortitude:** Develop this point more fully. What specific actions or decisions by the characters contradict Christian values? Connect it more clearly to the idea of a "failed" morality story.
    *   **Changing Morals:** This is a very interesting point. Elaborate on the specific changes and the influence of the rising middle class. Provide more context and analysis. Link this point to the failures in Christian morality.
    *   **Reciprocity:** This is a key part of your analysis. Perhaps it deserves its own paragraph. Make sure you define reciprocity here and explain how it impacts the novel's message.
    *   **Loyalty vs. Pride:** Expand on the tension between these two. Is Goldsmith suggesting that traditional notions of loyalty are problematic?

*   **Conclusion:**
    *   **Reiterate the main points succinctly.**
    *   **Offer a final thought:** What are the implications of *The Vicar of Wakefield* being a "failed" morality story? Does it suggest a shift in values? Does it challenge traditional notions of morality?

**Example Edits:**

*   **Original:** "Morality stories and plays that espouse Christian values have been incredibly popular in the history of English literature."
    *   **Revised:** "Christian morality stories have been a staple of English literature."
*   **Original:** "This is precisely why The Vicar of Wakefield fails to be a true Christian moral story."
    *   **Revised:** "The Vicar of Wakefield fails as a traditional Christian morality story because it prioritizes earthly rewards over spiritual salvation, and the characters' actions often contradict the principles they espouse."

**Additional Tips:**

*   **Consider Authorial Intent:** Does Goldsmith aim for didacticism, or is the novel more nuanced?
*   **Engage with Scholarly Criticism:** Incorporating insights from other scholars can strengthen your argument.
*   **Proofread Carefully:** Check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.

By addressing these points, you can elevate this already strong essay to an even higher level. You have a solid foundation, and these suggestions will help you refine your argument and analysis. Good luck!
