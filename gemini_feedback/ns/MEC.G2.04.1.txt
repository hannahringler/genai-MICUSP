Okay, here's some feedback on the paper, covering various aspects:

**Overall Impression:**

The paper appears to be a solid piece of work on a challenging robotics problem. It's well-structured, clearly explains the background and methodology, and presents simulation results to support its claims. The use of virtual constraints and stability analysis based on the Poincaré map is a strong approach.

**Strengths:**

*   **Problem Motivation:** The paper makes a convincing argument for studying point-foot robots, highlighting the challenges of underactuation and the limitations of traditional ZMP methods.
*   **Simulation Results:** The simulation results are presented clearly, with graphs illustrating the joint angles, convergence, and output functions. The side-by-side comparison of finite-time and exponential controllers is valuable.

*   **Clarity:** The paper, while understandable, could benefit from further simplification of language and reduction of jargon.
*   **Figures:**
    *   Consider making the graphs larger and ensuring that the axes labels are easily readable.
    *   Figure 4 could benefit from a more descriptive caption that explains the mapping, stable manifold, and convergence.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **"Various methods are used; one of the easiest to implement in practice is a robot with 4-6 legs to solve the balancing problem."** This could be improved. It sounds like multi-legged robots make bipedal walking easier, which isn't true. Rephrase it to say that multi-legged robots solve the locomotion problem with static stability easier than the dynamic balance of bipedal robots.
*   **"All theorems and methods presented here can be found in [2]."** Add context here to make clear that the paper applies research from other sources to the 3-link walker.

**Abstract**

Bipedal walking is a challenging robotics problem due to its complex dynamics and inherent underactuation. The zero-moment point heuristic presents limitations when dealing with the dynamic nature of bipedal walking. This paper explores using virtual constraints as a solution to define walking gaits. With this approach, stability analysis can occur on the zero dynamics manifold instead of the dynamics as a whole. Simulations of a 3-link bipedal robot were performed to validate this approach using both finite-time and exponential controllers. Results of two gait patterns are shown, a simple periodic gait, and a modified gait optimized for energy efficiency.

**Introduction**

Walking robots have been a popular science fiction fantasy since the mid 20th century. Bipedal robots solve problems that include search and rescue, and elderly assistance. The control community has been actively working on this problem for several decades. Various methods are used; one of the easiest to implement in practice is a robot with 4-6 legs to solve the balancing problem. Bipedal, human-like walking is much more difficult.

Human walking is fundamentally difficult to emulate because it is a highly dynamic process with many states and little static stability. Many existing bipedal robots get around this problem by altering the gait properties to eliminate the dynamic balancing problem; Honda's Asimo is perhaps the most famous example. This method is termed the "Zero Moment Point" method and is discussed in Section 2.

The goal of this project is to study the bipedal locomotion problem using nonlinear control techniques in a systematic way. Stable walking gaits correspond to stable periodic orbits in the state space. By using a variety of techniques, control is applied to create these orbits, specific orbits are identified, and their stability can be proven. These controllers are then simulated on the full-dimensional robot model and shown to create the desired walking gait.

These methods have been extensively developed and applied to complicated robots [2], including hardware testing on a 5-link robot. The work presented here applies the methods of [2] to a simple 3-link walker; All theorems and methods presented here can be found in [2]. The main techniques used are Lagrangian Dynamics, Poincaré maps, hybrid systems, zero dynamics, and feedback linearization.

The outline of this report is as follows: The robot continuous dynamics and impact map are derived. A simple walking gait is chosen. A periodic orbit is found and proved stable for two different types of controllers. The zero dynamics are studied. Finally, a more complicated, energy-efficient gait is studied.
